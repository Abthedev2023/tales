    <br>
    I have loved watersports, especially wetting myself, since I was about 13. It is good to
    come across a site with others! I saw a few stories there, and though I could tell you
    heaps, here is one that happened last month...<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I decided to leave work early to do some shopping - my job allows for that kind of thing.
    Because it is important to what happened, I was in a full body suit, stockings, shortish
    shirt and blouse. I had drunk a bit at lunch (a going away party) and was a little tipsy
    too...<br>
    <br>
    It was walking around one of the department stores that I realised I desperately needed to
    pee. I guess I had been holding it for a while, but now it was a need. I had also just
    drank a large coke to try and &quot;pep me up,&quot; and that was no doubt reaching my
    bladder - it didn't help that my skirt was tight either...<br>
    <br>
    I don't know why (alcohol?), but I decided to see how long I could hold it - I love doing
    this, and was already becoming turned on. I went downstairs and got another coke, and
    despite the growing pain, drank it as fast as I could.<br>
    <br>
    I then headed down to the botanical gardens (about a 10 minute walk) and by the time I got
    there, was absolutely bursting. I decided this was enough, so went to the one set of
    toilets there - and they were closed for maintenance! Shit!<br>
    <br>
    Knowing the only other toilets were back at the shops, I headed off at full speed to try
    and get there, and immediately a little spurt came out of my hole. I ran into an area I
    know is usually quiet, so maybe I could let a little out, but there were two girls talking
    there... They got up as I came in, so I hung around till they left...<br>
    <br>
    Now here is the problem - I had a pair of stockings on (which came above the top of my
    skirt) and a full body suit with no clips at the bottom (bloody cheap Target stuff) - so I
    ended up just standing there and letting a whole lot come out. Damn it felt good!<br>
    <br>
    While I was still peeing though, the two girls came back and just stood there and stared
    at me! I think they must have understood though, because they soon moved on (I still
    wonder what they thought, and whether they enjoyed it)... I had stopped myself now, and
    started off for the shopping center. My legs and crotch were completely soaked, and I was
    leaving drips all along the place.<br>
    <br>
    When I finally got to the shopping center (it seemed hours), I ended up having to let some
    more go on a long escalator (it was kind of empty - and anyway, I was already soaked
    through) and finally made it to the toilet to finish off.<br>
    <br>
    It was kind of embarrassing having people see me wet myself - but also a turn on. I had
    the best orgasm in the carpark in my car I have had in a long time... And then I still got
    to drive home completely soaked!</span><br>
