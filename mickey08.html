    <br>
    <br>
    I know the title of the story kind of gives away the ending, but nonetheless this was my
    most recent desperation sighting.<br>
    <br>
    A month ago or so my girlfriend invited me to hang with her and her friends one night.
    They were throwing a small bachelorette party for this one girl who was getting married in
    a couple of months. I was to be the only guy hanging out with these women on this night.
    They all liked me and didn't mind having me around. I would be kind of chauffeuring them
    around later that night as well.<br>
    <br>
    I met my girlfriend Ashley at about nine o'clock or so and headed over to this one girl's
    house where everyone was gathering. In thinking about the evening, it never crossed my
    mind that being around all of these girls that were drinking so heavily might actually
    allow me to witness some desperation.<br>
    <br>
    The girls were all gathered in the kitchen having drinks and gossiping so I headed into
    the living room with a beer and turned on the basketball game.<br>
    <br>
    At about 10:30 the girls decided it was time to hit the bar scene. I drove a car full of
    girls uptown and another girl drove another car full. We hit one bar for maybe close to an
    hour. I was in charge of refilling the beer pitchers. The girls were all being very nice
    to me and I really didn't mind being the only guy. After we left that bar we headed down
    the street a little ways to another bar. All the girls were buzzing after all of their
    drinks between the house and the first bar. I piled all eight girls in my Jeep Wrangler
    because the other girl that had driven was slightly drunk by this time, so I was the only
    driver option.<br>
    <br>
    We arrived at the other bar and the girls resumed putting away the pitchers of beer. After
    about another hour there they decided to check out this one frat party that their friends
    were hosting. Of course, I had to drive them all there. So, once again all eight girls
    piled in my Jeep. I had three girls sitting in the front seat and five in the back. It was
    going to be about a 20-minute drive and I was hoping not to get pulled over by the cops.<br>
    <br>
    About 10 minutes into the drive my ears perked up when a girl named Jill leaned forward
    from the back seat and whispered to my girlfriend Ashley in the front seat, &quot;Hey
    Ashley, as soon as we get to this house you have to show me where the bathroom is. I
    really have to go!!!&quot; Ashley assured her she would, as she was the only one of the
    girls that been to this house before.<br>
    <br>
    I noticed all the other girls were continuously talking except for Jill. She had gotten
    pretty silent and I suspected she had to go pretty bad. After all, these girls had been
    drinking so much beer and they had all been peeing pretty frequently at the bars, from
    what I had noticed.<br>
    <br>
    Another five minutes later we were sitting in traffic when one of the girls in the back
    must have fallen onto Jill. Obviously landing on Jill's full bladder upset her a bit,
    &quot;Ouch!! Laurie please get off me!!&quot; The other girls were startled by the urgent
    tone in Jill's voice and began asking her if she was okay.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm okay, it's just I have to pee soooo bad right now! It's not even funny you
    guys... are we almost there?&quot; Jill begged.<br>
    <br>
    Ashley again assured her that we were just a few minutes away. A couple of the girls in
    the back tried to comfort her by saying that they really needed to pee as well. This was
    getting pretty good for me. Jill leaned forward to Ashley again, &quot;Ash, don't
    forget... you have to get me to the bathroom as soon as we get there. I can't hold it much
    longer, OK?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    We got the house a couple of minutes later and immediately Jill began begging the girls to
    hurry up piling out of the car. Our group walked quickly towards the house with a very
    nervous Jill towards the front.<br>
    <br>
    As we got to the front of the house Ashley recognized some of her friends that greeted
    her. This was total agony for Jill as Ashley was supposed to lead her to the bathroom and
    was now caught up with friends. Jill was doing her best to hide her obvious need to pee.
    She couldn't keep still as she shifted her weight from leg to leg while keeping them
    tightly crossed. Looking very concerned she suddenly pulled Ashley's sleeve and begged her
    to come with her. Ashley excused herself from her friends and began to lead us inside.
    Once inside she led Jill past a couple groups of people and towards the back of the house.
    As we turned a corner we saw the bathroom, and quite a line that was coming out of it.
    Jill looked like she was about to cry at the sight of it. There were guys and girls in the
    only bathroom available and Jill began trying to push her way by. I secretly was hoping
    someone would deny her and make her wait, maybe causing her to have an accident. She did
    get held up somewhat. I was able to get a glimpse of her waiting behind one girl in line.
    She did crouch down to the ground once and stay there for about four seconds. I swear I
    thought she was wetting her pants when she did that. When she stood back up the next girl
    went in the stall. I was trying to make sure that no one knew that I was staring at her. I
    looked back and she had both hands in her crotch with her legs tightly crossed. She looked
    like she was holding on with everything that she had. She was taking deep breaths and not
    looking around. Although the other girl was only inside for maybe two minutes it probably
    seemed like an hour to Jill. She about knocked the girl over as she was exiting the stall.
    From that point on I stopped watching, scared one of the girls would call me out on it.<br>
    <br>
    Jill came back out with dry pants and a very relieved look on her face. We joined the
    party and the girls kept on drinking throughout the night. Ashley made me stay with her
    later than some of the other girls. Most of them caught a cab back to the girls' house
    because they wanted to leave earlier. I took Ashley, Beth and Jill back to the house
    later. As we were driving home the subject of needing to pee came up. I definitely stayed
    quiet and caught Jill saying that if just one more girl had been in front of her in line
    that she would have wet her pants. She said she was so scared, I mean, who wants to do
    that at a frat party, of all places? She said a couple of drops had started to come out
    and that she just barely got her pants down before she let loose. Just listening to her
    description of how good it felt to finally go gave me a hard on. Of course I just wish
    that she hadn't made it. I haven't seen any accidents since my time with Casey and Kendra
    who I haven't spent much time with since I started dating Ashley. But... maybe I'll have
    to give them a call. I know they like to play along.<br>
    <br>
    Till then... be good everyone! <br>
