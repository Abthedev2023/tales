    Emily and I had hit it off from the time we had first met at a political gathering. She
    had approached me to provide positive commentary on something I had said at the meeting.
    From then on, I could easily tell she was sucking up to me, praising my
    &quot;brilliance,&quot; but in such a delicious way!<br>
    <br>
    We dated for a few weeks. I invited her over to my place for dinner, and she reciprocated
    at hers. There's a considerable age difference between us, so initially we engaged as
    &quot;friend and mentor.&quot; Then one weekend when we were out hiking in an isolated
    canyon, she turned to me and said coyly, &quot;I need a bathroom, but I really detest the
    idea of dropping my trousers in this buggy place. Would you be terribly offended if just I
    went in my pants?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    You could have hit me with a bolt of lightning. I told her, &quot;No,&quot; then stood
    there and watched as this tantalizing, slim, buxom young morsel slowly soaked her
    light-colored jeans from crotch to ankle. We walked back to trailhead with her in front
    and my eyes riveted on the fascinating pattern of rivulets on the back of her pants. It
    occurred to me that I could have pounded any offending rattlers with the hard rod
    straining within my own trousers!<br>
    <br>
    That night at my place, Emily turned to me and said, &quot;I got into your picture files
    the first night I was over here for dinner. I know what you like. You're mine now!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I had no argument to counter that. After a short round of red-faced stammering and
    stuttering on my part, Emily took my hand and led me into the bathroom. She slid down her
    pretty panties, sat down on the toilet, and spread her legs to afford me a heavenly vision
    of her thick blonde crotch filaments as a golden stream poured out from underneath her.
    Then she led me off to bed, where her exclamations included, &quot;My god! I had no idea
    it could be like this!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Since that time, sweet Emily has made it a point to please me in any manner she can
    ascertain. She's sort of a hippy type who usually dresses in jeans and t-shirts, but she's
    allowed me to provide her with a snazzy, first class wardrobe with the shoes and bags and
    all the bells and whistles. Emily adores being out with me, attending a conference or
    whatever, and allowing a slim trail of urine to pour down her legs onto her designer
    shoes, with the crowd around us being none the wiser. This certainly has the effect of
    keeping me awake and alert, no matter how boring the lecturer!<br>
    <br>
    She also likes to be in adult diapers when she's out with me. She'll turn to me suddenly
    and say, &quot;Daddy, Emily panties getting very, very wet!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I can't predict where all this is leading, but I'm certainly having the time of life while
    it lasts!<br>
