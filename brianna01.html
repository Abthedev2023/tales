    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jennifer sat in her
    room, flicking through the channels on her 50-inch television. This was a very warm spring
    day, so she was reclined in her lazy-boy, quickly sipping lemonade from the large mug in
    front of her. Her air conditioner was broken, so naturally the lemonade was her means of
    cooling off. After about an hour, Jennifer had drank the entire pitcher of lemonade. She
    was finally cool, but she still couldn't find anything to watch on TV.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The breeze was beginning to pick up,
    so Jennifer decided not to make another pitcher of lemonade. In fact, she had decided that
    she would use her new charge card at the mall. She put the pitcher back into the kitchen,
    and was about to go to her room to change into something more suitable for her
    conservative taste. The tight shorts and the belly top she wore were just not going to
    work.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Just as she was on her way upstairs
    she locked the door and was about to close it, but she heard a sound at her mailbox. She
    was expecting a letter from her mother about something very important. She ran outside and
    looked to see what had arrived in the mailbox. No letter. As she approached her porch, the
    breeze slammed her door shut.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Damnit!!!&quot; she said out
    loud because she knew that she left her keys in the house. &quot;I will just have to try
    to climb into an open window.&quot; She walked around to the back of the house so that it
    wouldn't be obvious that she was locked out. She saw that the window in the kitchen was
    open, but it was too high for her to jump into. While Jennifer was looking for something
    to stand on, she realized that the pitcher of lemonade had caught up with her. At the rate
    she had drank it, it wanted out- and quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She danced around and she found a
    lawn chair that she had happened to leave outside. As she walked over to it, she felt a
    tremendous pressure in her bladder. She hurriedly grabbed the chair and ran over to the
    window. She stood on the chair, but just as she lifted one leg, she heard the chair crack
    as if it would give way. This scared her, and a trickle of piss ran into her panties. She
    quickly shoved her hand into her crotch and regained control.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Damnit, this would happen when
    I need to get in the house.&quot; she mumbled. She tried to raise her leg again, but this
    time the chair totally broke. Jennifer fell right along with the chair. She quickly rushed
    to her feet, realizing that she was peeing full force into her tight shorts and panties.
    As she was slowly gaining control of her bladder, the neighbor's automatic sprinkler
    system cut on. This was too much and now Jennifer couldn't gain control of her bladder.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
    Piss was shooting from between her legs and running into her shoes. She desperately tried
    to yank down her shorts, but she was so shocked that she was pissing her pants; all she
    could do was fumble with the fly.&nbsp; Jennifer was totally soaking her shorts. She began
    crying as she pissed even harder into her skin-tight shorts. Jennifer pissed for almost 40
    seconds. When she was done, her shorts were soaking wet.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
