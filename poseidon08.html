     Accidental 
      Discovery<br>
    </strong>
    </font><br><br>Maureen glanced up from her computer, suddenly becoming aware that the 
      office was strangely quiet. Looking back to her screen she found that the 
      clock showed a quarter to seven, she was alone and security would soon be 
      round to lock up. Still, at least she had completed this horribly complex 
      report. Saving it, she clicked on print and leaned back in her chair.<br><br>As she relaxed her concentration she noticed something else - she was 
      bursting for a wee. Thinking back she realised she hadn't been to the loo 
      since lunch time and, while concentrating so hard on the report had 
      managed to suppress the increasing pain in her bladder. She often did 
      this, in fact she was renowned for it, always seemingly able to hold on 
      much longer than her friends, and almost always without mishap. OK, so she 
      had occasionally leaked a little when laughing hard while bursting, but 
      then didn't most women?<br><br>What Maureen didn't appreciate immediately was just how badly she 
      needed to go. She had waited so long this time that her bladder muscles 
      were almost numb with the strain. Checking that the system was about to 
      print she felt the twinges in her bladder and decided that she really must 
      take that walk up the corridor to the Ladies, knowing that if she didn't 
      there was a real danger that she was going to wet her knickers at her 
      desk.<br><br>She stood up and immediately knew the extent of her predicament. The 
      effect of gravity made her suddenly desperate. Legs crossed and two or 
      three quick curtseys helped, as did the hand clasped tightly to her crotch 
      through her skirt. The thought flashed through her mind that she really 
      was going to have an accident in her knickers if she didn't get to the loo 
      quickly, but quickly was not possible in her state.<br><br>She stood there for what seemed like an age, legs tightly crossed as 
      she struggled to keep control. As soon as she felt the spasms pass she 
      headed for the door. A few steps and she felt a warm spreading wetness in 
      her pants. Instinctively she clamped her legs together and managed to stop 
      herself from losing all control. She felt a wave of panic - could she make 
      it without leaving a puddle on the office carpet?<br><br>Walking gingerly, stopping to squeeze her thighs tightly every step or 
      so she hobbled towards the ladies loo. It was only 30 metres or so but 
      seemed an eternity. She knew she was still dribbling wee into her 
      knickers. The wetness trickling down her legs was clear evidence of that. 
      At last, the loo. Pushing open the door she felt another spasm in her 
      bladder, a familiar feeling when she reached a loo after waiting till 
      desperate. This time was different, her control was already breaking down. 
      This time she could't hold on with impunity. Pulling up her skirt as she 
      went Maureen stumbled towards the welcoming toilet.<br><br>Then, steps away from the safety of the cubicle the dam burst. She 
      didn't even feel herself lose control, just the flood down her leg and the 
      splashing of her wee on the tiled floor. She wet for several seconds 
      before regaining some control, looking down in horror at the puddle round 
      her feet. Quickly, she rushed into the cubicle, trying and failing to pull 
      down her knickers and tights as she did so. Another spurt of wee into her 
      pants and she gave up the fight, collapsing onto the toilet, as all 
      control gone, she emptied her aching bladder through her already soaking 
      knickers.<br><br>She weed for ages and as the flow died away considered the horror of 
      what she had done. All these years she had managed to hold on in all sorts 
      of desperate situations with her underwear rarely even damp. Now here she 
      was, 28 years old and she had just totally wet her knickers at work. But 
      what was she to do now? At least she was on her own with no colleagues 
      around, but she still had to get out to her car and drive home. She only 
      carried spare knickers during her period, so she had nothing to change 
      into, and anyway, her handbag was still locked in her desk.<br><br>What was worse, going home without underwear at all, or wearing wet 
      knickers and tights? She decided to keep them on, after drying herself and 
      her clothes as best she could with paper towels. Back in the office she 
      finished binding the report then gathering her things, walked awkwardly to 
      the lift and on out to her car, feeling her knickers and tights clinging 
      damply to her, rubbing her gently between her legs.<br><br>The drive home was slow in heavy traffic and she soon found she needed 
      to wee again - she had not fully emptied herself earlier and her strained 
      muscles didn't help in holding it. She reached home and parked the car, 
      finding renewed desperation as she got out of the car and headed for the 
      front door. Where was her key? Standing there, hopping from foot to foot 
      she searched the bottom of her handbag. Got it! Key in the lock. No, not 
      again!<br><br>Before Maureen could even get inside the door the hot wetness poured 
      down her legs again. This time she made no attempt to stem the flow. 
      Safely inside the door she felt the soaking wetness of her knickers 
      between her legs, the warm wee trickling over her fingers as she squeezed 
      herself. As she finished wetting her knickers for the second time in two 
      hours her body responded to the pleasure, relief and her massaging fingers 
      in the most pleasant way possible.<br><br>
