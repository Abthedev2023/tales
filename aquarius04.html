    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was sitting on the steps just
    around the corner from the club, head back against the wall, a small sack halfway off her
    shoulders, belly bared, and with a small pool under her butt. Melanie stopped to look at
    her. Late teens, probably, left behind when drink had gotten to her head and her
    companions wanted to party on. A pretty girl, long-limbed, with straight fair hair and a
    pale complexion; she looked almost transparent in her vulnerability. The dark stain on her
    jeans added to the helpless look.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie bent to shake her shoulder.
    &quot;Hey. Please, wake up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl moaned.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come on. You can't sit
    here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She opened a pair of round blue eyes
    and looked up at Melanie. &quot;What's...? Where are they? Who are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;They've probably gone
    somewhere else. Anyway, I don't think you ought to stay here all night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;God, I'm dizzy. Got to pee,
    too. Where did they go to?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't know, Melanie said.
    &quot;Where were you going?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm supposed to stay with
    Sarah. I can't go home like this!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie reached out for her.
    &quot;Come on,&quot; she said. &quot;I live ten minutes away. You can stay with me, get
    some sleep, and take your bearings tomorrow morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can't just go along with
    some stranger.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;All right, better introduce
    myself. My name is Melanie, I'm twenty-six, single, and my favorite drink is Spanish wine.
    Now I'm no stranger, silly. Better me than a strange man, right? Come on, then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl let Melanie help her to her
    unsteady feet. &quot;Got to pee,&quot; she said. &quot;Is it far?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ten minutes. Can you do
    that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Dunno. All right.&quot; She
    rubbed her eyes and brushed her hair back, straightened her sack and tried in vain to pull
    her jumper down. &quot;Okay.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie looked at her narrow hips,
    small breasts and bare navel, and fell in love immediately. She put her arm around the
    girl, steadying her. The girl sighed gratefully and let herself be led. She walked slowly,
    showing her effort to hold her pee back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Is it far? I really got to
    go.&quot; She touched herself: &quot;Oh no!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's okay,&quot; Melanie said.
    &quot;You just had a little accident.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl sniffled and looked
    pleadingly at Melanie. &quot;I've got to go so bad!&quot; She halted, squirming, and
    plucked at her waist. &quot;I have to! Help me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie looked around for a
    sheltered spot, but the girl was already unzipping her jeans, and squatted on the
    pavement. Melanie had to steady her to keep her from toppling over.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finished, she rose and started
    pulling up her jeans. Melanie noticed she had forgotten to remove her panties before
    peeing, and her shoes were splattered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl took a few deep breaths and
    smiled weakly at Melanie. &quot;Thanks. You're kind. I feel a lot better now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They walked on, arm in arm for
    support. The story was simple. Her name was Nina, and she had gone out with some friends
    after telling a cover story of sleeping over. She was almost twenty-one, but almost is not
    enough when facing zealous doormen. The others had entered the club and left her outside
    with her bottle of vodka and coke. She had drunk the rest, cried a little, and fallen
    asleep in spite of an urgent need to relieve herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie unlocked the door and led
    her up to the apartment. She helped Nina remove the sack. She stood in the middle of the
    room looking lost, feet together, a tiny belly over the very low-cut jeans, white sweater
    hugging the buns on her chest.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Bathroom to the left,&quot;
    Melanie said. &quot;Towels under the sink if you'd like a shower. Got any spare
    clothes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Only panties. I'm sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll see what I can find. Just
    take your time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina smiled gratefully and closed
    the door behind her. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie looked at herself in the
    hall mirror. Short, dark hair that resisted most treatment, breasts on the heavy side
    under the turtleneck sweater, faded jeans. She gave herself a short smile and went to look
    for some extra clothes. She found some garments in the bottom drawer, and went back to the
    bathroom. Hesitating, she paused before knocking.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come in,&quot; she heard
    through the sound of the water.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She could see Nina through the
    frosted glass of the cabinet, hair in ponytail, rinsing off the soap. She stared at the
    small black triangle below the small belly, visible as an out-of-focus shape on her
    slender body. Melanie felt a tingle in her sex.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Got some change for you,&quot;
    she said. &quot;Mind if I pee?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Not at all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie pulled her Levi's and
    panties down, and sat on the bowl. Nina turned the water off just as the stream started to
    flow, and stepped out, still a little unsteady. Without hurrying she wrapped a towel
    around herself, and smiled at Melanie. &quot;Feels good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It could have been a question or a
    statement, so Melanie just smiled back. She wiped, and pulled her jeans up. &quot;I'll
    make some tea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie looked up as Nina entered
    the sitting room. The T-shirt was an exact fit, and the white pants were just a little too
    tight. &quot;These aren't yours?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;My cousin stays here
    sometimes. She's only twelve, but I thought they might fit you anyway.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I like them, really.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You look very beautiful,
    Nina.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her eyes were moist. &quot;Thanks,
    Melanie.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She patted the sofa. &quot;Come and
    sit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie could smell the girlish
    freshness from her, and she felt another sting in her underbelly. As Nina sat the pants
    rode down on her narrow hips, leaving the string of her panties a couple if inches above
    them.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;So, tell me. Got a
    boyfriend?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No, not now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Girlfriend?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She giggled. &quot;Oh no.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ever been with a girl?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina hesitated: &quot;Well, kind of.
    My friend Sarah - she frowned - who left me tonight; we used to hold hands, kissed a
    couple of times. Once when she slept over, it sort of just happened.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;How?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You know, we were just
    talking, lying face to face, and then I kissed her on the mouth. She stroked me, suddenly
    we were embracing, and she pressed her leg between mine. I nearly wet myself. I touched
    her breasts, and she wondered if she could touch me down there. Well, she did. And she put
    my hand down her panties. So we helped each other. She told me to never tell anybody. I
    just did, didn't I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I won't tell.&quot; Melanie
    smiled and patted her thigh. &quot;You tired yet? You can sleep here, on the sofa.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Not really. My head is still
    swimming.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie drained her mug. &quot;This
    flows right through me,&quot; she said, and stood up. &quot;Got to pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina rose. &quot;Me too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie swallowed and motioned Nina
    to precede her to the bathroom. Her eyes were fixed to Nina's cute little butt and long
    legs. Slowly, savoring the moment, Melanie unbuttoned her jeans and pulled down her
    panties. Nina's eyes widened as she saw Melanie's hairless sex. Melanie sat down and let
    it flow.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I liked that,&quot; Nina said
    softly. &quot;You look so clean. Pure.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It feels good,&quot; Melanie
    replied. &quot;Sensitive, like.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She pulled up her panties, not
    caring about the little drop that spread in her crotch. Nina pulled down the short zipper
    on her white pants and wriggled them down her hips. The black triangle was faintly visible
    through the thin nylon before the panties went down. She sat on the bowl, knees together,
    sighing as the stream ran. She wiped and rose, pulled up and zippered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Maybe I'm a little tired after
    all,&quot; she said, yawning.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll get some sheets and
    blankets,&quot; Melanie said. &quot;Just borrow my toothbrush if you like.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina smiled gratefully. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melanie opened her eyes, awoken by a
    small sound. She saw Nina in the doorway, a slender shape outlined by the light in the
    hallway. She was naked. Without a word Melanie pulled the blanket aside, and the younger
    girl lay down beside her. A trembling hand reached out, settling on Melanie's waist.
    Melanie wriggled out of the T-shirt and pulled Nina close, feeling the warm tears against
    her cheek. Breast to breast, belly to belly, the two girls slept soundly through the
    night. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the light filtered through the
    curtains Melanie awoke against Nina's back, arms around her, one hand cupping a small
    pointed breast, feeling Nina's butt against her lap. She kissed her softly on the neck and
    was rewarded with a small purring sound. She stroked the curves of her waist, resting for
    a moment on Nina's hip, before sliding her hand down to the curls. Nina opened her legs
    slightly, letting her hand in. Melanie felt the warm moisture, slipping a finger between
    the lips. Nina sighed and moved her hips to ease the way. Melanie used her finger
    carefully, stroking, entering.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I have to pee again,&quot;
    Nina whispered. &quot;Afraid I'll wet your bed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Wait,&quot; Melanie said.
    Quickly she rose and got a big towel from the bureau. &quot;Just lift your pretty little
    butt a bit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina rolled over and arched her back
    while Melanie slid the towel under her. &quot;Now it's okay, sweet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina spread her legs and received
    Melanie's hand. She moaned, pushing back against it. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said as a small
    spurt escaped.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's alright,&quot; Melanie
    whispered in her ear. &quot;Pee if you want to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The hot wee ran over Melanie's hand
    in pulses as Nina rose to climax. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They rested, arms around each other.
    Then Nina's hands began to explore Melanie's body. Fondling her round breasts, stroking
    her belly, gingerly touching the soft mound through her panties. Melanie nearly wet
    herself from pleasure. Nina turned Melanie on her back, and slid down between her spread
    legs. She kissed her through the panties, sensing the warm girl smell. The white cotton
    accentuated the shape of Melanie's hairless fanny, and Nina burrowed her face in Melanie's
    crotch. She reached up to touch her nipples, tasting a warm flow as Melanie's body
    shuddered. She liked the taste of Melanie's pee. &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered,
    &quot;just go in your panties. Just like I did yesterday.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She teased Melanie's nipples again,
    and another spurt soaked through the panties. Nina lifted her face, reached for the wet
    towel and placed it under Melanie. She watched as a long release soaked the cotton and the
    towel, before pulling the panties aside and lowering her mouth to Melanie's naked fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nina was very thirsty.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
