    Question</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
    </span></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There comes a time in
    all relationships when the big question is asked. It may be after sex, or when waking up
    in the morning, or after a few drinks in the evening. The circumstances seem right when
    she fidgets, or moves her legs, or pats her belly, or seems to look at the door while
    mumbling I'm sorry, where's the - I've got to...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then comes the question: -Can I come
    with you? Some girls just stare at me. Some laugh. Some giggle and shake their heads. Some
    need to be convinced. Some girls look me in the eyes and nod.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sheila was the shy one. After being
    asked ten times she finally said OK and blushed. She worked her panties down under her
    long skirt, covered the bowl with it, and blushed again when she heard the sound. She
    asked me to turn around while she wiped herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Annie shook her head and refused to
    go. She sat on my couch with legs beneath her, stroking her denim legs, biting her lip.
    Finally she just had to go, and her pleading eyes kept me seated. Coming back, she
    straddled me, and we had great sex.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Emma didn't care. She lifted her
    skirt, pulled down, and stared into space as if I wasn't there. Then we went to see a
    film.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Joanna was a fast and frequent peer,
    and she always informed me about the status of her bladder, ranging from full to bursting.
    She wore leggings to ease the pulling down, wriggled her way, laughed at the sound of the
    stream, and wiped from the front.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jackie had to rush. When the urge
    came, it was a matter of seconds before the dam burst, so she always played safe by peeing
    before a meal, after a meal, before the coffee, before the drinks, when she entered the
    movie theatre, during the film, and immediately afterwards. When we came home, before we
    went to bed, and once again if she thought there was a chance for sex. And of course,
    after sex, she just had to rush. Fortunately she always left the door open.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Linda preferred going outside. We
    went on a camping trip, and she stayed clear of every public convenience in order to go
    behind a bush, water the grass and leave a stain in her tracksuit. The hunt for secluded
    places made the hikes twice as long, but the view was worth it. I let her go first on
    uphill tracks to get a glimpse of the dark spot in her shorts.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny seldom wore panties. She sat
    in the reclining chair with legs apart and a clear view up her short skirt. She sat on the
    bowl in the same way, legs spread, looking down at herself. She let me wipe.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suzi loved showing me. She put my
    hand on her belly to let me feel her bulging bladder, stood up, squeezed her legs
    together, and asked me to come. She unbuttoned her tight, low-cut jeans, pulling the
    zipper down slowly, wriggled the pants down, turned around, then slid her panties down,
    sat on the toilet and asked for a kiss. We went directly to bed; she didn't wipe.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kate used to have accidents. When
    laughing, coughing and dancing, she couldn't help squirting in her panties. She was
    extremely embarrassed the first time I had my hand under her skirt, inside her pantyhose,
    and she helplessly released small spurts while I was stroking her. On seeing my obvious
    reaction she relaxed, went with the flow and walked home with me, soaked. Kate knew I
    loved it, so she set out to behave carelessly if she wanted to turn me on. She always
    succeeded. The quick smile and the bended knees on the dance floor told me the black pants
    were damp again. One night on the way home she let go completely, stating that she might
    as well since her pants were wet already.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lynn sat on the terrace, dressed in
    light brown jeans and short halter-top, sipping white wine and stroking my hand. -I've got
    to wee, she said. Can I go in my pants?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We're still married.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
