    <br>
    Bruce was to pick Nancy up at 5:00 PM.&nbsp;It was midsummer and Bruce had gotten off
    early from work.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> &nbsp; </span>So Bruce went to his
    favorite bar to while the hours away until it became time to pick Nancy up from her place
    of employment.<br>
    <br>
    Bruce enjoyed a few beers at his favorite bar.&nbsp;As a matter of fact he enjoyed too
    many beers. When he left to pick Nancy up he had already violated the rule of
    six.&nbsp;The rule of six means that when you have had six beers you will probably need to
    pee. And, when you answer that need all subsequent needs become very urgent needs.&nbsp;In
    short, while the first pee when beer drinking can be put off for a long time the next and
    all subsequent calls to pee are urgent.&nbsp;Once one has acknowledged the fact that one
    must pee one becomes faced with the fact that an urge to pee is not something to be toyed
    with.&nbsp;After six or so beers the need to pee is more than a need; it is desperation.
    When Bruce left to go downtown to pick Nancy up he only slightly needed to go to the
    bathroom but by the time Nancy came out to join him the need to go was fairly desperate.
    He had promised Nancy that he would take her to a really great place where they could
    listen to great music and drink beer and have great steaks for dinner.&nbsp;This was going
    to be an evening to remember.&nbsp;But, Bruce had forgotten the influence a few beers
    could have on one's evening.<br>
    <br>
    Nancy was on time and as she slid into the car in her straight and slick skirt, blouse and
    heels she was an appealing figure.&nbsp;Bruce thought that he was the luckiest guy in the
    world for having her company.&nbsp;Bruce also noticed that his need to pee was growing
    rapidly. He was supposed to take Nancy to their preferred bar for a few beers and to a
    Dinner Theater for dinner and a play. As he wheeled out from Nancy's workplace he noticed
    an overwhelming need to pee.&nbsp;Bruce's slight urge upon leaving the bar was becoming an
    overwhelming urge. Bruce simply had to pee and he needed to pee badly.&nbsp;He didn't want
    Nancy to know how badly he had to pee so he kept quiet.<br>
    <br>
    The trip out through several miles of four-lane divided highway was a trip
    indeed.&nbsp;Bruce was shifting lanes and shifting away from what he thought would be slow
    moving vehicles at traffic lights.&nbsp;He was driving in such a way as to keep from
    sitting still for too long a time. He had to pee so badly that he was sure that an
    extended stay at a traffic light would result in a disaster that would mortify him,
    especially with Nancy sitting next to him. He was frantically trying to think of a place
    where he could pee without it being too obvious that he sought out that place for that
    purpose.&nbsp;He desperately needed to pee and he also didn't want Nancy to know how
    desperately he needed to pee.<br>
    <br>
    Finally caught by a traffic light he squirmed until he got a green light and then he
    pulled over into a shopping center. He knew that a department store in that center had a
    public restroom and he decided that he would try to get to that restroom.<br>
    <br>
    Nancy asked, &quot;Why are you stopping here?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I have a package to pick up,&quot; he replied.&nbsp;He opened the car door and swung
    his legs out and as he stood up he lost control of his bladder. He peed and peed his khaki
    pants. He peed his pants until he no longer had to pee. He was standing by his car and he
    had the door open to conceal his disaster from the public but Nancy was well aware of his
    accident. &quot;Goddamn it, I just pissed all over myself,&quot; he wailed. &quot;I tried
    and tried to hold it and I just couldn't. I'd give anything if I hadn't done it in front
    of you, Jesus Christ you must think I am a big loser. I can't take you anywhere like this.
    Jeez, I've gotta change my clothes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nancy just said that she was OK with his accident, as she had had a few
    herself.&nbsp;&quot;You are wet now and we will take care of that, so put that into a
    place where I can draw out your wet pants against mine when I have a similar
    problem.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    At the time it didn't mean much to Bruce.&nbsp;He was standing beside his car and his
    pants were wet from the crotch to the ankles.&nbsp;He was as humiliated as he could be but
    unknown to him Nancy would later show him an even greater degree of
    humiliation.&nbsp;Nancy to this day had never learned to control her bladder. Bruce was
    learning that he and Nancy were made for each other.&nbsp;They had both had wetting
    accidents in front of each other.&nbsp;He was still struggling with the notion that
    boys/men weren't supposed to wet their pants in public and especially not in front of
    their dates.&nbsp;He thought that girls were allowed to commit such humiliating practices.
    &nbsp; But, while he was driving to his apartment he realized that Nancy had already
    humiliated herself in front of him and he thought that these experiences, while not
    common, did happen on occasion. He also thought that Nancy must have been as extremely
    humiliated when she wet herself as he was now. But, he just couldn't bring himself to
    believe that her accident equaled his in humiliation. The wetness of his khakis pushing
    against him was mortifying beyond compare.<br>
    <br>
    Sensing his embarrassment, Nancy sought to assuage his predicament.&nbsp;His face was
    flushed and she knew he wanted to go off somewhere and die. She knew because she had been
    there before. She had been there with Bruce. She reached over and grabbed his penis
    through the soaked pants and squeezed and his penis reacted by getting very hard.<br>
    <br>
    He said, &quot;I'm not supposed to wet myself now that I am a grown man. Goddamn it this
    was not supposed to happen. Can't you see the position I am in? I am driving to my
    apartment to change my clothes when I should be driving you to a great date.&nbsp;I am
    driving to my apartment because I pissed myself like a little kid, for Chrissakes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nancy squeezed harder on his khaki clad penis feeling droplets of urine pouring into her
    hand. He really was soaked.&nbsp;&quot;Why is it so bad for you to have a wetting accident
    and OK for me to have a wetting accident?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because, he answered, &quot;I'm a guy and you're a girl. Guys aren't supposed to wet
    themselves but girls can. Girl golfers, girl track stars, girl tennis players, girl
    flyers.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When is the last time you saw one of those girls wet themselves?&quot; she asked.
    &quot;Yes, some girls may have a problem with bladder control but some guys do
    also.&nbsp;I saw more boys wet themselves in school than girls. And, I may have seen more
    grown men in wet pants than grown girls. Can you list an equal number of experiences where
    girls are more often wet in public than guys?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Bruce had to think long and hard before answering.&nbsp;&quot;As a matter of fact, he
    said, &quot;I've only seen one girl wet herself in public in my entire life.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nancy replied, &quot;The defense rests.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Bruce came back with, &quot;That doesn't make my wet pants feel any better and it doesn't
    help me with the fact that I lost a great deal of masculinity today. I must admit that I
    would like to draw myself into a fetal position into a dark corner and suck my thumb, but
    I won't do such a thing.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nancy said, &quot;Ditto for me when I had my accident the other day.&nbsp;Just keep
    thinking about it and you will see that there isn't a real difference between you and me
    wetting ourselves. Let's just keep the possibility in perspective and keep in mind that
    wet pants do not indicate a lesser human being.&nbsp;Just one who perhaps waited too long
    or maybe tempted fate too much.&quot; She squeezed a bit more and said, &quot;This could
    be the start of a beautiful friendship.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Sensing another need to go, Bruce began to drive with a sense of anticipation. His soggy
    pants weren't so soggy now that Nancy was holding them in her lovely hands and if he had
    another accident before he got to his apartment it would not be so humiliating.&nbsp;So
    much for the trappings of manhood-&nbsp;&quot;I did indeed pee all over myself in front of
    my date and I am probably going to have the best sex in my life.&quot;&nbsp;Amen to
    wetting my pants. <p>&nbsp;</p>
