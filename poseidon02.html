    <br><span lang="N">
      <p>I am nearly 40 now but over the years I have had many little, and 
      sometimes not so little accidents in my knickers. Most women do in my 
      experience, though few are keen to admit it! We all find, both as 
      teenagers, and as we get older that laughing or coughing with a full 
      bladder causes little leaks and damp knickers, as can waiting to long for 
      the loo when desperate, especially if you have had children. In fact I 
      think it must be more common to leak when bursting than it is to lose 
      control completely. If I have to hang on for long time I often find my 
      pants are damp and sometimes quite wet when I finally get to the loo, 
      though rarely do I notice the leaks as they happen!</p>
      <p><br>Which reminds me of the time that I wet myself while sitting on the 
      sofa at home watching TV and didn't even know that I had done it. Having 
      showered earlier I was wearing only knickers, bra and a dressing gown. I 
      lay with my feet up, my husband in the armchair as we drank a beer or two 
      and watched a film. When the program ended I stood up to go up to bed and 
      it was then that my husband noticed the big wet patch where I had been 
      sitting. He immediately asked me if I had wet myself. I didn't even feel 
      wet and so denied it vigorously. He felt the wet spot on the sofa and 
      sniffed his fingers telling me it smelt like wee, and then felt for a wet 
      patch that he saw on the back of my dressing gown. I looked at it but 
      still denied that I had wet my pants.</p>
      <p><br>Pulling me towards him he felt between my legs, saying that my 
      knickers were soaking and how could I deny that I'd sat there and wet 
      myself. I just looked at him, still maintaining that I was dry. It was 
      only when he made me feel my pants myself and I had taken them off and 
      seen that the gusset and seat were sodden that I accepted what had 
      happened. Without being at all aware of what I was doing I had sat there 
      and completely wet my knickers, I hadn't even been desperate so that 
      wasn't the reason. It just happened, my bladder had emptied itself so 
      slowly that I had had no idea that I was leaking..</p>
      <p><br>This was actually quite disconcerting and I was worried that it 
      might happen at work. Its one thing to wet yourself when you are bursting 
      and can't make the loo in time but . . . . This had happened to me once at 
      college when trying to finish an assignment late one night when I had put 
      off going up the corridor to the toilet just that bit too long. That time 
      I had felt the first hot spurt in my knickers and had made a dash for the 
      loo. I didn't quite make it. By the time I got into a cubicle I had weed 
      all down my legs and although I managed to pull my fawn trousers down I 
      finished off by weeing through my knickers as I sat there. I dried off a 
      bit before going back to my room but my trousers were stained down to my 
      knees and it was obvious that I had wet myself.</p>
      <p><br>Something similar happened a few months later but luckily I was 
      wearing a loose skirt. I was working in a bar one busy lunchtime and 
      simply didn't have time to use the loo. At closing time my husband came to 
      collect me. I was just about to leave when I felt a wetness in my pants 
      and realised just how desperate I was - I had forgotten about my need 
      while working but was just about to make an embarrassing puddle on the 
      floor! I rushed for the Ladies, which unfortunately was upstairs. I didn't 
      have time to even think about pulling my knickers down, there wasn't time. 
      I just lifted my skirt, sat down and weed myself through them. Later, 
      outside, I told my boyfriend that in my rush I had forgotten to take my 
      knickers off and had wet them. He loved it, especially as we spent the 
      next two hours in town with me walking about the crowded streets in wet 
      knickers. My skirt was dry nothing showed so I doubt that anyone else knew 
      what I had done except him.</p>
      <p><br>Writing about those little accidents in my knickers has brought 
      back some other memories, including a couple of incidents during holidays. 
      One involved publicly weeing in my swimsuit, the other was more private 
      when I wet the bed in a hotel.</p>
      <p><br>In the first instance I was with my husband and young children on a 
      small but popular beach. I hate using dirty public loos so simply held on, 
      knowing that at some point I would go for a swim and deal with things 
      then. My husband had also told me that the loos were rather unpleasant. 
      Eventually I decided I just had to go, but realised that the tide had gone 
      out leaving a 200 metre walk to the water. That walk was quite a struggle 
      but I just about held on. Well, actually I was feeling rather damp. I had 
      intended to go straight in up to my waist but the youngest child was 
      frightened of the water and wouldn't go to my husband or be left on the 
      sand. I was ankle deep in the rather cold water and that did it. My 
      bladder just gave up and despite several people around me and a child in 
      my arms I just stood there with a hot yellow stream of wee pouring from 
      the crotch of my swimsuit and down my leg. There was just nothing I could 
      do about it. I was a little embarrassed but my husband was very aroused if 
      the size of the bulge in his trunks was any guide!</p>
      <p><br>The second accident took place a couple of years later. My husband 
      and I managed to get a weekend to ourselves and stayed in a country hotel 
      for a couple of nights. A storm kept us awake much of the first night and 
      on the second I slept very deeply. In the early hours of the morning I 
      half woke from a strange dream, wondering why I felt wet. "What's 
      happening, what's going on, I'm all wet", I mumbled, nudging my husband 
      awake. With a grunt he asked me what the matter was. "I'm wet, why am I 
      wet", I replied as still dozy I got out of bed. </p>
      <p><br>Standing there looking at the bed I still didn't realise what I had 
      done. I felt my satin shorts - the seat, leg and crotch were wet. Oh god I 
      thought, I haven't have I. Wetting the bed was not something I did, well, 
      once when pregnant, but then I often had damp knickers then. I reached 
      down to feel the bed and with growing horror found a large wet patch where 
      I had been lying. "Oh my God! I've wet the bed!", I blurted out. "What 
      have you done?", asked my husband, "You can't have", as he felt the wet 
      patch himself. "I've wet myself, oh God I've wet myself, I've wet the bed! 
      How bad is it, can you check it", I sobbed as I sat on the loo, door open 
      and in full view as I emptied what remained in my bladder. Leaving my wet 
      shorts and top in the bath I put on a dressing gown and came back to 
      inspect the damage.</p>
      <p><br>We threw back the covers and found the wet area little bigger than 
      a dinner plate. Lying on my side in a soft bed the wee had pooled by my 
      thigh and been absorbed by the thick under-blanket. Fortunately I had 
      woken up before I totally lost control. Stripping off the sheet we found 
      the mattress almost dry. To dry things off a bit we hung the sheet over a 
      radiator and the under-blanket in front of a fan heater. We snuggled up on 
      the dry side of the bed and by the time we were ready to leave in the 
      morning the wet bedclothes were dry so we put them back on and said 
      nothing, hoping that the stained sheet and faint smell of wee wouldn't be 
      noticed. </p>
      <p><br>My husband found the incident a great turn on but I was simply 
      embarrassed.<br></p></span>
