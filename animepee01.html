    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">MaryBeth Pickman did little to hide
    her annoyance when her mother told her that the family was going to the zoo for her little
    brother Joey's birthday. She was, after all, eighteen years old, an adult and far too old
    to be going to the zoo with a small child. But, her mother had used the famous &quot;as
    long as you're living under my roof, you're living under my rules, and I say you are
    coming,&quot; and MaryBeth was forced to go. She was more than a little upset, thinking it
    unfair for her mother to say that to her, but she had little choice and that Friday found
    herself riding next to an overly excited Joey who did little more than talk about how much
    he wanted to see a real live elephant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With a fall of full, soft brown hair
    that dropped just above her shoulders and a pair of lovely brown eyes, MaryBeth was
    undeniably attractive, beautiful, in fact. Her face was smooth and perfectly formed,
    extremely pleasing and a great smile was the icing on the cake. She was short, but
    embodied the very essence of beauty. Her curves were defined and well formed and she had
    yet to walk past a man without getting a gawk. In her tight, red T-shirt and tight fitting
    blue jeans, she hoped more than anything to flirt with a few guys on this trip, if there
    were any there. And since she was allowed to wander by herself, she intended to look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Before leaving for the hour and a
    half drive to the zoo, the family stopped to fill the gas tank. MaryBeth bought herself a
    twenty-ounce bottle of water and downed it before her father had finished filling the tank
    - she was a speed drinker - it was her second bottle that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ten minutes into the ride,
    MaryBeth's eyes, like they always did on long trips, began to get heavy. Her brother's
    constant chatter became dulled in her drowsiness and minutes later she was asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she woke up, her brother was
    shaking her awake crying &quot;we're here, we're here&quot; in her ear. She groaned and
    slowly exited the car. She smiled. At last she was going to get away from her family and
    maybe meet some hot guys. She threw her arms in the air and bent back, stretching her
    muscles after her long, cramped nap, also taking note of the hot, muscled guy that walked
    by wearing the zoo's uniform; maybe this trip would be fun after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't know about anyone
    else,&quot; she said cheerfully, her mood had gotten considerably better with the
    knowledge that cute guys roamed the area, but suddenly aware of her bladder's fullness.
    &quot;But I really need to use the toilet,&quot; she finished, bending at the knees in
    mock desperation. In reality, though, she thought she would burst.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We all stopped to use the
    bathroom before we got here,&quot; her mom said. &quot;We didn't want to wake you up,
    though. There are bathrooms near the entrance, you can use them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">MaryBeth nodded. She could make it
    to the entrance, no problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But it was a problem. She felt the
    pressure increase with each step and the elephant fountains, spraying a steady stream of
    water from their trunks didn't help her plight any. After about a minute, her pace slowed
    and her family started getting ahead of her. Worse, she felt continually more desperate.
    She walked slightly hunched over but refused to use her hands to help keep it in, not in
    front of all these people!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her parents noticed her lagging
    behind, and slowed their pace for her, but with her ever-increasing desperation she lagged
    farther and farther behind. Afraid that maybe she was sick, her mom dropped back to check
    on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I have some medicine in my
    purse, if you need some,&quot; MaryBeth's mom asked when they caught up. MaryBeth shook
    her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What would make you ask me
    that?&quot; The younger girl asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well,&quot; her mother said,
    &quot;you're moving pretty slow, and you're hunched a bit like your stomach hurts. At
    first glance it looks like you might have diarrhea; do you?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No,&quot; MaryBeth said,
    quickly standing straight up and ignoring the ping of extra pressure on her already very
    full bladder. She was very toilet shy and didn't want anyone knowing she was having an
    emergency, and she also didn't want anyone thinking she had the problem her mother
    suggested. &quot;I just need to pee, I'll be fine,&quot; she said. &quot;Bathrooms are
    right ahead.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But MaryBeth was to find no relief
    in the restrooms outside the gate for an out of order sign hung on the door. When she
    asked, the clerk told her she would have to use the toilets in the park, but since the
    clerk was new, she didn't know where those were located.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Upon entering the park, there were
    three roads to pick from, each leading to a different section of the zoo. Her parents and
    brother decided to take the middle road first and, despite her desperate situation,
    MaryBeth picked the right road, dead set on being alone. How ironic that if she had just
    followed her parents around the bend of the middle road she would have found the restrooms
    she so desired. Going the way she had chosen she had a good twenty-minute march to the
    next rest area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ten minutes into her walk, MaryBeth
    swore she was going to burst. The pressure in her bladder still seemed to be growing and
    it was so full her jeans felt somewhat tighter. She was panting from the fight to hold it
    in, and she knew everyone she passed gave her a glance, not because of her looks, but
    because of her situation. To make matters worse, her road had taken her through the Desert
    Dwellers section of the zoo and there wasn't so much as a shrub for her to squat by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another five minutes passed and
    finally she couldn't take it anymore. She jammed her hands between her legs and clutched
    her crotch tightly, then took off in a desperate run.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In two minutes, the rest area was in
    her sight. She could smell the aroma of grilled hamburgers and fires drifting through the
    air and could hear the causal chatter of families at lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Also, she could barely make out the sign that read 'RESTROOMS.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But her luck didn't hold out. Her
    bladder was so full it was causing her pain and every step she took another small spurt
    found its way out of her pee-hole. Finally, she could take it no longer and released her
    hold in front of more than one hundred people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was whimpering and crying
    silently as it happened. She moved her hands and bent slightly at her knees with her legs
    spread just a little. Instantly a river of golden water poured out of her. It flooded her
    panties and poured from her jeans, as though someone had turned a faucet on insider her
    pants. The urine soaked the seat of her pants quickly, and she felt its warmth seeping
    down her thighs and drenching the sides and back of her jeans. Stray streams filtered
    around to her front, dampening it as well and she could feel what didn't stain her jeans
    cascade down her legs and add its weight to her socks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For what seemed like an eternity she
    stood there peeing, and when her bladder had finally emptied she was a sight to see.
    Scarcely a dry spot remained on her jeans and she stood in a pool of her own yellow urine.
    When the relief had passed, she noticed the cold snickering from the crowd around her. An
    older lady told her she wasn't a baby anymore and she should be ashamed of herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">MaryBeth's upper lip quivered and
    she burst into tears. Trying to shut out the jibes she heard, the humiliated girl dashed
    back to her parents' car where she removed her pants, covered herself with a towel and
    remained until her family returned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
