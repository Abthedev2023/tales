    <br>
    I tightened my carpenter's belt and looked at the rotting foundations. I had taken on the
    job of building a new terrace on my uncle's summer house, a combination vacation and
    summer job. Actually there were two uncles who had built only yards apart on my
    grandfather's land, part of the deal being that my mother got the apartment in the city. I
    hefted a crowbar and tried to look mean.<br>
    <br>
    -Hi there!<br>
    <br>
    I turned. She was tiny, dark and beautiful, dressed in a blue micro-miniskirt and a skimpy
    top, sitting on the porch of the other house, looking expectantly at me.<br>
    <br>
    -Deena?<br>
    <br>
    She jumped up, came over and gave me a hug. -Terry!<br>
    <br>
    The last time I saw her she was a skinny imp, twelve or so, with her half Thai features
    just short of breaking out in full bloom. She hadn't grown in height, but there were new
    curves around her hips and more flesh on her arms and legs. The minimal black skirt rode
    low, but still couldn't quite hide glimpses of white when she moved. The small lumps under
    her top showed tiny nipples through the fabric. I knew she was twenty-two, but she didn't
    look it.<br>
    <br>
    -Well, cousin, school's out, right?<br>
    <br>
    -Finally. So here I am, back to nature for two lovely months. She smiled and spread her
    arms: -Just the trees and me. And you.<br>
    <br>
    I explained my mission. I remembered her fondness for the place, when other
    twelve-year-olds would dream of stardom, the big city and expensive shoes. She would take
    long walks, climb trees, and run around with as little on as possible. Not an
    exhibitionist, a natural. She sat down, arms hugging her knees, white panties showing, and
    smiled at me. I also remembered our mutual liking, despite a four-year difference in age.
    I recalled a soft kiss on my cheek and the lightness of her body on my lap in the darkness
    as Uncle David told ghost stories.<br>
    <br>
    Ten years. It could have been last week. I put the crowbar aside and went to fetch a
    couple of beers. We sat cross-legged on the grass, updating events. Emptying the can she
    rose, stretched in a feline way, skirt lifting. Her full black hair reached her tiny waist
    when she lifted her face. Then she looked down at me.<br>
    <br>
    -Just have to water the grass.<br>
    <br>
    She pulled down her panties and sank to her haunches, still with her eyes on me. Pulled
    up, smiled, and sat down again.<br>
    <br>
    She used to do that. Squat whenever she had to go, wherever she happened to be, making
    nothing of it. I admired that naturalness in her, being rather shy myself.<br>
    <br>
    We talked a bit before I decided to start working, promising her to take breaks often. She
    could make iced tea, or something?<br>
    <br>
    This could be a very satisfying job.<br>
    <br>
    I was well into tearing down the old terrace when Deena appeared, carrying a tray. She
    called me down, offering me iced tea and cold Pepsi. We sat on the grass, enjoying the
    sun, reminiscing. She had tucked her legs under her, skirt barely covering her groin.
    Without interrupting the conversation she spread her legs slightly and I heard a hissing
    sound. Looking down I saw the golden stream trickle from her panties.<br>
    <br>
    She saw my stare. -Oops, she smiled. -Guess I'm too used to doing that out here. That's
    freedom for me. Going whenever I need. Do you mind?<br>
    <br>
    -Not at all. It's cute.<br>
    <br>
    -Waking up in the morning. Going out on the porch, naked. Letting go right there- back to
    nature, right?<br>
    <br>
    I smiled at her. -Feel free around me. Brightens up my day, that.<br>
    <br>
    She grinned back. -Keep working, Terry. Talk to you later.<br>
    <br>
    I looked at her sweet butt under the swinging skirt as she walked off, thinking about a
    wet stain on white cotton.<br>
    <br>
    I decided to stop for the night, having removed most of the old planks. I changed into
    cutoffs and brought a beer to the front steps. Deena appeared only minutes later, hips
    swaying, wearing a long knit dress that hugged every curve on her exquisite body. She
    carried a bottle of white wine and two glasses, and sat down beside me.<br>
    <br>
    -So, she said, -tell me all. Any resident girlfriends?<br>
    <br>
    -None.<br>
    <br>
    -Any getting-to-move-in-soon girlfriends, then?<br>
    <br>
    -None on that, too. You?<br>
    <br>
    -Girlfriends?<br>
    <br>
    -You know what I mean.<br>
    <br>
    She laughed. -Single, and loving every second of it.<br>
    <br>
    Deena hugged her knees. The dress was so tight it didn't even wrinkle, and she wore panty
    shorts underneath. -Okay, just got disentangled. End of story.<br>
    <br>
    I downed my beer and accepted wine. Holding the glass kept me from putting an arm around
    her.<br>
    <br>
    She looked at me, took the glass from my hand, and snuggled in under my arm.<br>
    <br>
    -Just hold me like that, will you.<br>
    <br>
    I felt the heat from her body, and a soft feminine smell. We sat in silence for a while,
    sipping wine. Then she sighed. -I could sit here forever. If only I didn't have to pee.<br>
    <br>
    She made no sign of wanting to get up, so I squeezed her shoulder and thought improper
    thoughts. Minutes passed. Then she lifted her head from my shoulder.<br>
    <br>
    -Well. When a girl's got to go... She went down onto the grass, wriggled her dress up, and
    pulled her panties down before squatting. When finished she rose, pulled up and smoothed
    down her dress. -Whew, she said. -That felt good.<br>
    <br>
    I wasn't used to girls who were so open about it. I had to adjust myself to keep from
    escaping my cutoffs. She sat down again and poured more wine.<br>
    <br>
    After some mutual updating on family and history, she suggested a walk. We followed the
    road along the lake, and suddenly I felt a small hand touch mine. I looked at the tiny
    woman beside me, with her black hair and beautiful brown eyes, and could have melted on
    the spot.<br>
    <br>
    Turning down the path to the water she walked in front of me. I caressed her butt with my
    eyes, watching the fabric move over the outline of the panty shorts. I wondered what color
    she was wearing.<br>
    <br>
    Down by the shore she turned to me. -Fancy a swim?<br>
    <br>
    -Okay, I said, unbuttoning my cutoffs.<br>
    <br>
    Deena pulled her dress up over her head. Red- bright red panties. Flat belly and small
    breasts, pointed nipples.<br>
    <br>
    She dipped her toes: -Ow!<br>
    <br>
    -Cold?<br>
    <br>
    -Better add some hot water. She squatted; facing me, butt two inches above the surface,
    and peed through her panties. -There. Now I have to go in.<br>
    <br>
    She waded to her knees, hugging herself, shivering. My eyes were glued to the wet stain
    between her legs. She turned. -On second thoughts...<br>
    <br>
    -We'll come back another day, when the sun is still up, I said, trying to button my
    shorts.<br>
    <br>
    She laughed. -I'm such a pussy. And I've peed my panties again.<br>
    <br>
    -Cute, I said.<br>
    <br>
    She smiled at me and put her dress on, took my hand, and we walked back.<br>
    <br>
    Then she said goodnight and went in.<br>
    <br>
    The next morning I was up early. After a couple of hours her door opened, and she emerged,
    dressed in an oversize t-shirt. She greeted me, stretched her arms towards the sun, spread
    her feet and peed standing up. She went back in, and came out minutes later wearing red
    leggings and a tiny halter-top, carrying a tray. Breakfast for two. We sat cross-legged on
    the grass, and there was nowhere to look but at her bare belly and the tight cotton
    beneath it.<br>
    <br>
    Of course we talked, but my mind was on her lovely shapes. There was a penny-sized dark
    spot between her legs, it could have been from the moisture in the grass, or maybe not. We
    finished eating, and she carried the tray back to the house. I seriously believe she had
    nothing under her leggings.<br>
    <br>
    Later she came out to tan herself. It was the smallest bikini I had ever seen-three tiny
    black triangles on thin strings barely covering nipples and pubic hair, if there was any.
    It didn't look like it. She spread out a big towel and arranged books, magazines and
    beverages around her.<br>
    <br>
    And they were expecting me to work in these circumstances?<br>
    <br>
    I rearranged my plans, deciding to work on the other side so as to have a better view of
    her. She laid on her belly reading, with her perfect butt to the sun, one string circling
    her hips and another disappearing down the crack. Perched on her elbows her back was
    arched, and her hair was tied in two ponytails to be out of the way.<br>
    <br>
    Ten pages on she put the book down and turned on her back. The unnecessary bikini top made
    her look even more undressed. She put her hand on her belly. Then moved it slowly, in
    small circles. Her other hand covered one small breast. The circles moved downwards, until
    her fingertips rested on top of the black Lycra covering her mound. She spread her legs
    slightly, and her hand slipped further down. One finger found the beginning of her slit,
    pressing the fabric against her sensitive spot. She pinched her nipple as her hand covered
    her crotch, pressing rhythmically on her openings. A mewing sound escaped her as her hips
    rose and her hand clenched.<br>
    <br>
    She lay still, getting her breath back. Then she pushed the Lycra to one side and a golden
    stream rose from her sex. Finished, she adjusted her bikini bottom and turned on her belly
    again.<br>
    <br>
    I walked around the house to be alone.<br>
    <br>
    I had barely done what I had to do before she called me.<br>
    <br>
    -I need some groceries. Want to come?<br>
    <br>
    -Sure!<br>
    <br>
    She had put on a minimal denim skirt and pink t-shirt. We got in her car, a battered
    Toyota. There was a towel on the floor in front of the passenger seat, and she quickly
    tossed it in the back. She drove sitting with legs apart, giving me a good view of her
    pink panties.<br>
    <br>
    -What's with the towel, I asked.<br>
    <br>
    -If it's a long drive, I sit on it, she replied.<br>
    <br>
    -For comfort?<br>
    <br>
    She cast a glance at me. -Don't pretend. In case I'm held up in traffic, of course.<br>
    <br>
    -Then you just...<br>
    <br>
    -Let go. Do I shock you?<br>
    <br>
    -You turn me on, I said. -I would love to see that.<br>
    <br>
    She put a hand on my thigh. -Buy me a soda or two, and we'll see what happens.<br>
    <br>
    We made our purchases and walked down the short street to the café. I ordered iced tea
    and water, and we sipped, watching the locals. We even had another round before we left.
    Deena walked with small steps, soft thighs together, obviously in need of a pee. She
    smiled as she wriggled into the seat, hand touching her belly:<br>
    <br>
    -I really have to go.<br>
    <br>
    -Drive slowly, I said.<br>
    <br>
    She chose a longer way home. Now she had to keep her knees together, and occasionally a
    hand left the wheel to rest in her lap. She bit her lip and concentrated, wriggling in the
    seat.<br>
    <br>
    -I have to pee, she said. -Really have to pee. She checked the mirror and slowed down
    before reaching for the towel. -Almost wetting myself, she moaned as she struggled to fold
    the towel and place it under her butt, still cruising slowly.<br>
    <br>
    -I can't hold it, she whispered, knees trembling. She spread her legs, and I stared as she
    began wetting her panties and skirt, staining the towel. -I'm peeing!<br>
    <br>
    She managed to stop the flood, and drove on. There was a soft smell of girl pee in the
    car. Minutes later she pulled over. -I'm still bursting, she said. -Should I just do it?<br>
    <br>
    -Let go, I said.<br>
    <br>
    She looked down in her lap, pulled up the hem of the skirt and watched herself as she let
    loose, totally soaking the towel. Relieved, she smoothed down the skirt and drove on home.<br>
    <br>
    I watched her as she walked away from the car, carrying groceries. She reached up under
    the wet crescent to pull her soaked panties out of her butt crack.<br>
    <br>
    Through the lace curtains I could see Deena in her room- a small dark outline still
    wearing the miniskirt. She moved about, occasionally drinking from a soda or something.
    She looked in her closet, probably choosing new garments. There was probably a mirror on
    the wall perpendicular to the window, as she stood still staring at something. She made a
    beautiful silhouette, her long thick hair, the small plums on her chest, the arc of her
    back accentuating her tiny belly and rounded butt.<br>
    <br>
    She pulled her t-shirt over her head. Stroked her breasts, cupped them. Stepped out of her
    skirt, wriggled her panties down. She patted her belly, and then turned around to look at
    her own profile, back to me. Incredibly slim waist. Slowly she pulled a garment over her
    head; it must have been very tight fitting, as it didn't change her profile. She pulled on
    a pair of pants, wriggling her hips to fit them in. Suddenly she turned and pulled the
    curtains away, laughing at me. -Nice view, Terry?<br>
    <br>
    -Who needs a TV?<br>
    <br>
    -Be right with you.<br>
    <br>
    She stepped up to me carrying a six-pack. The t-shirt was white with some cartoon figure
    on the front. The jeans, barely covering her pubic mound, were faded light blue and were
    laced up in front. No pockets. She sat beside me, popping a beer.<br>
    <br>
    I pointed at the grinning face on the t-shirt. -Still shopping in the children's
    department?<br>
    <br>
    -Sure. You should see my Minnie Mouse panty collection.<br>
    <br>
    -You're not wearing any now, I believe.<br>
    <br>
    -Voyeur!<br>
    <br>
    -Exhibitionist!<br>
    <br>
    -Perfect couple, right?<br>
    <br>
    Her eyes laughed at me. She was my cousin, that made it OK, didn't it? I smiled and drank
    beer.<br>
    <br>
    I had to relieve myself. I stepped down, finding no need for seclusion, and unbuttoned.
    She looked at me, and then rose, came up behind me, and took matters into her own hands,
    so to speak. I felt myself grow in her small hand as she watered the bushes. She put me
    back in - not without difficulty - and buttoned up. -You forgot to shake, I said.<br>
    <br>
    She laughed. -Next time. Then she began to unlace her jeans.<br>
    <br>
    -Wait, I said. -You'll probably need help with that.<br>
    <br>
    I stood behind her, bending down to untie the knot. Straining the fabric I pulled her
    jeans down to mid-thigh, and on sudden impulse I grabbed her behind her knees and lifted
    her. She let it flow, relaxing in my arms.<br>
    <br>
    I helped her lace up again, and she stretched to give me a quick kiss. Time for more beer.<br>
    <br>
    The night grew chilly. She moved one step below me and leaned back between my legs,
    putting my arms around her. I felt a small breast, but she didn't move my arm.<br>
    <br>
    -Did you know I had a big crush on you, back then?<br>
    <br>
    -Really?<br>
    <br>
    -Oh yes. I remember watching you, getting all kinds of strange feelings in my pussy. I
    even spied on you when you peed, pulling down my shorts, trying hard to do the same. I
    wanted to hold you while you did it.<br>
    <br>
    -Now you have.<br>
    <br>
    -But then I could only imagine. I even tried peeing standing up, but most of it soaked my
    shorts. Actually, that didn't feel so bad, so I started wetting myself frequently. When
    nobody would find out. I wore a dress with nothing under so I could sit on the grass and
    do it. Sneak my hand under my skirt and hold myself. Rub a little. Fondle my little thing
    down there until my body shivered and I had to pee again.<br>
    <br>
    Deena had one hand between her legs. I stroked her belly, tracing the line above her
    waistband. My other hand cupped her breast.<br>
    <br>
    -I stopped when my breasts grew and I got my period. Thinking that this wetting stuff was
    for kids only. But a couple of years ago I sat out here, alone, drinking iced tea, wearing
    leggings, thinking back. Remembering the feeling. I had to pee, and was feeling a little
    horny, so I decided to try, just a little. Letting out a few drops. I felt my pussy and
    got really turned on by the warm wetness. Let go a little more. Drank more tea. Finally I
    was totally bursting, had to hold on with both hands. Thought why not, so I just spread my
    legs and peed myself. Lovely. Since then... I've been hooked. Terry, I have to pee again.<br>
    <br>
    I slid my hand down to her waistband. She held her breath to let me in. I held her totally
    hairless pussy, and she spread her legs to help my finger slide into her. As I touched her
    clit she moaned, wriggled, and peed a small squirt. I kept stroking, feeling my hand get
    wetter with every movement.<br>
    <br>
    -You're wetting your jeans, Deena, I said.<br>
    <br>
    -I can't hold it! She wriggled out of my arms and stood in front of me, hips pushed
    forward, palm-sized pee stain between her legs. -It's coming!<br>
    <br>
    The pee burst from her crotch, running down her legs, darkening the pale blue denim. I
    rose, and she wrapped her arms and legs around me, still peeing. I held her cute little
    butt, feeling the warm liquid pouring over my hands. We sank down to the ground,
    undressing each other, streams of pee still spurting from her. We joined. Lying on the
    grass, beautiful Deena in my arms, I knew this job would take a long, long time.<br>
    <br>
    I felt something hot soak my hand. I moved my fingers.<br>
