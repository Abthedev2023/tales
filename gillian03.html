    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The MD80 touched down at LaGuardia
    airport, fifteen minutes late. Rebekah was, as usual, stuck in the back half of the plane
    in 20A, waiting with her body half in the aisle, half in the seats for the passengers in
    front of her to get off the arriving plane. The flight hadn't been too bad, a couple of
    hours in the air, no major problems. Rebekah wasn't terribly fond of flying, but nothing
    that a few drinks at the bar wouldn't help. After a few minutes of waiting, she got off
    the plane and walked up the airway to the gate area. She'd been to NY before, but usually
    had driven; flying in was something new. She was surprised by how small the airport was
    compared to the one back home. It was good to be away, she thought. Her recent marriage
    ending in divorce recently, her job going badly, and her life being in general chaos
    really made her decide on a quick weekend getaway. At 26 years old, she thought she should
    have been through all the bad luck by now, but the past few months were anything but fun.
    So she decided to take off for NYC, spend a weekend taking dance classes at one of the
    famous NYC studios and maybe catch a show if she could get a cheap last minute seat at the
    TKTS booth. Anything to get her mind of her failed marriage and job stress, which were
    depressing her to no end. BUMP. &quot;Excuse ME,&quot; the lady said when Rebekah
    accidentally walked into her, not paying attention too well as her mind drifted as she
    walked down past the gates. First stop, she thought, the bathroom. The two beers she had
    before the flight along with the 3 cups of coffee she drank during the flight were
    beginning to make their presence known. Rebekah hated airplane bathrooms, so while she had
    realized the growing fullness of her bladder, she didn't have to go THAT badly and had
    held her pee in during the flight. But now, with her standing up and walking about, she
    noticed the twinges of pressure from her bladder. Ahh. The ladies room, she thought,
    heading over to the door. Walking into the small bathroom, she noticed a line of other
    passengers waiting for the stalls. Looking around, Rebekah sighed and thought to herself
    that she'd just wait until she got to her hotel in Manhattan. While she certainly noticed
    her bladder, she was far from desperate, and surely, she thought, the taxi ride couldn't
    be that far into the city. Sighing, she picked up her overnight bag from the floor and
    headed out and back to the terminal, searching for the ground transportation. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She headed to the taxi stand, and
    waited in the warm sun for the next cab. A few minutes pass, and Rebekah inwardly wonders
    if maybe she shouldn't have waited for the bathroom as she noticed much more acutely how
    bad she has to pee. The taxi pulled up, Rebekah climbed into the backseat and gave her
    destination to the driver and they head off. As the cab sped along the busy thoroughfares,
    she mindlessly stared out of the window, wishing the cab's air conditioning worked better
    than it did. She rummaged through her dance bag and pulled out a liter of bottled water
    and starts to sip, staring out the cabs window at the dirty cityscape. &quot;How far is it
    to the theater district sir?&quot; She asks the cabbie, wondering if he speaks English.
    &quot;A little less than an hour miss, depending on the traffic over the Triborough
    Bridge, with no problems,&quot; mumbles the cabbie in an accent Rebekah couldn't identify.
    &quot;One hour,&quot; Rebekah thought silently, suddenly noticing her bladder's growing
    fullness. One hour until she could check into her hotel and relieve the morning's pee that
    was still building inside her. &quot;Well, nothing I can do about it now, should have gone
    to the bathroom when I had the chance&quot;, Rebekah thought to herself, pressing her legs
    together unconsciously to help stem the growing pressure in her abdomen. Still in a daze,
    she drank more water, now almost half way through the liter bottle, not thinking, as she
    would later admit to me when she told the story, how it was adding to her discomfort as
    the minutes went by. The cab sped along the highway. The mid day sun streamed through the
    window on Rebekahs long blond hair and fair skin. The cabbie glanced in his rearview
    mirror at her, mentally evaluating her as being quite pretty if maybe a few pounds heavier
    than he'd like. What size would she be, he thought, maybe a 7 or 9?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Either way, the cabbie thought, she looks pretty
    good in those tight faded blue jeans and that tank top. Was she even wearing a bra, he
    wondered? No, doesn't look like it, and she wasn't one of those ice skater types he
    ferried in the other week. This girl had some boobs. Not overly huge, but definitely
    looking good with her nipples erect through her yellow top too. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He giggled silently. The cabby's
    fantasies were stopped by the sudden traffic jam as they approached the bridge. Figures,
    he thought. Always have to sit here for a while, as he put the transmission in neutral.
    The sudden stop jolted Rebekah out of her daydreaming. She looked around, nothing but cars
    on both sides. Nobody moving. They were stuck in a mid day traffic jam on the bridge.
    &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked the driver. &quot;Traffic. Every day they work on the
    bridge and it slows down. Shouldn't be too long miss,&quot; the driver replied. Rebekah
    took it all in. Suddenly alert after daydreaming and staring in space the past 15 minutes,
    she suddenly realized how badly she had to use the bathroom. She looked at her watch. It
    had been 5 hours since she used the bathroom, and since then a few beers, some coffee, and
    that water for breakfast and the water she was drinking suddenly wanted out.
    &quot;Great&quot;, she thought silently. &quot;Why didn't I pee when I had a chance? Now
    I've got to sit here with my legs pressed together in this stupid traffic jam.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rebekah pressed her thighs tighter together. She
    really had to urinate now. Badly. Her bladder's fullness was apparent by the way her tight
    jeans were now too snug. The stinging sensation of pressure was starting to be noticeable,
    signaling her bladder's urgent desire to void, and soon. &quot;How long do you think this
    will be?&quot; Rebekah asked, her hands shooting down between her legs and against her
    crotch of her jeans, trying to reduce the urgent sensations she was experiencing.
    &quot;Depends. Maybe 20 minutes? Hey, at least we are moving now,&quot; the driver
    responded. Moving, but at maybe 2-3 mph every minute. Rebekah tried to look off into the
    distance, anything to take her mind off her throbbing bladder. She had to pee so badly;
    she normally would have immediately stopped whatever she was doing to go relieve herself,
    even if that meant leaving a movie midway or excusing herself from bible study. She really
    had to go, and as the minutes wore on, stuck on the bridge, Rebekah began to get worried.
    The passing minutes wore like eternity as the cab inched forward. She was in distress now,
    trying to hold her impending flood from releasing. The pressure in her bladder was strong
    now, and that stinging sensation of pressure overcame her body at times, as her bladder
    continued to send distress signals to the poor blond girl desperately stuck in traffic on
    the bridge. Rebekah hoped she could make it without wetting herself. That was her biggest
    fear. Too many times she had driven somewhere and almost wet herself because she had held
    on to the last minute. And right now, the pain and pressure in her body from her swollen
    throbbing bladder was greater than anything she had felt before. Finally the cab started
    moving. Rebekah bit her lip and let loose a small sigh of relief, thankful to at least be
    moving, even if slowly. Anything to help her get to a bathroom in time. As they crawled
    along, Rebekah couldn't take her mind off her screaming bladder. She longed just to be
    able to pull down her jeans and underwear and just pee for days. She had never had to go
    the bathroom this badly before, and the pressure and discomfort was almost more than she
    could bear. If just somehow she could just pee a little so it didn't hurt so bad, but
    there was nowhere to go. She was stuck in a cab in mid-day traffic on the verge of peeing
    in her jeans and she knew it. &quot;Just hold on, it can't be much longer,&quot; she
    thought to herself as she shoved her left hand in between her thighs and pressed hard
    against her crotch. She was starting to squirm now, having problems sitting still, and the
    cabbie looked in his mirror and wondered what was up with his passenger until it dawned on
    him, looking at the way she was sitting knees pressed together, hands shoved between her
    thighs pressing on her crotch, fidgeting in the seat, that it looked like she really
    needed to use the bathroom. Rebekah's nipples were fully erect, not from sexual excitement
    but from the tenseness and awareness of her body while she dealt with her swollen bladders
    urge to void into her clothing. A few more miles. All the water was really catching up,
    and just when Rebekah thought she might have a handle on it for a few more minutes, the
    pressure increased. Rebekah gasped inwardly suddenly when she felt a sudden sharp wave of
    pressure overcome her, seemingly like the oceans of pee trapped in her bladder wanted to
    come out, and now. The pain during that wave was intense, causing her to lose all
    concentration on anything except for her extreme need for relief. She tightened every
    muscle in her body and held on while her bladder contracted, silently praying she could
    somehow manage until she got to the hotel and then quickly find a bathroom. A few more
    miles to go. Rebekah started to really worry. She couldn't sit still, her poor tortured
    body tense as she squirmed in total desperation from having to go to the bathroom so bad,
    she felt like she would flood her jeans any minute. &quot;Please, oh Please, don't make me
    wet my pants God,&quot; she prayed. The last time she had an accident was when she was 14
    in gym class, and she didn't want to have one now. Finally they arrived in the midtown
    area. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Rebekah was squirming, beads of
    sweat on her forehead, hands jammed into her crotch, trying to do anything that would ease
    some of the pressure. A few more blocks to go, she thought. SHRIEK! Suddenly the cabbie
    locked up the brakes to avoid a wayward bus, the cab skidding to a stop in the middle of
    the road. Rebekah's hands instinctively went up to keep her from hitting the seat in front
    of her, but her body flung forward against her seatbelt. Just then a huge wave of pressure
    overtook the poor girl and she rapidly flung both hands back into her crotch, but the
    sudden movement caused her to momentarily lose control and as the pressure overcame her,
    she felt her crotch muscles loosen just slightly and she peed a small spurt into her
    underwear before she managed to get it under control. 'OH God,&quot; Rebekah cursed out
    loud, thrusting her hands deeper into her crotch. She felt the second stream of pee escape
    and was petrified. She was slowly losing control, and tried to hold it in. Just a few more
    blocks. Just a few more blocks, she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Shaking uncontrollably, her knees
    shivering from the intense pain of her bladder, Rebekah relaxed her thighs and looked down
    at her crotch, hoping none of her pee would show. Unfortunately, the sudden unexpected
    spurt had darkened the light faded blue jean in a somewhat obvious wet spot maybe an inch
    or two around. Rebekah tried wiping it, hoping it would dry before she had to go to the
    hotel lobby, and secretly hoping nobody would realize how incredibly badly she needed to
    go to the bathroom. She leaned forward, pressing her legs back together, wishing the
    traffic light would change. One more block, and she'd be at the hotel, where she could
    find relief before she lost control and wet her pants right here. The pain grew with every
    second. Another wave overtook her; Rebekahs will was barely enough to hang on. She wanted
    to pee SO badly, it hurt SO much to hold it in, but she was resolved to not wet her pants.
    The cab finally came to the front of the hotel. Rebekah sighed as the cabbie told her the
    fare and she rummaged through her dance bag, coming up with the cash. She could hardly sit
    still, her dance bag in between her legs with the passenger side rear door open, and as
    she paid the driver, she felt another wave of pressure overtake her. She almost controlled
    it, but another small slip of hot pee escaped the poor girl's clenched crotch lips, and
    her wet spot grew. The cabbie looked over at her and instantly noticed the wet mark on her
    jeans and looked back at the seat to see if she had wet the seat any. Thankfully, he
    thought, she hadn't. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A shame, the cabbie thought, this
    one was cute, nice tits with her nipples fully erect through her blouse and desperate to
    pee. Rebekah hurriedly stood up, and headed towards the lobby door. As she walked,
    suddenly the weight of her pee became obvious. Standing up straight somehow made her urge
    to urinate twice as strong. She paused for a minute, hands quickly shooting towards her
    drying crotch, her lungs gasping for air as another violent wave of pain overtook her. The
    stinging sensation, the pressure, and the dizziness all overcame her for a second, and she
    couldn't completely hold back. Her legs clenched together, knock-kneed and her torso half
    bent over, a tear sprang to her eye as her distended bladder rebelled and a small jet of
    hot pee flooded into her tight clothing. &quot;OH GOD, NO, NOO&quot;, Rebekah cried
    loudly, to nobody in particular. She clenched her muscles tight, realizing now that the
    last spurt had caused a slight damp area on her right inner thigh, which would be obvious
    to anyone looking at her what was happening. She tried to put her bag in front of her to
    block the view, and rushed into the lobby, her bladder screaming to continue its release
    against her every will to hold her pee inside. She stood in line, wishing the people in
    front of her would hurry up. Her eyes scanned the lobby for a bathroom. Nothing. She
    couldn't stand still, hopping back and forth; her legs still pressed together, her hand in
    between her legs and the other on her bag. Another wave. Tears sprang to her eyes as her
    bladder released ever so slightly again. She felt the hot pee rush out for just a fraction
    of a second before summing her every will to hold back the urge. The pee however now
    dampened her underwear and she felt a small trickle run down her right thigh, on the
    inside. She was on the verge of completely wetting her pants, and she knew she had to find
    a bathroom NOW or it was going to be over. She awkwardly walked over to the line formed in
    front of the check in desk, hoping two thoughts: one, that nobody saw the wet marks on her
    jeans and two, that she could check in before the next wave overcame her. She wasn't sure
    she could hold back the burning pressure in her bladder any longer. The line moved slowly.
    Only one clerk on duty. Rebekahs breathing was short and quick, her body tense, her nerves
    shot. She had to pee so badly, and was stuck waiting for the one clerk to get through the
    line of people. Tears came to her eyes as she felt another wave start to swell inside of
    her, her bladder sending yet another distress signal desiring release. Crying, Rebekah
    tried to hold it, and almost managed, but at the last minute the pain was so great she
    couldn't quite control it, and another jet of pee escaped her clenched lips, the sudden
    warmth dampening her jeans between her legs. She felt the inside of her left leg go damp,
    and managed to clamp the pee stream off before she completely lost control, her muscles
    tightening as she tried to prevent any further embarrassment. She glimpsed down at her
    legs quickly to see the damage. Sure enough, a moderate size wet mark was visible on her
    left inner thigh, and the previous wetness on her right thigh was noticeable too.
    &quot;Please, please, please&quot;, she thought to herself, &quot;Just let me get a room
    so I can pee. Just don't let me pee right here, please let me hold it just a few more
    minutes&quot;. Rebekah was next, and wiped the tears from her eyes as she tried to walk in
    a controlled manner to the counter, her bladder completely at it's maximum holding
    capacity and a small wave of pressure beginning to build up inside of her. &quot;Yes
    Ma'am&quot;, the clerk acknowledged her. &quot;I. I'm sorry. I've got a room
    reservation&quot;, Rebekah stammered, her words jumbling as she felt the next wave of
    pressure overtake her tortured body. She clenched her legs tight together behind the
    counter, pressing with every muscle, trying to keep her pee inside for a few more minutes.
    &quot;Hmm. I don't have a reservation under that name, Ma'am,&quot; the clerk replied.
    Rebekah's eyes went white with fright. &quot;What? I reserved it last Thursday!&quot; She
    replied in panic, her bladder then screaming with relief. The pressure increased. Rebekah
    couldn't control herself, and tears sprang to her eyes again and she felt a slow trickle
    of pee escape from her crotch. All of her concentration was in trying to stop the flow,
    but her tormented bladder battled and she peed a slow trickle of warm pee into her blue
    jeans for about 2 seconds before she regained control. Her breathing became even quicker,
    tears obvious in her eyes, and her heart racing as her desperation reached maximum
    intensity. She felt the pee warmth flow down her clenched legs, and glancing down, she
    noticed the twin streams of wetness on her jeans where her legs were clenched together.
    She was slowly wetting herself, and these idiots had lost her room reservation!
    &quot;Please, Please, I really need a room. It's an emergency,&quot; Rebekah pleaded with
    the clerk. &quot;I'm sorry Ma'am, but the hotel is completely full. A convention
    overbooked. I'm afraid we have no record of your reservation. Perhaps you have a
    confirmation number?&quot; the clerk replied. Rebekah felt another wave overtake her body.
    She started to cry and stammer. She reached into her purse, fumbled around, found the slip
    of paper with the number scribbled on it, and was desperately hopping back and forth,
    feeling her bladder about to empty into her already dampened jeans. &quot;Hereherre,
    here's the nummbber&quot;, Rebekah muttered, suddenly trying to battle a sharp pain which
    caused her to involuntarily again lose control. A three second jet of pee emptied into her
    damp blue jeans, now fully soaking her crotch. She felt her underwear flood with the
    wetness and cling to her private parts as she struggled trying to stop the flow. &quot;I'm
    sorry Ma'am, but I don't show any record of this reservation in our computer. Perhaps you
    have the wrong hotel?&quot; the clerk replied. &quot;But pleaseppplease. I I II need to
    use a bathroom please can you just give me a room I'm starting to wet my pants!&quot;
    Rebekah, now crying, stammered back to the clerk as another wave overtook the poor blond
    as she started to again pee a small stream into her clothing. &quot;Oh god. Noooooo.
    Please, please I have to go to the bathroom,&quot; she wailed, unable momentarily to stop
    her peeing. Pee ran down both legs to her shoes. A few droplets dropped onto the shag
    carpet of the hotel floor. Tears were streaming down her face; sweat beads on her high
    forehead, her long blond hair sweaty and straggly from the stress and torture this poor
    girl was enduring. &quot;Well, I'm sorry Ma'am. We don't have bathrooms in the lobby and
    we don't have a room. Please step aside and let the next person in line forward&quot;
    tersely replied the clerk. &quot;Oh noo. Pleaseplease can I use the employee bathroom
    anything. Please don't let me have an accident heeere,&quot; Rebekah begged, her voice
    trailing off as her bladders intensity increased yet again. She burst into tears, the pain
    beyond her control. The pressure in her bladder and the weakening of her crotch muscles
    left her uncontrollably peeing in small spurts. Jet after jet started to come out against
    the poor girls will. She felt her underwear flood and the pee stream out of her tortured
    body, and crying, turned around, walked to the middle of the lobby, looking in vain for
    the bathroom that wasn't there, and slowly lost control of her bodily functions. &quot;Oh
    god oh GODDD oh NOOOOO&quot; she wailed, tormented by the pain in her abdomen as she lost
    all control. Her pee exploded out of her clenched lips, thrashing through the cotton
    underwear and soaking her jeans. Flood after flood of pee streamed down her jeans like
    waterfalls, the river of pee obvious to anyone looking. The lights reflected off the
    flowing moisture streaming down the insides and backs of her legs as she completely wet
    her pants in the lobby. She sheepishly walked outside, totally unsure of what to do. She
    leaned against he wall of the building, and crouched down. Pee again exploded into her
    jeans, streaming in torrents through her soaked clothing and dripping down between her
    crouched body onto the sidewalk, streams of pee forming along the cement and a huge puddle
    forming. Rebekah hadn't wet her pants as an adult and the humiliation, the embarrassment;
    the utter pain from her desperation was too much to bear. She was crying uncontrollably,
    her face in her hands, and she sagged down to where she sat on the ground, her soaked
    jeans sitting in her pee puddle, her knees up, her wet jeans crotch in plain sight as her
    legs were apart, and she emptied the rest of her bladder into her clothing in shame on the
    street, people walking by and staring at the large stream of pee flowing from the poor
    girls soaking wet crotch of her jeans. Alone in New York City, no hotel room and totally
    soaking wet from the most humiliating pee accident, Rebekah's life was in shambles. Being
    recently divorced by the husband she loved so much, being alone and now totally soaked
    with nowhere to change was beyond her ability to cope and she had a nervous breakdown,
    crying and shaking uncontrollably as she sat in a puddle of her wet pee on the city
    sidewalk. Nobody stopped to help, but many people stared at the huge puddle between the
    blond girls soaked legs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    all the way to the dance studio (too embarrassed to take a taxi, she said) where she had
    intended to take class and they offered to let her use the shower to clean up and change.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The embarrassment of having to walk into the
    studio with fully soaked jeans was almost as embarrassing as peeing her pants in the hotel
    lobby. Worse yet was taking the dance class while having to listen to some of the students
    who had seen her entrance snicker as they joked about the blond girl who had peed herself
    on the street. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    confided in me that she has had problems ever since and because of the stress of her life
    that she has occasionally wet the bed, and has had problems holding her pee when she
    drives long distances and has wet herself a few other times, but not as embarrassing as
    this. She told me she had seen an urologist and a psychiatrist to deal with her
    incontinence and depression and had been feeling better but is still occasionally having
    accidents. I had hoped she would be interested in the sexual aspects of wetting, but for
    her it was completely a humiliating experience that she was almost too embarrassed to tell
    me. To this day she doesn't know how much I was excited about her story, and how excited I
    was a few months later when she had another accident, this time in my presence.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
