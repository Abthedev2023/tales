    Carpenter<br>
    </strong><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000"><strong>Note: This story contains
    Female Desperation and Accidental Wetting.</strong></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I work at a medium-sized
    IT-development firm where we develop large-scale applications for other firms. Doing an
    intake for a new assignment starts with a visit to the customer by a technician and an
    account manager. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I was still a novice I was told
    to join Mrs. Carpenter in such an intake trip. Mrs. Carpenter was one of the top sales
    executives, but most of the men thought about her as the woman who knew how to dress. She
    always wore suits with skirts that never ended at or below the knee. She always walked on
    spike-heeled pumps. In the company's cafeteria, I used to admire her muscular, yet very
    feminine legs with bulging, rock-hard calves, which she always crossed in an equally
    feminine manner. Not vulgar, but always showing lots of thigh in the process, always
    making you wonder if her panties would show. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At 39, she was still a beautiful
    woman with chestnut-brown, shoulder-long hair and hard-blue eyes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On the morning of the trip she
    entered my room with a cheerful &quot;good morning&quot; and &quot;shall we use my
    car?&quot; I answered positively. God, those legs. Her bright-red suit had an even shorter
    skirt than usual and even showed some cleavage. Her heels were so high, that I already
    admired her for coming this far on them. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a two-hour drive, we arrived
    at the new client. We started off with a rather big meeting. Then, after lunch,
    technicians and managers went their separate ways, the managers to talk about money,
    basically, and the technicians to talk about the design. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At the end of the afternoon, the
    managers joined us out of curiosity. Mrs. Carpenter pulled up a chair right next to me
    and, crossing her legs, gave me a heavenly close-up at her thighs and - hail white cotton
    panties. As she bent forward, she gave me a nice view down her cleavage. Soon after that,
    we were walking back to Mrs. Carpenters BMW in good spirits with her complimenting me on
    my input. As we drove off the parking lot Mrs. Carpenter mentioned that she might need to
    do a sanitary stop underway. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Traffic out of this customer's city
    was terrible. We were crawling through many multi-lane streets filled with cars. After
    some twenty minutes, Mrs. Carpenter sighed deeply and said: &quot;This traffic is awful
    and I need a toilet badly.&quot; I asked: &quot;Didn't you go before we left?&quot; The
    answer was honest and surprising: &quot;I didn't have to go too badly then. Besides, I
    prefer not to go in strange places.&quot; &quot;You mean that you haven't used a toilet
    all day?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked, trying to hide my
    excitement, thinking about bulging, throbbing bladders with liters of pee in them.
    &quot;Not since I left home.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    acknowledged, &quot;I usually make it through the day &quot; &quot;Wow! You must have a
    huge bladder!&quot; I exclaimed, hoping my hard-on wouldn't show. &quot;Maybe, but the
    capacity is almost used up now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About fifteen more minutes went by
    during which I closely watched her for signs, but she was still able to maintain her
    composure. Then, suddenly, she sighed deeply and said: &quot;This is terrible. My bladder
    is bursting at the seams and I have nowhere to go!&quot; Her body rocked back and forth
    and her buttocks squirmed in her seat. And so we went on. I became afraid of coming in my
    pants while she made more and more comments about how badly she needed a toilet. Every now
    and then, she stroked her thighs with her hands as if she encouraged her body to hold on.
    Finally, we were in a long row facing the last traffic light before the highway. She had
    totally lost the ability to sit still for longer than 20 seconds, squirming frantically in
    her seat, she made her skirt ride up to dangerous levels. With a hissing sigh through her
    teeth she opened her thighs a couple of inches and pressed her hand in her crotch for a
    few seconds. Then she removed it, squeezing her thighs shut and gasped: &quot;God, I'm so
    desperate! Do you see anything I could go to? I don't want to piss in the car!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Until then, her choice of words had
    been rather civilized, but the word 'piss' marked a moment of further loss of composure.
    The light turned green and we turned onto the highway. After shifting into the highest
    gear, her hand slid sideways in between her thighs, pressing into her crotch. I could see
    the full length of her thighs and the side of her hand pressing the seam of her pantyhose
    together with the cotton of her panties into her pussy. Then my eyes caught her face. Her
    eyes were filled with tears. The pain was easily readable in them. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Within a couple of miles, traffic
    came to a halt. Mrs. Carpenter totally freaked out: &quot;God no... Sssssssss... I don't
    want to piss in the car ... Sssssssss ... I'll piss in the car!&quot; She started doing a
    violent pee-dance sitting in her car seat. Her whole body squirmed while her ass was
    sliding up and down her seat. She stopped for a second to lift her ass an inch and pull
    her skirt up from under it. Then the squirming went on. Both her hands were in her crotch
    with her fingers massaging her pussy lips in small circles. &quot;What am I going to
    do?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gasped with a breaking voice. I
    saw people in cars around us look at her strangely but decided not to warn her about it.
    Slowly the traffic started moving forward again. &quot;There is a parking in a mile, but
    it has no facilities.&quot; I observed. She couldn't reply and looked as if she was
    fighting another wave that was trying to push its way past her sphincter. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I saw another tear rolling down her
    wet cheek. In a way, she looked incredibly sexy like this but on the other hand I felt
    deep sympathy for her. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Struggling, she made it to the
    parking, stopped the car and threw the door open. She swayed her legs outside the car and
    then paused for several seconds. She was obviously pulling all her strength together to
    stand up. Then she got up and started walking towards the bushes with small, hurried steps
    while pulling down her skirt. She nearly made it. Nearly. I just spotted the small stream
    running down her pantyhose when she froze and bent over folding both hands between her
    legs. This last wave was too much for her exhausted muscles. She slowly squatted down as I
    saw an increasing spray of pee coming out. For at least three minutes she sat there with
    this human waterfall splashing loudly on the grass soaking her shoes and legs. Even
    through the cotton and nylon, the stream was massive, thick and hard. The amount must have
    been enormous. Very slowly it came to a stop. She returned to the car, pulled a plastic
    shopping bag over her seat and continued the trip. After several minutes she broke the
    silence: &quot;What a relief, but I'm so embarrassed. Please don't tell anyone at the
    office!&quot; I promised to her that it would be our little secret. I never told anyone in
    the office. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sometimes, when we met later in the
    office, she would give me a big smile, cross her legs and do a small curtsey as if she
    were desperate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
