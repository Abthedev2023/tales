      color="#000000" face="Arial"><br>
    </font><br><br>A fantasy story, but based on a real person and 
      real events.<br><br>I had worked with Claire for about three years when 
      these events happened. She was a bubbly, outgoing character, very 
      flirtatious and always willing to share a dirty joke or two.We were never 
      more than work colleagues, friends I suppose, but certainly never 
      romantically involved.<br><br>It was the middle of a typical British summer and 
      the night of the office barbecue.Surprisingly, it wasn't raining, but the 
      promise of storms to come on the weather forecast didn't bode well.The 
      barbecue was always held in the large garden of a pub near to the offices, 
      and we basically took the place over for the evening.Plenty of food and 
      plenty of drink was had by all, but eventually it was time to head for 
      home.I had a fairly long walk to my home, but it was pleasant enough.Down 
      the hill into the town, through the main shopping area and then under the railway bridge, past 
      the station and into the estate where I lived.About four miles in all, 
      so it was going to take me the better part of an hour and a half.I made 
      sure that I used the little boy's room before I left the pub - the 
      queue for the ladies was quite spectacular by then.There were lots of 
      squirming women and I half considered waiting nearby for a little while 
      in case there were any "sightings", but I thought better of it as it 
      might have been a bit obvious, and I knew most of them quite well.By 
      the time I finally left I could hear thunder rumbling in the distance 
      so I had a fair idea I was going to get a soaking before I got back to 
      my little house.<br><br>As I set off I thought I could see Claire a hundred 
      or so yards ahead, so I hurried to catch her up.Claire lived some 
      distance away, and normally drove to work, but today she had come by 
      rail and was now hurrying to catch one of the last trains home.I asked 
      what time her train was, and she told me that she had about fifteen 
      minutes to get to the station before the last one left, and given that 
      we were still well over two miles from the station I couldn't see how 
      she was going to make it in time.<br><br>"With a bit of luck it'll be late", she said, "they 
      often are.I would have taken a taxi, but when I rang they said it would 
      be at least forty-five minutes.At least walking I'll have half a 
      chance".We hurried along the busy main road past closed shops and pubs, 
      but there were still plenty of people about and lots of traffic.Then 
      Claire said something that made my heart skip a beat.<br><br>"I wish I'd queued up for the loo before I left the 
      pub - I'm absolutely bursting for a wee".I said we would keep an eye open 
      for a pub, but it wasn't very likely as it was well after 11pm and as it 
      was a Tuesday night everywhere seemed to have shut.The station was in 
      sight in the distance, but we still had quite a long way to go, and Claire 
      seemed to be slowing down rather than hurrying.Then I realised that the 
      reason she was walking so slowly was because she had her knees jammed 
      together.I asked if she was OK and she said that she was absolutely 
      desperate.<br><br>"I've been drinking beer all evening, and I only 
      went to the loo once.I don't think my bladder has ever been this full - 
      it really starting to hurt now".<br>"I doubt we're going to find a pub open now", I 
      replied, "Is there a toilet on the train?"<br><br>"I 
      think so, yes.Don't worry too much", she said, "I'm going to have to go 
      behind a car or something soon anyway".I felt my cock stiffening in my 
      underwear and put my hand in my pocket to adjust it into a more 
      comfortable position.Just then the rain that had been threatening started 
      to fall, accompanied by more thunder in the distance.<br><br>"Oh great", said Claire, "as if things weren't bad 
      enough" then she stopped walking completely and gasped.<br><br>"Oh no - I'm sorry about this, 
      but I've got to stop a moment".She had her legs tightly crossed and was 
      squirming like mad, then she lifted up her short skirt, rammed her hand 
      between her legs and groaned, "I'm going to have to find somewhere to stop 
      - I'm just about wetting my knickers".I groaned - my cock was absolutely 
      throbbing now and drips of pre-cum were leaking out at the thought of the 
      desperate woman alongside me.<br> <br>"Are you OK?" she asked, "you look a bit flushed".I 
      confessed that the idea that she needed a wee was turning me on 
      something rotten, expecting her to be shocked, but instead she just 
      giggled, "Maybe I should just do it in my pants then".I asked her if 
      she had done that before, and she said that she did it quite a 
      lot."It's the main reason I wear skirts so much - it's much easier to 
      have a crafty pee in a skirt than trousers"<br><br>We managed to get moving again, and we were getting 
      near to the station now, but just as we thought she might be in luck 
      her train rumbled over the bridge and off into the darkness.<br><br>"Oh well, no rush now", said Claire, "but I really 
      do have to pee".We walked under the railway bridge and as we came out 
      on the other side she pulled me up a small alley that ran alongside the 
      railway.In the darkness, she put her hand on my cock and squeezed 
      gently.<br><br>"Very nice", she said, and pushed her hand down the 
      front of my trousers.I felt her cool fingers take hold of the end of my 
      cock and start to rub the foreskin up and down.It was heaven, but I 
      knew it couldn't last long - I was so turned on I was practically 
      cumming already.<br><br>"I thought you had to pee" I gasped.<br><br>"I am" she replied "I'm doing it in my knickers 
      now".I could hear her pee splashing on the ground and that was all it 
      took - my cock twitched in her hand and spat jet after jet of spunk 
      into my underwear.<br><br>"Good boy" she whispered as she carried on peeing 
      through her knickers onto the sodden ground.<br><br>She ended up staying the night at my place (on the 
      couch!) with her knickers and my undies sharing the 
      washer/dryer.<br>
