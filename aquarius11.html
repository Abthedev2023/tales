    <br>
    First she was stunned. Then unbelieving, turning into sad. Finally plain mad. The cheek of
    it all. Staying out all night, coming home in the morning with what was feeble excuses,
    before owning up to having spent the night at some tart's place. Not his words, that. He
    had slowly gotten to the point, which was that he intended to stay with this slut, and
    would she please pack her things and be gone, like, tomorrow?<o:p></o:p></font></span><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A year and a half of living
    together, and then, poof. All right. A year and a half of staying at his place, bringing
    mostly clothes and glass animals. He had resented the animals, but until now he had loved
    her clothes, especially the short and tight ones. Apparently what fit in the clothes could
    be exchanged at times.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fuck him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda drew a deep breath and took
    stock of the situation. She was twenty-three, dark blonde, with smallish breasts and a
    modern slim body. He was twenty-eight, boyishly charming, and a total asshole. Which she
    hadn't realized before now. Well, maybe at times. That time when...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda suddenly knew that this
    bitch was not the first. Woman's instinct, way too late. But wishful thinking was a very
    strong force. Brian, you prick.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All right. What to do? Tomorrow, he
    had said. No haste. She'd get some boxes when the shops opened, and Liz or somebody could
    drive her somewhere. Today she would enjoy the rage and fury. Like a woman scorned, she
    remembered some quote from school. You bet.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She decided to get drunk, on his
    favorite wine. In blue sweater and jeans she sat on the sofa, put her bare feet on the
    table (which he disliked), opened a bottle and switched on the TV. She didn't know what
    she was watching, but hearing voices was OK.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She went through several options.
    Gun? Too quick, and she couldn't get hold of one. Knife? She didn't like to see blood.
    Sabotage his car? She couldn't even open the bonnet. Strangle him slowly? She didn't want
    to touch him again, ever. Sell his furniture? He probably was insured against such things,
    just in case, you know.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda fetched a mug of water as
    well. Drunk was OK- slobbering was not. Fill up, girl. She enjoyed a rerun of the gun
    fantasy, reveling in the pleading eyes and the regret, which came way too late. Boom. She
    wondered if she could cancel his insurance from tomorrow, and smash the whole apartment.
    But the neighbors might notice. She laughed softly at the thought. Excuse me, Melinda?
    What are you doing? Oh, nothing. Just rearranging. Oh dear. Is this really to Mr. Martin's
    liking? Oh well, good thing she could still laugh about it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He had told her she didn't know the
    other tart. Well, she could spy on them, and maybe strangle her slowly, making him watch.
    Bet she was a dumb blonde with sexy stockings and a plastic skirt, big boobs and too much
    lipstick. Serve her right. No, him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda giggled. She had to pee. She
    remembered some guy on TV, when asked about plans for Saturday: Watch a stupid film, drink
    beer, piss my pants, and fall asleep on the couch.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She giggled again. Good idea. She
    drank another glass of water, spread her legs a bit, and concentrated. Christ, this was
    difficult. Too proper of an upbringing. She tried to relax, spreading her legs even more,
    looking down at her crotch. Running water. Fountains. She poured more water, and suddenly
    the sound set the flow coming. It ran from her pussy, soaking the seat of the sofa,
    dripping on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The flow stopped. She felt her wet
    crotch, surprised by a sudden arousal. -There, Brian, she said out loud, -I just pissed
    myself on your sofa. She moved aside so as not to sit in the puddle. She drank more wine,
    opening the second bottle, but going hard on the water as well. Soon she needed to go
    again. Okay, Mel, she told herself, there are other places. She left the bottle uncorked
    and went into the bedroom, feeling the wet on her butt. She took off her jeans and
    sweater, throwing them on the floor. She looked at herself in the mirror: The narrow
    waist, the slim hips, the white panties with the pee stain just visible.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Brian was such a prissy. After a
    year and a half he still locked the door when he went to the loo. Oops, sorry, the
    bathroom. Once they had disclosed their most embarrassing moments. Melinda had been caught
    by her father smoking a joint in her room. Brian's worst experience was wetting himself at
    six. Christ, at six!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda slipped under the blankets
    on his side. Was he ever going to be angry! She lay on her back, legs slightly apart,
    stroking her belly. The warmth and the touch made it easier to let the pee flow freely.
    She lifted her legs, pressing the blankets to her pussy, soaking them.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Afterwards the plan formed in her
    mind.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She showered, shaved her legs and
    armpits, and after some thought, her pussy as well. Brian had wanted her to for a long
    time, but she thought of it as being too sluttish. OK, now's the time to be a slut. He
    wouldn't get a chance to enjoy it, but she could tease him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She put on her shortest skirt and a
    tight halter-top. Nothing under. She drank some more water before she left for the
    restaurant area.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She found him in the third place she
    looked. In his best suit he was sitting in a booth at the back, away from the eating area.
    The girl was actually quite beautiful, and far from the tart Melanie had pictured. She had
    brown hair to her shoulders, wore black stretch pants and dark red blouse, and looked a
    bit rounder than Melinda; maybe a year or two older.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda found a place behind his
    back, where she could watch the girl. Melinda had never seen her before, and counted on
    the girl not knowing her either.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl patted his hand and rose.
    It was time for plan A.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda went over to him, smiling.
    -Brian dear!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Astonished, he didn't say a word. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Quickly Melinda straddled his lap,
    feeling his crotch against her naked sex.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;-Darling, she smiled, lifting
    her skirt slightly, -look what I have done!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">His eyes darted from her face to her
    naked pussy and back. He was still unable able to speak.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She leaned forward and whispered in
    his ear, all emotion gone from her voice. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Brian, you prick, I think you are
    wetting your panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At that she opened her sluices,
    soaking his crotch area completely. Before he could react she jumped off, shouting:<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;-Brian Martin, what the hell
    are you doing?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He looked down, turned white, and
    scrambled for the door.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda smiled at the astonished
    onlookers, smoothed her skirt (which was completely dry), and sat down. Here comes plan B.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl returned, looking
    bewildered at Brian's empty seat, noticing that jacket and wallet was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I'm sorry, Melinda said, -but I
    thought this table was free.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-But - Brian -<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-The guy in the suit? Oh, he just
    paid his bill and left. I think he went with some girl.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Shit.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Sorry?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Nothing. Oh yes, quite a lot,
    actually. Oh well. Might as well drink up. Feel free to join me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Thank you, Melinda said, putting a
    little sadness in her voice. She signaled for a waiter. -I'm Melinda, by the way.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Tracy, the girl said, extending a
    hand.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda received her drink, sniffed,
    and looked bravely at Tracy. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Sorry, she said, -I'm a little bit
    upset. Be OK in a minute.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Like to talk? Seems I've got
    nothing else to do but listen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Oh no, I couldn't -<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Come on. Girl talk.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda sniffed again, kept an eye
    on the clock, and told her story: The guy she'd been living with had ditched her, just
    like that.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then Tracy told her story, about the
    man who had pestered her for a date for three weeks, before she had given in yesterday,
    and even taken him home. And now, he had deserted her right here! He, who had been single
    for two years, couldn't get enough, obviously!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Single! The deceitful prick!
    Melinda's plan was somehow to make a fool of the floozy, as well, but it seemed they
    actually were in the same situation, both been thoroughly lied to, and so: Plan C was
    forming itself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda had put her hand on Tracy's
    while she talked, giving sympathetic pressure when needed. Actually, tears came easily,
    but more from anger than from loss. Her life with Brian was finished. But there was one
    more thing she could do, and it wouldn't even be pretending. She wiped her cheek, and
    smiled at the nice girl who was resenting her date more and more as she recalled manners
    and behavior she had reacted to, but tried to overlook.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Got to pee, Melinda said. -Want to
    come?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tracy squeezed her hand. -Been
    bursting for some time, too.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda rose, legs together,
    conscious of the fact that there was a mere inch of cloth covering her naked fanny. She
    cast a glance at Tracy's rounded butt and the obvious signs of needing to go, feeling a
    short tingle in her own sex.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Like many girls, she had had
    experiences with girlfriends. The line between friendly hugs and touches, and the more
    erotic contact, was easily moved. At times Melinda had felt quite attracted to other
    girls, and some of these moments were among her best memories. Given the circumstances the
    bond to Tracy was strengthening, and frankly, she really had lovely buttocks.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They slid the bolt on the cubicle.
    Tracy went first, revealing white lace panties and a well-trimmed bush, sighing with
    relief as she sat down. She looked up at Melinda, face only inches from her hemline in the
    narrow space. Melinda had to hold herself from excitement and need. Tracy reached up and
    touched her thigh at the hemline, making Melinda shiver. -Have to go?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-A bit excited, as well?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She nodded again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Me too. It feels good, peeing in
    front of you. You have nice legs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Thanks, Tracy. You have a lovely
    slim waist and really cute breasts.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Not as slim as yours.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda stroked her sides. -But I
    don't have real hips, like you.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tracy smiled. -I guess we're both
    envious, right? She tore off a strip of paper and wiped herself. -Your turn. Want to go
    somewhere, where we could be alone?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She played straight into Melinda's
    hands. Melinda gave her a hug before sitting down, barely getting her butt onto the seat
    before the flow began. She lifted her skirt: -Look, no panties!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Smart girl! Then you can pee
    anywhere!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Exactly, Melinda giggled. And was
    she going to!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She looked at her watch. Brian would
    probably be back in a few minutes, if he acted according to his nature: Never one to give
    up the chance to be with a woman. They'd better leave now. -Let's go to my place, she
    said. -The prick will be staying out tonight, so we could drink up his wine and leave our
    used panties on the floor. She stood up; feeling warm drops on the inside of her thighs,
    smoothed her skirt and gave Tracy a quick kiss on the cheek. -Let's take a taxi.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They held hands during the ride.
    Arriving at her - his - apartment she wondered if he had stayed home after all, but true
    to type, he was out, probably looking all over for his date.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But his date was sitting in his
    sofa, drinking a 1987 Bourgogne, with her feet on the table and her hand on Melinda's
    thigh.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-What's that?&nbsp; She said,
    pointing to a stain on the cushion beside her. -Spilt something?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Giggling, Melinda shook her head.
    -Pissed my pants, just to be naughty.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tracy burst into laughter. -Serves
    him right! Hey, do you have a picture of this bastard? As a warning, like?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda had anticipated this moment.
    -Over on the back wall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She held her breath while Tracy rose
    out of view. She heard the unbelieving voice: -The total fucker - do you know who this is?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I know, Melinda said, suddenly
    afraid she had gone too far. -Sorry for deceiving you. I didn't intend to -<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Bullshit. Melinda felt Tracy's arms
    around her. -This is a great story. I have to admit I was a little bit scared of this guy
    of yours, in case he came home and made a scene. I wouldn't want to be caught in the
    middle of something that was none of my business. But now it certainly is my business. Mel
    dear let him come. He's in for a surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Thanks, Tracy. She lifted her face
    and received a kiss.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I have to pee again, Tracy said.
    -Let me see. She looked around, then went over to a Persian rug, dropped pants and
    panties, and squatted. Melinda watched as she rose and dressed, aroused by the sight of
    Tracy's shapely body in the stretch pants. Her hand slipped under her skirt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tracy reached out for her. -Where's
    the bedroom?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda rose on unsteady legs. -In
    there.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I want you, Tracy said. -Come on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melinda followed, one hand between
    her legs to keep the pee from flowing. She was saving herself for bed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At 2.30 am she woke from a small
    sound. She nudged Tracy awake, and they sat up in bed, arms around each other, hearing
    cursing from the living room. A head appeared in the doorway.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Hello, Brian, she said as she felt
    Tracy's warm flood soak the bed.</span></font></p>
