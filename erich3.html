    style="mso-special-character:line-break">
<o:p></o:p>    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Here's my expense report, Ms.
    DiPesto!&quot; said Henry. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin Bouvier didn't even look up.
    She didn't appreciate the joke, since she didn't think she looked like Agnes DiPesto from
    Moonlighting. She did have very large eyes. There was, she supposed, some association. But
    she was also an odd duck. She liked period clothing. These days, she wore her salt and
    pepper hair in a wing cut. She favored wrap dresses, ribbed hose and ankle strap high
    heels. She told the curious she just liked different styles. She saw it in a magazine.
    Simple as that. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Henry saw more, Henry liked her.
    While friends at work were always a bonus, she hoped he wouldn't act on it. He wasn't bad
    looking; she just never dated anyone from work. Especially right now.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This afternoon, she shuffled Henry's
    expense report for his trip to Chicago into a folder with all the others. She'd be doing
    them before the end of the week. She swallowed a vitamin, then drank the rest of a large
    bottle of water down, then went to the water cooler and filled it again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;How much water do you drink in
    a day? Where do you put it?&quot; said Candace, the slut from across the hall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm a camel,&quot; Erin said,
    without looking up. Candace was sleeping with her boss. Not Candace's boss, a bull dyke
    who was actually very friendly to Erin, but Erin's boss, a conceited prick who considered
    himself God's Gift. Erin looked on this as a bad situation waiting to evolve. And she had
    something to lose. She'd fought her way up from secretary to accounting clerk. Candace was
    the kind of woman who competed with all women.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">C'mon, UPS, said Erin, under her
    breath. The afternoon was wearing on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she got back to her desk, the
    intercom lit up.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Erin, this is Sylvia. You have
    a package up here,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thanks, Sylvia, I'll come
    up,&quot; she replied, turning on her heel to click click click up the hall to the
    receptionist.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sylvia was on the phone, on her
    headset, and other lights were blinking. The reception area was empty. She pointed at the
    UPS envelope on her desk. The UPS man was piling other packages in the chair next to
    Sylvia's desk and proffering the clipboard for her signature. Erin took her package,
    mouthed thanks to Sylvia, and then went back down the hallway, click, click, and click.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She opened the envelope quickly,
    took out the plain, white envelope inside and crammed it in her purse in one, smooth
    motion. She drank down half her water, and then went in the bathroom with her purse.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Inside, she went in a stall, locked
    the door and sat. She didn't pull her dress up or her panties down. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She felt the urge. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She controlled it. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She opened her purse, took out the
    badly crumpled envelope she'd crammed in the top, opened it and unfolded a piece of paper.
<o:p></o:p>    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sandman Motel. Room Seven.
    Five O&#146;clock. No Air Conditioning,&quot; said the neatly penciled invitation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A key fell out of the envelope and
    onto the tile floor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The bathroom door opened as she
    reached for the key and she recognized Candace's tiny, high-heeled mantraps.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What's that?&quot; Said
    Candace, the feet coming so quickly over, a well manicured, high maintenance hand reaching
    suddenly to the tiles where the key on its ring with its plastic fob had but a moment ago
    been. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin crammed the key and letter back
    in her purse, put the purse on the little shelf on the door, then whooshed her skirt up
    and off her butt, leaving her soft, round bottom to descend on the seat, straining her
    old, yellowed, lace underwear. She had a passing thought about just letting some fly,
    through her old panties, but pulled up. Her soft, well upholstered fuzzy thing rose up in
    the crotch of her panties, and as her lips slid past the silk crotch onto the seam and
    lace, she felt it, got a little warm, felt a little girl juice lubricate her lips. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Is that you, Erin? If I drank
    as much water as you, I'd be in here all the time!&quot; she said, her lilting, always
    playful sing-song voice starting in front of the door, then going to the side as she
    entered a stall, the little, high heeled feet moving quickly, step, step, step, stepping
    until they fronted the commode, then they clip clap about-faced, pointing out.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Candace pulled the door shut with a
    terrific bang which shook all the dividers and made Erin jump off the seat, then settle
    her soft, round ass back down. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From the next stall, after a whoosh
    of skirt and a snapping of elastic, there came the sound of a garden hose, full force, in
    the toilet.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin got up and zipped her purse
    shut after cramming the note and the key down into its nether reaches. She pulled on the
    door's slide and tried to pull her dress down simultaneously, a feat that almost sent the
    purse rolling off the shelf. The water music followed her out, silenced only by the door's
    closing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She made it back to her desk, looked
    at the clock and saw it was 4:25. She locked her desk, shut down her computer and turned
    to leave five minutes early.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Didn&#146;t your momma teach
    you to wash your hands?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She ignored Candace's question,
    popped the moment she opened the bathroom door, to stalk out. Candace was five two and
    105. Erin was five nine and 185. At this particular moment, she wanted to pop Candace.
    What was she saying to her boss? You couldn't turn your back on a person like that in the
    office. In the space of that thought, she traversed the hallway; the reception area and
    she found she had opened the front door.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Goodnight, Erin,&quot; said
    Sylvia from the reception desk.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Goodnight, Sylvia,&quot; Erin
    turned and replied, a genuinely friendly, soft, contralto. It was so different from her
    usual office voice even Sylvia noticed and smiled a winning smile as the tinted door
    closed, leaving Sylvia in the curtained, air- conditioned reception room, and Erin in the
    blazing light and heat.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin walked to her car, her leather
    high heels making clopping and dragging sounds on the half-melted asphalt. She got in and
    lowered all the electric windows. It was an old car, but the A/C worked fine and would
    have taken the interior from 130 degrees to a comfortable 70 in five minutes, but she
    drove off with the windows down instead, as she'd been commanded. At the first traffic
    light, she turned the A/C on, but still left the windows down. She could feel what the hot
    seat was doing to her back, her ass, her thighs, but at least her face didn't have to
    suffer.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She passed the Sandman at five to
    five. Almost out of town, out of the way, once a stopover for tourists before expressways,
    dead palm trees now graced the shabby front of it. Someone filled in the pool with mud and
    put a bird- bath in the middle at some point. &quot;Color TV by RCA&quot; still hung
    crookedly out front, under the Sandman sign.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She drove past it and turned on the
    next street. She passed by the back, stopped at the stop sign, and then drove on.
    Somewhere on the next block, she turned around, drove back, then parked between two other
    cars in back of a convenience store that fronted on the next street. She pressed the
    button and all the windows went back up. She got out. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she stood up, she had to pull
    up strongly. A panicky look crossed her face, just for a moment. She felt her pubic hair
    pull where it'd gone through the lace of her panties. Her lips, now slick, sliding along
    the soft, silky insert in the crotch, wet, wetting it, the hair stuck on her soft, curvy
    inner thighs pulling free, a slight breeze up her dress cooling the sweat between her
    legs, she grimaced.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She pulled her dress off her back
    and legs, where it stuck, and out of the crack of her ass. After pulling her dress
    straight, she locked her door and clip clopped across the worn, potholed road.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She stepped behind a seven-foot high
    wooden fence that obscured the gap in the cinderblock wall that ran between the two rows
    of rooms at the Sandman. They were numbered with great thought by someone back in the
    1940's. One through seven were on one side. Eight through 14 were on the other, such that
    room number one was opposite room 14 at the front and seven and eight faced each other at
    the rear. She stepped to the door of number seven and unzipped her purse.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The key was where she put it, lost
    way down in the nether reaches of her purse, so she had to rummage. While she rummaged,
    she stepped anxiously from one, high-heeled foot to the other, making clap-scratching
    sounds on the flagstone in front of the door. Finally she found the key. She pulled it out
    of her purse with a nervous jerk, stuck it in the lock, twisted, opened, and stepped
    quickly inside.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The inside was dark. She looked on
    the old, RCA TV on its metal stand just to the left of the door and saw a small, potted
    plant atop it. White periwinkles. She pushed the door closed behind her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was totally dark. Her eyes
    weren't adjusted. Someone grabbed her from behind.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">An arm wrapped around her waist like
    a python. A hand descended across her mouth. Hot breath blew on her cheek; a bony cheek
    with five o'clock shadow scraped her soft face. Another bone pressed her soft bottom.
    Pushed her forward so her heels came off the floor a fraction.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No fuss,&quot; whispered a
    male voice in her ear.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; She
    said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I said be quiet!&quot; The
    voice said, still whispering.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OHHHH, NO!&quot; She said
    through his fingers, and she felt it begin to happen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her lips, sumptuous, wet, surrounded
    by a soft nest of hair, went down into the warm, fragrant, femaleness of the satiny crotch
    of her worn, lace panties, and spurted an ounce of yellow that went through, dripping on
    her soft, curvy white inner thighs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The cock in the pants of her
    assailant pushed her soft, full ass and she stumbled forward, spurted again, and then lost
    it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; She said,
    bending. His cock pressed her cheek some more, shoving gently.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She pissed so hard, so suddenly, she
    wet the front of her dress voluminously with a jet of piss that went through the satiny
    crotch of her panties and spread out over the lap of her dress. Then there was so much it
    shooshed back and off the back end of the soft, wet, silkiness and wet the back of her
    dress. She pissed down her legs; puddled on the floor, wet the trousers of the man holding
    her from behind. Then a hand spanked her fat veranda. Hard.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OHHHHH!&quot; She said, and he
    spanked her ass again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OHHHHH! AAAuuugh!&quot; She

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Walk to the bathroom,
    cunt,&quot; the voice commanded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She fell out of his arms and
    undulated to the bathroom like a truculent camel.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Walk back here,&quot; said the
    man.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She strutted back, eyes wide, lips
    apart, hips swiveling.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Take my pants off,&quot; he
    commanded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She went on her knees, removed his
    belt, unbuttoned, unzipped. They fell around his ankles. She kissed his cock through his
    briefs, a momentary, breathy presence of her lips on the head of his cock, through the
    material, and then she stood up again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He stepped out of his pants and
    pulled her skirt up. He pulled her panties down, going down on his knees to finish, taking
    them off her, raising one foot, then the other. He stood up and looked at them. Then he
    handed them to her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;In the bathtub,&quot; he said.
    She went in the bathroom and threw her pissy, messy lace panties where he commanded, and
    then she grabbed some TP, wiped quickly, threw it in the toilet, and then stalked back to
    him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He grabbed her, threw her on the
    bed, pulled out his cock and showed it to her. Then he pushed her up the bed, parted her
    legs, and entered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, no! NO! You're not wearing
    any protection! Greg! We can't! You mustn't finish in me! Ejaculate on my legs!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Greg paid no attention. He went into
    her to the hilt. Pushed her up to the headboard until her head bonked it and all the
    joints of the bed squeaked and cracked. He shoved her legs wide apart. She wrapped them
    around him. He felt the gritty leather of her high-heeled shoes on his hard, round ass,
    the heels poking his thighs. She felt her toenails scrape the soft leather of the insides
    of her shoes as she curled her toes, running her stockings at the toe. She tried to pull
    up. He grabbed the wide planes of the top of her magnificent ass and hauled her down,
    impaling her on his cock. He felt a garter snap under his hand. He rose up, and then
    entered her one, last time to the hilt, from a high angle. She screamed, fish faced, and
    came, hard. He gushed in her. She turned her head away suddenly. He buried his face in the
    hair at the nape of her neck. She pushed her pelvis up at him, raising him, as he pulsed,
    spasmed, filled her inside with a warm, wet, salty lake she undeniably welcomed with all
    the enthusiasm her flesh could muster. And he kept pushing every now and again,
    erratically, unpredictably, keeping her going until she was done, finished, exhausted, a
    sumptuous, sweaty, conquered, happy woman, breathing softly, sighing, chuckling a little,
    crying almost. Greg realized she'd shredded his back again and made a mental note that he
    had to find an alternative to strap style tee shirts she would agree to. Or make her file
    her nails.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a while, he arose and went in
    the bathroom. She snored softly, her hair sprayed out around her head on the pillow. He
    looked in the bath at the yellow, deteriorating silk panties with a little mess in them.
    He swirled them in the toilet, then put them in the sink in the soapy, warm water. He hung
    her faded, dry clean only dress on a hanger, took it to the shower and ran the shower on
    it until it was clean. He hung it on the rod. He rinsed himself off in the shower and put
    on shorts and sandals. Outside, he went through the wall in the back and got her other
    clothes out of her car for her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She lay there, eating crackers,
    getting crumbs in the sullen sheets, and looking towards the TV, which was turned off. The
    comment came because she was actually looking at the periwinkles in the pot. They'd worked
    it out- never at either one's home. But they needed signals. Just in case. If the
    periwinkles hadn't been there, she would have backed out fast, pepper spray in hand.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    news. Bad news. Unstable world, nukes, terrorists, unemployment, stagnant economy, no more
    social security lockbox, the world economy, the euro dollar ... their fingers found the

    shorts, a polo pony tee. She came out of the bathroom in a white blouse and taut skirt,
    the ankle strap heels, no hose. She primped her wing cut, got a small mirror out of her
    large purse and tried to put on lipstick and got some on one of her many straight, white
    teeth that made it hard for her to close her mouth. She had a weak chin and constantly
    tried to thrust it out to compensate. This made her look like pigeon-woman applying
    makeup. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her ass and thighs looked like a map
    of Africa in that skirt if you looked at her from the side. A mild speech impediment
    sometimes got the better of her and some words changed. In this case, taut changed to
    taunt. He liked it very much. He rose to the occasion. He got off the bed and pushed her
    into the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You're not wearing any
    underwear,&quot; he said, and he pulled her taut skirt up to her hips, revealing her dark
    triangle, wet, with a splash of cream on her creamy white thighs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, no ... &quot; She began,
    but he pulled his zipper down and his cock swung out, large, stiffening, rising.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ohhhhh ... &quot; She gasped,
    and her muscular legs went into motion, moon walking her high heels frantically up the
    old, ornate, wooden baseboard. She looked at the ceiling, while the palms of her hands
    explored the warped veneer of the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she felt his large, hot head
    begin to part her lips; she put one, high-heeled foot on the bedside table. She barely got
    it there before he went up in her like an ascending piston, smoothly pushing up until his
    pubic hair ground into hers and she felt her other foot almost come off the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    turning her head to one side, her sure fire sign to him. He felt her spasm and fall
    towards him, holding him, her fingers finding his back and her nails gripping.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ah ... AH ... AAAAugh!&quot;
    She screeched in his ear.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">His cock jumped inside her, spurted,
    pushed, hosed in her. She clamped down on him and felt her breath leaving, her sight
    dimming, the room going dark and her hearing condensing to a roaring, rushing sound within
    her ears.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    eight. The nurse at the front desk watched a vivacious, glowing woman in a white blouse
    and a tight, off white skirt make her way through the lobby and up the north wing. She
    knew Erin Bouvier from her many visits and they smiled briefly from across the lobby. She
    would go to room 125 and sit with her comatose husband for a while, then go home. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Drunk driver. No insurance. Mark
    Bouvier would never die. He also would never wake up, everything in his head dead above
    the medulla. He'd had his fifteen minutes and more on the local news in a legal battle
    over withdrawing his feeding tube. His parents won. But the HMO wanted the money from
    Erin. She surrendered and filed for bankruptcy. Now she lived in a cheap apartment with
    her daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ten minutes later, Greg Stafford
    arrived and went to the south wing after a brief word with the nurse. His wife was dying
    of heart disease. Slowly. A heart attack a year and a half ago had deprived her brain of
    oxygen for more than 10 minutes before Greg found her, called 911 and commenced CPR. This
    evening, he wondered if he'd want to continue living in this town after she passed, he so
    associated it with his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The nurse watched one leave at 10
    something. The other stayed until one in the morning, way past visiting hours, and they'd
    either been crying or they were in need of a good night's sleep. The nurse barely noticed,
    she continued reading the National Perspirer.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One afternoon, a couple months back,
    the same nurse had gone to the cafeteria and seen Greg Stafford and Erin Bouvier, who were
    deep in conversation ahead of her in the line. They took their coffee at a table for two,
    their heads close together until they left. But that was months ago, and since she'd never
    seen them together again, the nurse didn't remember it, even when someone asked her about
    it and showed her a beat up photo of Erin.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">**********<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I met Erin's husband's mother at a
    Starbuck's in the mall. She bought a large, double whipped latte with vanilla flavoring
    and cinnamon sprinkles. I grabbed their basic cuppa joe, black, and handed her the
    photographs. Erin in a wrap dress and ankle strap heels, leaving work in her old car; Erin
    arriving home on an average evening at dusk. Erin arriving at work; Erin coming and going
    at the nursing home. With her daughter six nights; alone on one other; Erin going to the
    grocery store with her daughter. Erin waving as her daughter went off in some soccer mom's
    car to a pajama party.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Nothing but a normal mom and
    her daughter living their life,&quot; I volunteered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I still don't think that
    woman's a fit mother. That apartment house where she's moved isn't a good environment for
    children to grow up; it looks sleazy! I'm sure she's broken her marriage vows in front of
    my granddaughter; I feel it in my bones! She's told me Erin comes home real late
    sometimes! One time she told me Erin told her a cockamamie story about a guy at her office
    bringing her home because she had car trouble. Car trouble, my left ear! How come you
    haven't got any pictures of her inside the office?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I avoided asking her why she
    might've given up a lovely house and moved to an apartment. Instead, I confined myself to
    answering the woman's question: Why didn't I take pictures of her at work through the
    window? &quot;She is an accounting clerk who used to be a secretary. She probably still
    has to answer the phone when the secretary's out. She doesn't rate a window.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin's husband's mother couldn't get
    her son back, so she was trying to take a granddaughter who would soon be old enough that
    the judge would have to ask her what she wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I want you to follow her for
    another week,&quot; the old lady said, pushing a check across the table that covered this
    week and the next, twice what I expected. She shoved her lower lip out and pouted. She was
    angry I'd dug no dirt for her. And time was running out quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OK!&quot; I said, stuffing the
    check into my pocket without hesitation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I got home, I collected the
    pictures from the Sandman, all outside shots, her coming and going, a man going into the
    trunk of her old car for some dry cleaning, and put them on the coffee table, along with
    the negatives. I fed everything through the shredder. Then I poured myself a cold one.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
