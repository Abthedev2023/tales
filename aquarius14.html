    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I started studying with Miss
    Anderson at fourteen. I had played for as long as I can remember, and was ready to go on
    to more difficult pieces - thence the private lessons. Miss Anderson was around thirty and
    usually dressed in proper skirt and blouse, with her auburn hair tied into a bun. Still,
    she was the object of my fantasies, being a woman who took me seriously, as opposed to the
    girls of my own age, who were either plain and giggly or pretty and condescending. She was
    petite, about my height at that time, and the decent clothes did not hide her womanly
    shape.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I kept my dreams a secret for four
    years. After returning that autumn from three months' break, I found myself a couple of
    inches taller, with voice and stubbles to match.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She looked at me - looked up at me -
    and said, -It seems you've turned into a man, Chris. Let's drop this Miss stuff, why don't
    you just call me Denise?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had been practicing all summer.
    Miss - Denise - complimented me on my playing, and it looked as though her eyes were
    complimenting my looks. She searched her sheets for some new pieces and we set off to
    work. She sat beside me on the stool, skirt to mid-thigh, touching my hands to correct my
    finger settings. I felt her leg against mine and sensed the scent of woman.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the lesson was over she offered
    me a cup of tea. We shared her sofa, and I fantasized about putting my arm on the backrest
    letting it casually slide down to touch her neck.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-This tea goes right through me, she
    said as she rose to go to the bathroom.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She didn't close the door. I heard
    the rustle of clothes, and then the sound of the stream. When she returned it was my turn.
    I sat on the bowl to be where her thighs and bottom had touched it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I left she squeezed my hand
    briefly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The next time she also made us tea
    when we were through. Again sitting on the sofa, talking of music and school and holidays.
    After some time she was sitting with her knees pressed together. She put a hand on my
    thigh.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-We girls have to go all the time,
    she said. -Isn't that right?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I don't know a lot of girls, I said
    truthfully.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She patted my thigh. -Just you wait.
    She rose and left.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Again I heard her through the open
    door, becoming strangely aroused by the sound. I had to rearrange myself so as not be too
    obvious. Denise returned, smoothing her skirt and smiling at me. A few loose strands of
    hair touched her cheek.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This became the usual routine after
    lessons. She would make tea or offer soft drinks, hinting about my (nonexistent) love
    affairs, then make a show of needing the bathroom. She was always dressed in proper skirts
    and a blouse or a turtleneck, but somehow the primness seemed put-on. As if there were
    someone inside just waiting to get out.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Late October. It was raining, we had
    just completed a difficult piece by Chopin, and she turned to me with her hand on my leg,
    quite high up. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-This achievement calls for
    celebration, she said. -How about something stronger? Do you like sherry?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I don't know, I said. I never
    bragged to Denise.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Then it's time for a taste. I'll
    get a glass of water for you, too.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She fetched the drinks, and we sat
    on the sofa. I liked the sherry, and she recommended that I drink the water as well, so it
    wouldn't hit me too fast. She was quick to offer me a refill, giving me a pleasurable
    buzz. She looked even more lovely and relaxed. Eventually she showed the familiar signs of
    having to go to the bathroom, she rocked a little and rubbed her legs together. The skirt
    rode up, giving me the tiniest glimpse of white.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The wine and the sight made me
    dizzy, and I also needed to pee after all that water. I went to the bathroom and relieved
    myself noisily, thinking about her listening. When I was washing my hands she was standing
    in the doorway, legs crossed. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I can't wait, she said, stepping up
    to the toilet. In one fluid motion she reached under her skirt, pulled her panties down,
    and sat. Sighing with relief, lips slightly parted, she emptied her bladder while I was
    watching.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Do you like seeing me like this?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to know.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I nodded, realizing my erection must
    be obvious.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-There are so many ways to pleasure.
    Weeing is one of them, right? When you really have to go, and then... Okay. Excuse me
    while I wipe.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I staggered back to the sofa. On
    returning she stood before me, reaching out to touch my arm.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>-Maybe
    - no. I'll see you next week.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The next week she wore her hair in a
    ponytail. I didn't realize it was that long. She had also put on a shorter skirt, and lace
    showed where a button on her blouse was undone. But the lesson went as usual, she was an
    excellent teacher and expected results. Towards the end, however, she edged closer and her
    thighs touched mine all the way. Putting the sheet music away she turned to me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-You will stay for tea, Chris?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Of course, Denise.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-And maybe a Coke or something?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Sounds good.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We drank. Talking, she touched my
    arm nearly all the time. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Oh well, she said eventually, -time
    for the bathroom again. She paused. -You know, I wet myself at a concert once.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Really?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-When I was about your age. All
    those people made me so nervous. I sat on the stool, in a long blue dress, and suddenly I
    felt the warm wetness between my legs. I managed to stop it, and played the concert. I had
    to retire backwards to hide it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I bet you looked cute, I said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She smiled. -If I don't go
    immediately, you'll get the chance to see if it's cute.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In a way she seemed to be waiting
    for something, but I was too excited to think. She rose and left, butt swaying.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One week later. She wore jeans. She
    was really beautiful. Even going through Rachmaninoff I could hardly keep my eyes off her
    thighs and belly clothed in tight blue denim.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She gripped my hands. -Chris. I'm so
    much older than you, but all I can think of is looking good for you. Do you think I'm
    crazy?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-You are the most wonderful woman
    I've ever met, Denise. Would you please, please untie your hair?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She removed her elastic band and let
    it fall. I kissed her cheek. She smiled at me and rearranged the sheets. -Fifteen more
    minutes. From bar sixty, please.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the final chord dissolved into
    nothing she put her hand on me. Right there, on my khaki pants. Looked me in the eyes,
    hand softly moving, lips parted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Perfect, she whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-What?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-The music. You. Everything.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was hard under her touch. She
    turned to me with her knees inches apart, back arched, and chest heaving. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-If I'm stepping over the line,
    please say so.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I shook my head.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Like some wine?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Cat got your tongue?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Well - someone's got my...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She laughed. -Come on. Sofa time.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She poured white wine and toyed with
    my hair as we drank. I kept my hand on her denim thigh, moving it a little upwards,
    stroking. Slowly she pushed my hand up until it stopped. I felt the warmth from her
    crotch. -I have to pee, she said. -Do you?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Oh yes.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Let's wait a while, she said,
    holding my neck. -May I kiss you?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I bent forward, meeting her lips and
    then her tongue. Her hand found me again. We came up for air, and she lifted her glass.
    -To pleasure, she said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was beginning to feel some
    pressure, and so was she, judging from the way she kept her legs pressed together. We
    kissed again, and she put my hand on her breast. -I'm almost wetting my panties with lust,
    she whispered in my ear. -Want to feel me?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Before I could answer she unbuttoned
    her jeans and slid my hand down, outside her panties. -Ooh, she sighed as I felt her
    unusual warmth. -I guess I can't hold myself much longer, she whispered. -Want to come to
    the bathroom?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Inside she stood, swaying slowly,
    with legs crossed. I looked at the place where her thighs met, hoping for a glimpse of the
    wetness I had felt. Her top three buttons were undone, showing white panties. She pulled
    me closer and kissed me, putting a hand on my bulge. -Do you need to pee?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I'm bursting!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Me too. Just let go a little.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I relaxed for a second and the warm
    stream ran down my leg. She moaned and squeezed me, then pushed me away to look at me. She
    was rubbing her feet together, almost dancing. Quickly she pushed my hand down her
    panties, letting me feel a short, sharp jet over my fingers. I pressed against the wet
    curls, and my finger slid into her. With that touch she leaked again, holding me for
    support. I stroked her, making her pee in small bursts. Now it was my turn to look, and I
    stared at the incredibly sexy stain on her crotch. She squeezed me again, and I came in my
    pants.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-It's OK, Chris, she said. -We have
    time. She embraced me, and I held her bottom, feeling wetness where the stain had spread.
    I grew hard again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Sit on that stool, she said. She
    straddled my lap, giving me a full view of her soaked crotch. -Pee your pants, Chris.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I let go, sighing with relief as the
    warmth spread. Before I was finished Denise let her pee flow, creating shining streams
    from her spread legs. The pools under us merged.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Slowly we undressed each other,
    touching wet clothing, stroking moist skin. She led me to her bedroom. I looked at her
    rounded body, enjoying the smell of fresh pee and woman. Denise lay down on the bed. -Come
    on, Chris. -Play me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
