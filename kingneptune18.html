    The bailiff's voice rang out as the uniformed official obeyed the Judge's nod toward him.
    &quot;Mr. Mansfield, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
    truth?&quot; Paul Mansfield nodded, his voice failing in fear. What was he doing here??
    How had this happened!!?? The bailiff's voice continued, droning on in that official
    monotone reserved for officers of the law. Finally the explanation of charges was complete
    and the courtroom grew tense, quiet, as the judge's voice grimly intoned. &quot;How do you
    plead?&quot; Paul spat out the word &quot;innocent!&quot; in an exclamatory manner. How
    else did they expect him to plead? They, anyone, would understand if only they had been
    there! Paul's mind began to replay the events of that life-changing day. It seemed only
    yesterday, the fateful newscast that had started it all:<br>
    <br>
    It began like any of the countless mid-day newscasts he had produced over the years. Now,
    though, looking back, he realized something was amiss when the station's call sign was
    announced incorrectly. He continued to replay the telecast in his mind.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good evening and welcome to KWET's Hollywood prime time news at noon, coming to you
    live from the glamour capital of the world.&quot; The big story again today in Tinsel Town
    is the recent flu outbreak. It is believed to have originated in Northern California, and
    started out like any other flu outbreak. Reports began trickling in as usual, nothing
    severe, mild headache, sometimes fever and upset stomach. Then, as the first to be
    infected began to recover and return to their normal routines, rumors of complications
    began to flow.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;At first, it seemed to be attributable to the diuretic effects of the cold and flu
    medicines and the high volume of liquids victims drank to maintain hydration while they
    were ill. Eventually, though, more detailed reports of post-flu complications began to
    flood in and scientists could only conclude that this was an outbreak of a very different
    strain of flu.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sufferers, feeling normal, return to their daily routines. Within 24 to 48 hours
    they discover a moderate to severe loss of bladder control. In the most moderate cases,
    which are also the most common, victims may feel a need to urinate 15 to 30 seconds before
    they began doing so involuntarily without the ability to stop. In more severe cases,
    victims simply start to urinate without warning or control.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is also considered quite significant that 9 out of 10 victims simply smile
    happily and refuse medical treatment for these complications. Scientists have received
    reports of this effect lasting from a minimum of 24 hours to an apparently permanent
    condition. It was, of course, instantly dubbed the Pee Flu. Currently, legislation is
    being enacted in emergency sessions with lawmakers in 49 states to prevent development of
    a vaccine, with Alaska, for obvious reasons, vigorously pursuing such research. In a
    related story, the stock market showed record gains today, driven by increasing sales of
    certain paper products.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Asked if his company intended to increase production, one executive replied:
    &quot;Depends.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In a lesser-known item, 2 scientists at the Larry-LillyLiver Labs shared the Nobel
    peace prize for discovering a virus which causes people to lose bladder control.&quot;
    Doctors Weiner and Heine Wetter accepted their accolades with typical scientific reserve,
    but giggled uncontrollably when asked what they intended to do with their discovery.
    Unfortunately, the virus was spilled in a local post office and seems to be missing.
    Postal authorities and other representatives from our government have assured us this is
    completely unrelated to the first story. Now, a word from our sponsor.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>(Break- Off-Air)</strong>&nbsp; Anchor: &quot;Good grief, can we get someone in
    here from housekeeping to clean up this mess? This floor is getting really slick. Turn off
    that air conditioning, too, I'm freezing my nuts off!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Also, I need another pair of dry pants and a cushion for my chair; a dry one.&quot;
    &quot;What do you mean no more coffee; it just adds to the problem??&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>(Back live- On Air)</strong>&nbsp; &quot;Stay tuned for our Weather Girl's recital
    of the new updated 'The Night Before Christmas story.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For KWET News, this is I. P. Freely wishing you a wet Hollywood Holiday
    season.&quot; (Cut to Lisa Lowecutt, KWET's over-endowed, under dressed Weather
    personality, trying to stand still enough to begin reading the copy from the
    Teleprompter.) &quot;Hello, I'm Lisa- Ohh! (She her grabs crotch.) Lowecutt. Welcome to
    KWET's Holiday Classic Minute, brought to you tonight by Groctor and Pamble, makers of
    many fine products you're going to need a lot more of this year.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tonight, our updated rendition of the holiday classic 'The Night Before
    Christmas.'&quot; Fanfare and intro music plays while Lisa claws uselessly at her
    darkening dripping yellow crotch. (Note: give a raise to the wardrobe personnel who gave
    her those incredibly skin-tight white pants to wear- nice camel-toe!)<br>
    <br>
    Music ends and Lisa begins speaking in dramatic, if confused, tones:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;T'was the night before Xmas and all through the house, not a creature was dry, not
    even my spouse.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Lisa whispers excitedly to the stage manager as her legs began to darken in a shade
    matching her crotch.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you sure this is how this is supposed to go?&quot; He nods, winking at the
    cameraman who hands him a 50-dollar bill as he is muttering, &quot;I can't believe she
    fell for it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Lisa continues:<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The pissy underwear was hung by the chimney with care, in hopes it would soon dry in
    the warm heated air.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Lisa struggles to avoid slipping in the yellow pool forming at her feet.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asks again. &quot;I don't really, like, remember this
    part.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Shrugging her shoulders as the snickering cameraman nods, she has to hold her heavy sodden
    pants up by hand now as she squints at the Teleprompter and continues reading.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In bed the adults snuggled, trying not to pee pee dance, while spurts of hot piss
    again soaked their pants.<br>
    <br>
    Smiling now with lowered eyelids, Lisa's voice goes warm and husky as she forgets where
    she is and her hand finds her slick hot pissy crotch. She reads slower now, with
    intermittent moans as her heavy irregular breathing and wandering digits makes it hard to
    follow the story.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In only my silk panties (oh!) Without even a cap, I had just settled in for a wet
    (Ohh! Mmmm) winter nap.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Lisa is well into the throes of passion now, her hand deep into her panties, the wet soggy
    pants in a heap around her, and the cameraman's ankles. She screams out the next verse as
    she collapses back on the cameraman whose own legs give way when his dick explodes in
    Lisa's pissy pussy. Speaking louder now to drown out the squelching noises from between
    her legs, Lisa continues.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When what to my- OH, GOD, HARDER YOU TWIT! Wandering hand should appear, but two wet
    hairy balls- FUCK ME LIKE YOU MEAN IT CAMERA BOY! Under a prodigious pissing spear.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    OH GOD I'M CUMMMMMING!!!<br>
    <br>
    From a distance a male voice, actually several, began screaming incoherently. &quot;CUT!
    CUT!! OH FUCK ME, WE'RE DEAD!! CUT!!! The Judge's beginning questions break Paul Mansfield
    from his remembrance, and he begins to answer. &quot;No, your Honour, I cannot explain how
    this happened. No sir, it was an isolated incident and won't happen again. No sir, I'm
    pretty sure the CIA and the NRA didn't plan this together. Yes, sir, I have arranged for
    Lisa Lowecutt to testify alone in your chambers- again.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you, your Honour, for your concern. I don't know if Lisa does still suffer the
    effects of the flu, Your Honour. What flu? Oh, that flu, of course, Your Honour. Yes, Your
    Honour, if you say so, it is wonderful.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Case dismissed? But your Honour, you haven't heard Lisa's testimony yet- I mean
    thank you, your Honour.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Without warning, a thundering noise fills the courtroom and Paul's chair begins to shake,
    gently at first then with increasing intensity. A voice booms from afar, loud,
    insistent... familiar?? Paul recognizes his personal assistant's insistent, lisping
    baritone voice. &quot;Mr. Mansfield! Mr. Mansfield. Wake up sir, it is almost time to do
    the newscast and you might want to clean up a little. Sir? You might want to shower and
    get some dry clothes on.&quot; His short, round and somewhat malformed assistant continues
    as if this is all normal, which of course, it is. &quot;I'm sure Lisa will need make-up as
    well and I'll have wardrobe send her over some uh, dry clothes. Uh, Sir, do you mind if I,
    uh if I take her, uh, pissy panties?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Paul nods assent, irritated by the little man's insistence on asking every time. He
    mentally reviews his thoughts trying to separate his tryst with the always-desperate
    weather girl from the nightmare of which he has just awakened. What a horrible nightmare!
    Imagine! He still had bad dreams about someone objecting to the first newscast about the
    Pee Flu. Of course, it had not gone the way he dreamed it. No one actually had sex on the
    show, but Lisa had sure gotten excited. Hard to believe that was nearly five years ago! Oh
    well, things change. No cure had been found for the permanent loss of bladder control, and
    wet clothes and public peeing had become the standard, if not chosen, norm. Microsoft had
    gone belly-up overnight when the Internet, no longer needed for pee folk, had folded. The
    new billionaires were from an emerging industry, self-warming absorbent clothing and those
    with the foresight to have invested in the still wildly growing detergent market. Those
    few who were resistant to the flu had quickly realized acceptance required wetness and
    readily joined their friend in indiscriminate pissing. A few, holding onto archaic notions
    of dryness being fine, had formed small reform movements but had quickly become
    ostracized.<br>
    <br>
    They found it necessary to go into the closet, so to speak, and try to pass for normal,
    accepting the new social standard and readily joining their friends in pissing themselves.
    It had been a time of confusion and pain for some, as taunts of &quot;Dry Pants! Dry
    Pants!&quot; rang out across school grounds, college campuses and government offices. The
    latest rage among the networks now, of course, was the celebrity pissing shows. Paul
    thinks a little more before throwing up his hands in a &quot;who knew&quot; gesture as a
    confused and very wet Lisa sits up in a cold yellow puddle in the bed, her face reflecting
    confusion. Again. &quot;Fuck it!&quot; Paul shouts to Lisa trying to shake off the
    nightmare. &quot;It doesn't matter.&quot; Having no idea what he is talking about, she
    tries to smiles her Weathergirl smile but the cold pee pooling under her ass is
    distracting. The bed's pee heater must be broken, she finally realizes.<br>
    <br>
    Paul speaks grandly now. &quot;This is Hollywood! I'll write a screenplay about this and
    the movie will make millions.&quot; Forgetting her previous confusion and the cold pee,
    Lisa wonders if she can play herself. She wonders if they will let her pee on film. She
    wonders if she can stop herself from peeing on film. Tired by the effort of thinking, Lisa
    realizes she needs to pee, and does. Lisa is a wonder. The judge thought so too.
    &quot;From all the folks at KWET, have a very Wet Christmas and a Soggy New Year!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Happy Holidays to my wet friends.<br>
