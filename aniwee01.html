    I had several drinks of water before we left. I was told to go to the toilet before we
    left, but I didn't.<o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When
    we got to the park, I was asked to look after my younger sisters. I was wearing black
    knickers, a blue skirt down to my knees, and a white T-shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a while, I began to feel the
    need to pee. I ignored it, and I continued to watch my sisters. My family said they were
    going home for an hour, leaving me on my own with them, a responsibility thing they said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a short while, I really needed
    to pee. I crossed my legs, which helped, but it couldn't hold for long. I could feel the
    pressure on my bladder; it was sort of a dead weight. This didn't help too much, because
    it seemed to sink down. I knew where the toilets were; it was just that I couldn't leave
    them alone.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a while, it became harder to
    hold, so I stood up to get a little pressure off my bladder. It helped, but again, the
    pressure hit me, and I was forced to sit again with my hands in between my crotch. I
    noticed a few people were looking at me, so I let go for a minute, fearing people might
    think that I had a problem. I had to make up an excuse to my sisters if I was going to go
    to the toilet. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After about 10 minutes, it was
    becoming unbearable. So I asked them to come with me to get an ice cream. Total lie, but
    was else could I do? They came, and walking 150 meters to the toilet wasn't what my
    bladder wanted. I was practically pissing myself when we got to the Pavilion. They wanted
    the ice creams, so we went to the shops first-we didn't pass the toilets. When we went to
    the shop and back, on the way, I dribbled a little bit. My sisters didn't see, but I knew
    I couldn't hold on for much longer. When we got to the toilets, they were locked for
    cleaning! I let go there and then as my bladder filled to the over-the-top limit. My
    sisters laughed at me, and they went and told my parents when they came back later on. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I'm now grounded for two months
    because of it; you would think at eighteen I am too old for this, but living under my
    parents' roof, and behaving like a child... All my friends have found out and I'm
    horrified by it. Thankfully my boyfriend was cool about it, though I can't see him for
    ages.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
