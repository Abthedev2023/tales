    <br>
    Robin was a watersports fancier's dream comes true. At least she was my dream come true.
    Tall and willowy with blonde hair that cascaded down her shoulders and a sweet, very
    white, sort of baby face and sparkling, crystal blue eyes, Robin was of German-American
    ancestry.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly after we began our relationship, Robin boldly stated, &quot;My main desire
    sexually is to do precisely whatever pleases you.&quot; She was kind of a sub, but far
    from being passive, exhibited an extremely ebullient, outgoing personality. She cajoled me
    to somewhat reluctantly confess to my watersports affinity; the first time I had done so
    in my entire life.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ohhh, I just know that's going to be my thing!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I pee all
    the time, and really enjoy peeing!&quot; Our first experimentation with water play was
    throughout a weekend at a jewel-box house with a lush garden and circular pool in back. I
    will always remember it as my perfect Eden. I could write a short novel just describing
    that weekend.<br>
    <br>
    Robin and I were together for about two years. The funniest, most adrenalin-pumping
    incident we shared was just after a meal at an elegant French restaurant in Tijuana,
    Mexico.<br>
    <br>
    We had already established that one way Robin could please me enormously was by wetting
    herself in public. She had done so several times, though not terribly conspicuously. The
    night in Tijuana, we had chosen a perfect French restaurant with impeccable service. I
    ordered a delicious ostrich steak. We shared a wonderful bottle of Merlot.<br>
    <br>
    After we had eaten, Robin started to excuse herself to visit the ladies' room. &quot;Can
    you put that off for a little while?&quot; I suggested. I looked at her and smiled. Robin
    returned my smile, with a glint of clear recognition in her eye. &quot;For you, I
    certainly can,&quot; she replied.<br>
    <br>
    We left the restaurant and strolled through the parking lot onto the sidewalk of a fairly
    busy street. Suddenly, Robin froze. &quot;Oh, no! I can't hold it! I can't hold it!&quot;
    she gasped. &quot;It's running down my legs into my socks!&quot; I suggested we return to
    the parking lot.<br>
    <br>
    When we got back to the parking lot, Robin lifted her long, black dress and immediately
    unleashed a three-part stream from her vagina. One part was spraying in a strong stream
    way out in front of her. Another, the strongest, cascaded straight down in a thick,
    gushing flow. A third, weaker stream sort of dribbled down behind her.<br>
    <br>
    As this was going on, we noticed someone exiting the restaurant into the previously
    unoccupied parking lot. As he got closer, we realized it was the maitre d'! This gentleman
    who had served us so beautifully proceeded to his car and, horror of horrors (or delight
    of delights, depending on your perspective) caught the cascading Robin square in his
    headlights, illuminated the scene for the world to see!<br>
    <br>
    Robin, ever the superb sport, laughed uproariously. I grabbed her hand and we ran, Robin
    hiking her skirt, back onto the dark, unpopulated sidewalk. From there Robin ran in a wild
    waddle, urine still streaming down raucously, with her skirt hiked about halfway up, still
    laughing her head off. &quot;Put your skirt down! Put your skirt down!&quot; I yelled,
    having no idea who we might encounter in this upscale but still very public Tijuana
    Street.<br>
    <br>
    We ran about a block up to another parking lot, and Robin stood between two cars and let
    the rest of the recycled wine wash down from between her legs.<br>
    <br>
    After the flood had subsided, we laughed and laughed about the look on the maitre d's face
    and the outrageous scenario of Robin standing there spraying three streams framed by the
    bright headlights. We laughed so hard we could hardly catch our breath. We took a taxi to
    the precious little hot springs resort where we were staying, and what followed was a
    night of wet eroticism never to be forgotten! <font color="#000000" face="Arial"><strong><br>
