    Pee</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Wow! I had such a great
    time with my last public wetting, I just had to do it again sometime - but I just couldn't
    find the time to plan something as elaborate as my first public pee - so I was suprised
    when the next one happened by accident...<br>
    <br>
    I had a long day at work, and did some overtime until about 9PM - to survive I had drank
    no small amount of Coffee... Having had enough I decided to go out for a drink after work
    to relax.<br>
    <br>
    I walked down to the local nightclub, and whilst walking, decided that maybe I should have
    went to the loo before I left. Not being too fond of public toilets anytime, let alone at
    night, I decided to hold until I got there...<br>
    <br>
    When I did get inside, there were only two toilets - one closed, and the other with some
    girl who had drank way too much asn was being sick - I just couldn't take it so I went out
    to dance for a while...<br>
    <br>
    A fewdrinks later (maybe 5?), I was feeling much more relaxed, and was certainly
    developing an urgency to go - I went back, but there were now about 8 people waiting in
    line - most holding themselves! So I went back to dance for a while, meaning to come back
    soon...<br>
    <br>
    And that was when it happened. I was dancing with a group of girls, when one decided to
    trip over and bump me - sending me sprawling across the dance floor, flashing my panties
    at everyone who I slid past. Maybe the Scotch helped, but I also hadn't realised how
    desperate I was until my pee was pulsating out through my panties on to the dance floor!<br>
    <br>
    Embarrased as anything, I ran outside, and looked for the quietest place I could find -
    which was no where! I was already leaking again, and could feel my stockings and shoes
    getting wet - so I went to a nearby bench (no one else was there thank god), and let it
    go. I think that was one of the longest pee's in my life!<br>
    <br>
    But maybe all that drink had affected me - I was now rather turned on, and decided to go
    back in and dance for a little longer - wet panties and all! I must say that from that
    unplanned accident, I had one of the horniest times of my life! It goes to show you don't
    have to plan to pee in public to have a good time...<br>
    <br>
    Love<br>
