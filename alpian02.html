    It took only a few minutes for Marianne to return. She was dressed in casually cut, but a
    size too small jeans and a pink, wide cut tank top showing the laces and upper parts of
    her not color matching white bra. Still, the décolleté gave a good impression of her
    large breasts. Laura wondered how she was going to support her apparently heavy backpack
    for hours, the straps directly rubbing on her skin. The jeans were apparently old, since
    the zipper didn't close all the way, making the jeans bulge out a bit below the beltline.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Here I am!&quot; Marianne said, &quot;And I brought a few bottles of water and some
    food for a picnic.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay, then let's go - we have provisions, too.&quot; The women answered and together
    they set of down the road to cross the creek and enter the nearby forest.<br>
    <br>
    The time went by and all three enjoyed the nature surrounding them. The French girl tried
    to explain some peculiarities of flora and fauna they encountered - but mostly the effort
    was in vain due to lack of vocabulary Still the ladies got along quite well and everyone
    was having a good time. About an hour later they had crossed the forest and were
    approaching a meadow. Woodpiles were placed on the right side of the path and Marianne
    said that she needed to take a pee, indicating the woodpiles, which offered a good place
    to crouch behind in relative privacy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can hold on a little longer, I'm sure.&quot; Laura said, with Gillian adding,
    &quot;We only just set off and it's not even noon yet. Let's wait until we have our lunch
    break, okay?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm feeling some pressure, too&quot; she lied to comfort Marianne.<br>
    <br>
    The meadow was not very big and in its middle they encountered a crossway. They discussed
    their further direction and meanwhile got some drink. Marianne had not forgotten about her
    predicament - she felt the desire to pee was getting intense now - but she drank as the
    other woman because she knew the danger of dehydration from exercising in the summer heat.
    Continuing their hike, Laura and Gillian were eagerly making conversation with their
    French guide, making her forget her need to relieve herself. Unobtrusively, they kept
    draining their water supplies, urging Marianne to keep up with them. And she did - and if
    it was only do reduce the weight of her backpack, which was laden with four liters of
    water.<br>
    <br>
    Noon came and went by, neither of them feeling hungry owing to their high water
    consumption. Gillian felt her bladder filling rapidly and wondered how Marianne was doing.
    It turned her on to know she was reaching desperation and did not dare to ask for leave to
    take a pee. Laura had done well offering 200,- &#128;, she thought. That made sure, that
    Marianne wanted to deliver the very best service and tried to avoid upsetting them. Just
    as she was letting her fantasies seize hold of her and carry her mind away, Marianne asked
    &quot;It's almost one o'clock now - shouldn't we take a break and have lunch?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, we shouldn't forget this treat,&quot; Laura answered. &quot;I was fully
    absorbed by this beautiful nature around us.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But let's look for some nice place to sit down.&quot; Gillian suggested, wanting to
    see Marianne holding on. &quot;It's quite moist here in the forest and there is no open
    space around with some moss to sit on.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you know a nice place for a picnic?&quot; Laura demanded of their guide. &quot;I
    would like a place with some panorama rather than being caught in the forest.&quot; She
    added, thinking about the accomplishment of her secret plan.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We'll get out of the forest soon, if we take this forest track. It leads straight to
    the main road,&quot; Marianne replied, clenching her haunches tight. She was in real need
    to release her bladder contents now. And standing at the road waiting for a decision
    didn't make things better, even though she kept shifting her weight and crossing her legs
    this way or the other. Of course, the discussion took longer than normal, because of the
    language differences. They were constantly searching for the right word or explanation to
    make communication possible. Marianne had taken down her backpack to relax her shoulders,
    but mainly to have an excuse to bend down. There she was, fiddling with her backpack and
    pretending to look for something. Laura glanced at Gillian and immediately knew what was
    on her mind She felt her body shiver - this was going to be a great day. Concentrating on
    her lower body, she felt her vulva getting wet, but at the same time she realized how
    badly she had to go, too. It was time find a place to let go!<br>
    <br>
    As the women finally walked on, heading out of the forest, Marianne found herself
    twiddling with a bottle of water - her fourth. She must have taken it out of her backpack
    before putting it back on. She was getting nervous now and asked if she could have a break
    to pee. But Gillian insisted that they would be having lunch within minutes and it were
    better to wait till then.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are holding on, too.&quot; Laura said, meanwhile feeling uncomfortable herself,
    having reached the point where the desire to pee gets urgent. &quot;And we have been
    drinking as much as you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    That was not exactly true, since Marianne was well into her fourth bottle by now,
    unconsciously taking a sip every now and then to fight her growing discomfort, whilst they
    only had had three liters.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But I didn't take a pee break for four hours now.&quot; The girl exclaimed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why didn't you go before you went with us?&quot; Gillian asked, happy to hear she
    hadn't done this. &quot;But I admit, I really have to go soon, too.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because I wanted to be back before you leave, and I didn't feel the need then. But
    I'm getting desperate now. Can't we pee here? All three of us could relieve
    ourselves?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;C'mon girls, don't be silly!&quot; Laura interjected. &quot;Let's move on and find a
    place - see, upfront, there is the road and behind that road are meadows and fields,
    aren't it? That's what Marianne said, isn't it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, that's true.&quot; Marianne replied.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, then on we go!&quot; Gillian said and led the way.<br>
    <br>
    All three of them were feeling quite desperate at present. But Laura and Gillian did their
    best not to show Marianne - they didn't want her to know. And Marianne was too shy to
    openly display the state she was in. So her companions didn't realize how quickly she was
    getting close to having an accident.<br>
    <br>
    The open plain surprised them with its heat, the sun burning with full intensity from its
    zenith. &quot;It's hot here - we should not have left the wood.&quot; Gillian addressed
    Laura.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sure, there is nice place around here, a tree or a shed or the like.&quot; Laura
    turned to Marianne. &quot;And I really prefer the open view to the enclosed feeling of the
    forest.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    At this remark, Gillian suddenly knew that it was good to be here in the plains: No one
    would be able to hide to take a pee. This meant, that she probably could savour their
    guide's desperation as long as possible and considering the effect that her being a girl
    would have on Laura she would be looking forward to a wonderful evening. &quot;I don't
    like being this close to the road.&quot; she said aloud.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What's that?&quot; Laura asked after a few hundred meters.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's an old bunker from the famous 1930's Maginot Fortifications. We have some on
    our fields, too,&quot; explained Marianne.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can you visit them?&quot; Gillian was curious.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are museums, yes. But I have never been there,&quot; was the reply. &quot;All
    I know about these things is from looking after our animals - our goat likes hiding in it
    when it's too hot.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let's have a look, okay?&quot; Gillian immediately was interested. &quot;Maybe we
    could have lunch in a real bunker?&quot; She added.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sometimes they are blocked by the farmers.&quot; the French girl objected.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But at least it's cool inside.&quot; Laura said and suggested, &quot;Let's
    try!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They went the last two hundred meters and arrived at a concrete platform in the middle of
    nowhere. There was nothing but fields around, a few trees strewn here and there, one of
    them standing next to the concrete building. The tree was hiding the entrance, which was a
    curved stair leading down, and into the bunker. Walking around, the women saw that at the
    opposite side the bunker was not entirely immersed in the ground. While the field was
    slightly downward sloping, the concrete platform was level. Therefore a concrete wall was
    visible which showed a slit in the direction of Germany. From here you could observe the
    valley being far enough out of the way.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's open!&quot; exclaimed Laura, who had been going downstairs as Gillian and
    Marianne made the tour around the bunker.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cool, I wanna see it, too!&quot; Gillian answered and ushered Marianne into the
    cave.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look! There has been someone in here before.&quot; Laura explained, showing some
    unexpected findings. There were a large woollen picnic blanket, a wooden tea box, a
    folding chair and an old mattress lying in the confined room. Apart from these
    &quot;furnishings&quot; that might have belonged to a vagabond, the room was plain
    concrete walls with a floor full of concrete chunks that had broken from the building. But
    it was astonishingly dry.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oohh - I wanted to pee in here, and now there is someone living here!&quot; Marianne
    was disappointed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are we going to have lunch upstairs or here?&quot; Gillian asked, &quot;It looks
    quite comfortable here!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, good idea. Outdoors it's quite hot, even underneath the tree. And we couldn't
    really sit there, because the shadow is just on the entrance and not on the plain.&quot;
    Laura agreed. &quot;By the way, down here no one will notice us and so the farmer won't
    send us off his grounds.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So I will go upstairs and have a pee now.&quot; Marianne mentioned.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey, stay with us - we could still have our pee down here after lunch.&quot; Gillian
    suggested, &quot;It doesn't look like the owner of this place will come here
    tonight.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But we couldn't pee in someone else's place.&quot; Marianne opposed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why not?&quot; Laura inquired, &quot;I like Gillian's idea: We have lunch first and
    then we will have a pee break down here. I don't like the idea of peeing in the plain
    field - visible to everybody,&quot; and she started preparing lunch without delay.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But I really need to pee now!&quot; Marianne sounded rather hurried. &quot;So I'd
    prefer to go upstairs - I don't mind anyone watching.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Could you please hold this for me.&quot; Laura deviated, making Marianne help her
    preparing the wooden box as a table. At the same time Gillian observed, &quot;Cool to have
    these things - would have been a pretty eerie feeling in this cold and dark room
    without.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can I pee now?&quot; Marianne asked again, moving towards the door, &quot;I'll be
    right back!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, come on - we all need to pee. Let's do it together afterwards.&quot; Gillian
    replied, blocking her way to the door. &quot;It won't harm these things to get wet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She really enjoyed being able to see a girl in such a desperate need to pee - but surely
    Marianne would last through a short lunch break! It made her hot to imagine the girl
    almost peeing her pants, not daring to object to them.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne looked really shocked when she realized that Gillian was standing in her way. At
    this moment, Laura noticed the situation, remembered Gillian's sentence about the eerie
    feeling, and felt herself reminded of a middle age dungeon. Gillian was the evil
    noblewoman torturing an innocent village girl for nothing. It was such a picturesque
    situation!<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, Marianne was heading for the stairs, not hindered by Gillian.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey girls, wait!&quot; Laura shouted, &quot;I need to take a picture of this! You
    should have seen it - such a perfect snapshot! Imagine, a dark concrete room, a woman
    forcing a girl to do something... Isn't this an ideal theme for this place?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Wait, Marianne - we'll do this first!&quot; Gillian consented, secretly savouring to
    keep her again from peeing, from relieving herself. Marianne winced and turned back
    &quot;But don't take too long, please. I am absolutely desperate now!&quot; She didn't
    dare to object - she really wanted the money and considered it better not to upset the
    woman.<br>
    <br>
    When Gillian turned back, she saw that Laura had prepared all the equipment: the digital
    camcorder as well as her small camera. Also, she had put a small light into place, because
    it was quite dark inside despite the open door and the lookout slit. A look in her eyes
    made Gillian shiver with anticipation - this day was soo hot! Meanwhile, Laura saw the
    look in Marianne's face. Pure desperation and a trace of fear were visible. Gillian didn't
    know - but this really turned her on!<br>
    <br>
    She gave her instructions: &quot;Gillian, you stand here, barring the way to the stairs.
    Marianne goes here and then tries to get at the door. Marianne, you really have to pretend
    that you can't hold it any longer!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But it's true! I can't hold it any more! I need to pee! Now! I'm gonna pee my
    pants!&quot; Marianne shouted, now panic showing on her face. Gillian noticed, how Laura
    was turned on and blocked Marianne's way. They were struggling with each other, Laura
    taking pictures like crazy and filming from the wooden box.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is perfect, Marianne! You're a perfect actress! Gillian, move a bit to the
    left, I want to see your faces.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Gillian moved closer to Marianne. Their bodies were touching now. She felt a shiver in
    here spine - this game turned her on! If only she wouldn't have to pee as badly! She
    wanted to let go - but that was not part of the game. Fuck, would she be able to last
    until after the meal? Marianne probably would have to go outdoors right after the
    shooting, shot through her mind. Immediately, a wave of pleasure moistened her vulva. She
    felt her inner lips get wet. Wow, this was so great! Not to mention having Marianne also
    being on the verge of sending her pee gushing out of her bladder!<br>
    <br>
    Gillian didn't notice what she was doing. She was almost fighting with Marianne. Marianne
    couldn't understand. Why didn't they end this photo shooting? She had to go!!! But how to
    explain in English that it wasn't just for the show anymore?<br>
    <br>
    Laura now was fully immersed in her filming. Sitting in the low folding chair, she got a
    look from below. She imagined the moisture of Gillian's crotch - why did she wear black
    leggings? Marianne's tummy was so full! The waistband of her jeans cut into her untouched
    flesh. Now the girls were almost fighting! Marianne constantly screaming that she needed
    to pee: &quot;Let me go, pleeaase let me go, I pee my pants, I have to pee now!&quot;
    Suddenly, she bent over. How urgent was it really? Laura continued her thought: What if
    Marianne had an accident in front of her camera! A wave of heat streamed through her body.
    It excited her to know Marianne was on the verge of breaking. She wanted to know when; she
    was looking forward to the moment that it would happen. But than, it was only a game,
    played for a series of holiday pictures. She probably was playing it harder than it was.
    Now, look at that: When Marianne straightened up again, she got stuck under Gillian's arm.
    How close the girls were. Laura felt her bladder ache - her bladder didn't want to hold
    back any longer. She needed to pee so desperately, too! If only - but no...<br>
    <br>
    Gillian and Marianne were in a real struggle now. One moment, Marianne had bent down. Was
    that a trick? Gillian moved closer and held her arm ready to wrap around Marianne.
    Marianne begged to let her go - she was a good actress, really. But then, she had all the
    help she needed provided by her aching bladder. Marianne moved again. Did she want to duck
    under her arms? Her arm was ready! She put it across Marianne's back; it got entangled in
    her garments. She felt the warm skin, the soft touch of Marianne's body. It felt really
    good!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Perfect, now, show your faces!&quot; Laura interrupted Gillian's thoughts.<br>
    <br>
    Gillian got hold of Marianne and turned her towards the camera. Marianne had lost her
    power, her will, she was just pleading in looks and words to be allowed to go and pee NOW.
    Why didn't these women understand, that she wasn't playing anymore?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Marianne, you look perfect - the living plea for mercy.&quot; Laura directed:
    &quot;Gillian, I wanna see a bit more viciousness.<br>
    <br>
    It was such a wonderful situation! What was that? The laces of Marianne's top seemed to be
    sliding down her arm, making her look even more vulnerable. Her entangled hair, her facial
    expression, the top seemingly coming of, showing more skin than usual...<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Very good! Can you move the laces on this side a bit further down to the elbows? How
    daring!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Whilst Laura ordered this, Gillian was not shy to make it happen. She still held her arm
    around Marianne, both standing almost side by side, looking into the camera. Marianne's
    laces had slipped of her shoulder, but she didn't take notice. She was too preoccupied
    with her aching need to pee! She almost wanted to let go right there - but she didn't have
    clothes to change - and the humiliation! With her free arm, Gillian moved in front of
    Marianne and carefully pulled her top's laces further down - almost to the elbow.
    Immediately, her top slipped down, uncovering her bra on the right side. Laura got up to
    get a closer view with her camera, zooming in at Marianne's breasts, her décolleté, her
    bra; then again showing the whole bust and her agonized face. Unfortunately for Marianne,
    when she had bent down and Gillian's arm had got entangled with her clothes, it almost had
    ripped open her bra. Now, as she struggled to get loose, the last fiber gave way. Her bra
    was only covering her right breast now, because its lace still held on close to her
    shoulder.<br>
    <br>
    Laura was excited. This was the best video she had ever made, ever dreamt of making!
    French girls were really special!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, move your fingers along her décolleté again!&quot; She summoned Gillian. And
    Gillian was excited to do so. &quot;You need to look meaner - yes!&quot; Gillian's
    fingertips were gliding up to Marianne's shoulder, gently pushing the bra further down her
    breast.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Wow, you're daring, Marianne!&quot; exclaimed Laura, &quot;Take your fingers off -
    yes, I can see your breast, wow, that's big!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The bra had slipped down far enough to reveal part of the areola of her breast. This
    excited Laura. She zoomed in very close: &quot;Can you move the laces a bit further down,
    still?&quot; she demanded at Gillian.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Like this?&quot; Gillian let her fingers slip under the laces and pulled them down
    millimetre by millimetre. Even though the bra was loose now, it clang to the nipple and
    didn't reveal any more - but in a more provoking manner. Gillian caressed the exposed
    breast, a bitchy, vicious smile on her face - perfect for the movie. When her fingers
    reached the nipple, she gently caressed the areola, and then levied the bra out of place,
    exposing the nipple to the camera.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Marianne, you are so wonderful, I shouldn't have thought you would do that for
    us!&quot; Laura praised.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly, Marianne bent down again, driven by a sudden urge to pee. A small spurt escaped
    her urethra. She panicked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let me go!!!&quot; She screamed, &quot;I have to PEE NOW!!!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    But screaming was too much for her bladder - she had to stop it before she pissed herself
    in front of the camera. Laura had sat down again, first filming the dangling breast and
    the exposed décolleté, then only observing Marianne's outburst. Was there a bit of
    darker fabric appearing in her crotch?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You should open the button of your jeans.&quot; Gillian advised her, &quot;That
    takes the pressure off your bladder.&quot; and did it at the same time.<br>
    <br>
    Since the zipper already was halfway down, the more than taut jeans burst open and exposed
    a big part of white cotton panties. Wow, this was erotic! Laura felt her pee surge to her
    opening when she zoomed in on Marianne's panties. It was the right moment. Marianne
    couldn't hold it anymore. Suddenly, she gave a loud sob and a big dark spot spread over
    her crotch. She couldn't hold on anymore. She felt a sudden spasm go through her lower
    body; her bladder contracted and let go of a spurt of pee. She clenched her urethra shut,
    but too late, a few drops had found their way out. She had to relax a bit - but
    immediately, another spurt, more than a few drops, moistened her vulva, her inner lips,
    pushed past her clitoris and wet her panties. Moments later, another spurt completely
    soaked her white cotton panties, a little rivulet leaking down her inner leg. Now her
    jeans got soaked by a longer, stronger spurt finding its way out of her bladder; down her
    urethra and through her entangled lips. She finally realized what was happening to her -
    she was peeing herself in front of those women! She started to sob and sank to the ground.
    Ashamed. Wishing, not to be there. Feeling her warm pee soak her jeans completely. Her pee
    kept streaming. Meanwhile, she sat on the mattress and leaned on the wall, Gillian sitting
    at her side, hugging her, gently caressing her side.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm so sorry, we didn't want you to pee yourself.&quot; Gillian said. &quot;I would
    have let you go, if I had known!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    This made Marianne feel even worse; did she really have to blame herself? Was it her fault
    that she had peed her pants? Should she have been more definite? How could she have
    avoided this humiliation? Now, she was sitting there, her pee still dripping out of her
    bladder, a whole puddle of pee under her ass.<br>
    <br>
    Laura was still filming. She got a straight look into Marianne's crotch, which sat there,
    in front of her, with her legs open a bit so her wet haunches wouldn't touch. She had seen
    everything. The first spreading of moisture, the pee colouring the bleached jeans fabric
    in a hue of yellow, the jeans starting to drop and finally the gush of pee forcing its way
    out when the two ladies sat on the mattress and the fabric clung closely to Marianne's
    most private parts. The whole cave smelled like fresh pee now, only a light odor, but
    still noticeable. Laura was terribly turned on. At the same time, she needed to pee - now!
    But she already knew, what to do.<br>
