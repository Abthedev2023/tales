    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#000000"><strong>Most of this story is true. The
    main part of it (the desperation and wetting) was emailed to me by a very close girl
    friend in the USA, last year for Valentine's day. I asked her if she would mind if I made
    it into a story, and post it, and she said she would be delighted.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#000000"><strong>I wrote a story round it, and made
    it the second episode in my &quot;Linda's accidents&quot; series. (I posted the first one
    on here not so long ago)</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#000000"><strong>The clothes she was wearing, the
    desperation and the wetting is 100% true - I've just altered the location, and some of the
    other details. The girl Linda is fictitious, of course, as I wouldn't dream of disclosing
    the real girl's name.</strong></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Linda and three friends decided to go to
    the local nightclub one Saturday night. Linda looked absolutely stunning. She was wearing
    a nearly see-through white blouse, a zebra velvet mini skirt, sheer black tights, and knee
    high patent leather lace-up high heeled boots.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She was knocking the drinks back fast and
    furious, and after about an hour, her head was feeling very fuzzy. Her three friends got
    up to dance, but Linda wasn't bothered at that moment, so she sat and looked after their
    coats and bags, and watched their seats while they were gone.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">They were gone for quite a while, and she
    needed to wee really bad. This wasn't a fetish thing, or something she was enjoying, but
    she couldn't get up to go to the loo because she didn't want to lose their seats or stop
    watching their stuff. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">By the time they got back, she thought she
    was going to burst, especially when she stood up in those high heels and short skirt, she
    got shivers up her legs and she thought she was going to wee herself right there at the
    table, but she made it to the toilet, which was right across from the center of the front
    bar.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">When she got there, there were two girls in
    line. Two wasn't so bad normally, but she was panic stricken. Although she loved wetting
    herself, she didn't want to do it in the middle of her favorite nightclub. She just kept
    thinking about how humiliating it would be if she totally lost it. When she was next, she
    was totally doing the pee dance, but her head was spinning, and she could barely keep her
    balance. She felt hot little bursts in her knickers, and thought she was going to cry. She
    figured it served her right, for being so into &quot;accidents&quot;, and now she was
    going to have one, a real one, at the worst possible time. She felt snakes of hot wee
    winding their way down her tights, leaving glistening streaks down her shiny boots. She
    tried to clench up without holding herself because she didn't want her skirt to get wet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She was still weeing when she finally got
    into the door, and she didn't even lock it, she just stood over the toilet and weed
    through her underwear and tights into the toilet. At least that way it was just a stream
    straight out of her crotch into the toilet instead of her weeing all down her legs as she
    tried to get her tights and knickers down. It didn't take her long to finish, as she'd
    done quite a lot of it while waiting for the toilet. She reached over and locked the door.
    She took lots of toilet paper and dried her boots, and patted herself dry, and used the
    hand dryer to blow her crotch and legs mostly dry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">No one ever knew, but when she rejoined her
    friends, one of them said &quot;You've been a long time Linda, what have you been doing,
    making your will?&quot; Linda just laughed and explained that there was a bit of a queue.
    When she got home afterwards, she couldn't go to sleep without first rubbing herself, and
    thinking about what she had done, and how naughty she had been.</font></p>
