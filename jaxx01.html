    <br>
    On a warm, calm spring evening, Steph decides to go for a bike ride. There are no good
    bike trails around her house so she drives to a trail entrance, parks, and takes out her
    bike. Pushing her long, blonde hair out of view, she gets on and begins to ride. She
    hasn't been out for a couple weeks and it feels good. Her athletic, 23-year old body
    responds well to her vigorous pedalling and she speeds along, aerodynamic in a relatively
    thick purple cycling bib with a tight long-sleeve purple and black shirt over top.<br>
    <br>
    She remembers that she probably should have gone to the bathroom before leaving, but she
    thinks that she'll have to learn to hold her bladder if she wants to do well in serious
    long-distance races. She coasts over a long flat, forest expanse with the river off to one
    side, far below an embankment. She arrives at a long hill and starts to build up a sweat,
    her quads beginning to burn with the steep climb, the river audibly coursing along beneath
    her. Reaching a brief plateau, she unclips her large water bottle, knowing that she has to
    stay hydrated, despite the now menacing whirring of the river taunting her bladder. She
    takes a long drink while coasting and then continues.<br>
    <br>
    She shifts to a standing posture to continue the climb and really focuses on her
    pedalling, thinking of all the training she has ahead of her. She's definitely beginning
    to feel tired and her bladder now has a constant, dull ache. She adjusts her C-cup sports
    bra to concentrate on anything other than her growing urge. She pauses to consider a brief
    break to pee, but she doesn't want to risk being exposed in the forest when she has to
    take off her one-piece. How far is it to the next populated area? She realizes that she'll
    have no choice but to stop as soon as the forest ends. She remembers that it's one of the
    longer trail systems, but figures that a bathroom must be near, even though she can't
    remember having been on this particular trail before.<br>
    <br>
    She continues to pedal hard and she begins to feel a bit damp with sweat all over, but
    more so between her legs. She has been trying not to focus on her bladder, but she's
    pretty certain that it is just sweat. She waits for a group of three male cyclists to pass
    her, going in the opposite direction, knowing that they would check her out. She gazes
    down at her perfect thighs and is surprised to see a small wet patch on her crotch. She
    reaches her small, tanned hand down to her thigh and confirms that it's definitely not
    just sweat. Beginning to panic a bit, decides that she can't be far from a bathroom, and
    pedals even harder.<br>
    <br>
    Aches now come in serious waves, and she realizes that she must have drunk two litres of
    water over the last couple hours. She remembers her junior high science teacher saying
    that most bladders have a max capacity of one liter and that after that, things just
    &quot;happen&quot; by reflex. What did he know though- he was wrong about enough other
    things she later studied at college. Right or wrong, she waited for a female jogger to
    pass by and was alarmed to see her patch spread as she felt a gush escape. Her face turned
    bright red as she realized that she was having an accident. She finally crossed into an
    urban area, which had to have a bathroom, unable to keep her speed up. She saw that it
    looked busy though, and her purple tights were a visible shade darker in a spreading
    patch, and her beautiful butt felt soaked. She was still fighting to keep control, but
    realized that she couldn't go into the busy shop dripping with pee and would have to try
    to get back around the looping path to her car... and then home.<br>
    <br>
    This was a disaster- could she make it? She just focused on the pedalling, trying to just
    get to the car and worry about her embarrassment later. Her urge to pee went away after
    about ten minutes and she looked down to find that the warm night had made her patch less
    visible- and it hadn't moved too far down her thigh! She thought that she might be okay
    and kept pedalling, thinking that this must happen to serious cyclers all the time- it was
    barely any pee.<br>
    <br>
    Resuming her quick pace, determined to get back to her sporty blue coupe, she thought of a
    training schedule and believed she was winning her fight to keep the intermittent pain of
    her bladder out of mind. She felt a strange tingling sensation in her spine and worried
    that she was over-exerting herself. Slowing down slightly, she felt the (wonderful)
    sensation of her legs growing really warm. She looked down in horror to realize that she
    was peeing her pants uncontrollably. A male cyclist passed by and she heard
    &quot;whoa!&quot; as he receded into the distance, turning his head to gaze back around at
    the pretty girl flooding the trail, on the verge of tears.<br>
    <br>
    As a male and female jogging group came into view up ahead, she tried to stop the flow of
    slightly hissing pee with all her strength. Strangely, she was completely unable to regain
    control, but realized that the harder she tried to stop, the more she felt... extreme
    pleasure in her lower body and rising up into her core. Shocked at this strange response
    and trying not to enjoy it, she focused on regaining control before the joggers ahead.
    Finally, the gusher began to taper off, but as the joggers came near, she saw the stunned
    looks on their faces. A trail of pee had been coming off her bike and her tights were
    completely soaked, her pink and white shoes drenched. She tried to speed up but heard one
    of the male joggers yell, &quot;are you okay?&quot; after her.<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, people seemed to disappear from the trail, as she got deeper into the
    forested area. Her heart was racing and she was stunned. Finally, her thoughts turned to
    the nearly orgasmic feeling she had while she was trying to regain control, and of the
    wonderful warmth she felt. She looked down to find that her tights, now semi-transparent,
    betrayed the outline of her pretty pink thong-like underwear and she couldn't help
    realizing that she had to look pretty hot...<br>
    <br>
    She decided that she'd go biking again soon, maybe with her friend Sara, who was home on
    break from her modelling tour. She remembered kissing Sara the same night that the other
    blonde looked at her with gorgeous hazel eyes after they'd shared a few drinks and said,
    &quot;I think I wet my jeans.&quot; Maybe they could explore her new feelings about pee
    together.<br>
