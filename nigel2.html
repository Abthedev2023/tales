      <P align="left" class="storyteller">Barbara's Agony</P>
      <P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
      <P>When Barbara&#146;s date suggested a coffee back at his place she really 
        wasn&#146;t sure she should accept. They had just spent a very happy couple 
        of hours in a bar just chatting and although it wasn&#146;t their first 
        date she was not sure she was ready for the next step in their relationship. 
        Anyway before she knew it she had accepted and she found herself standing 
        to leave with him. </P>
      <P>Standing reminded her that she could really do with a wee. Her bladder 
        felt uncomfortably full beneath her short skirt but with her boyfriend 
        set to leave plus the fact she didn&#146;t know where the loo&#146;s were 
        and was too afraid to ask, she resigned herself to wait until she got 
        back to his place. The short walk to the car park saw her trotting next 
        to him with her arms folded across her chest to keep out the chill night 
        air. In the car she was grateful for the warm heater blowers immediately 
        springing into action but in truth all she could think about now was finding 
        a loo. She was almost having to cross her legs now she was getting so 
        desperate but she had to content herself by squeezing her thighs tight 
        together and hoping he didn&#146;t notice her growing need. Occasionally 
        she let one of her hands stray towards her crotch and she was able to 
        press slightly to ease the pressure.</P>
      <P>The journey back took around fifteen minutes. By this time Barbara was 
        biting her lip in her anxiety and shifting ever so slightly on her bum 
        as the ache in her bladder got so much stronger. She tried to think how 
        much she&#146;d had to drink that night and knew it was too much. After 
        the first three halves of shandy and the diet coke she lost count as her 
        bladder again reminded her that she needed a loo, and she needed one right 
        now!</P>
      <P>Her date, ever the gentleman, swiftly scooted round to her side as soon 
        as he had parked the car and opened the door for her. Barbara was aching 
        to tell him that she needed a pee but somehow the words just wouldn&#146;t 
        come. Walking up the steps outside his block of flats she could feel herself 
        clenching her buttocks and she instinctively held her purse in front of 
        her crutch for fear of having an accident. They walked inside together 
        and he lead her upstairs to the second floor and then along a dimly lit 
        but expensively decorated corridor until they were stood outside his front 
        door.</P>
      <P>Barbara paused patiently while he unlocked the door. Inside, as he flicked 
        on the light switch, Barbara gasped as it opened into a huge living room, 
        fronted by large bay windows leading onto a small balcony. The room had 
        a pine floor with the occasional rug, a large open fireplace with a massive 
        sofa nearby. She was taken aback by the awesome sight of this superbly 
        equipped flat, sparsely furnished but that just made the whole place look 
        bigger. There were just enough paintings on the wall and bookcases not 
        to make the place look too bare.</P>
      <P>She hardly noticed her date asking for her coat. She slipped it off and 
        he hung it on a stand by the door while she gazed around. She was really 
        trying to seek out the bathroom but there didn&#146;t seem to be one. 
      </P>
      <P>&quot;What a place,&quot; Barbara said, &quot;I&#146;m impressed, but 
        you&#146;ve just got to tell me where your loo is,&quot; she added with 
        new found confidence, &quot;I&#146;m absolutely bursting!&quot; She said 
        bending her knees in towards her crotch.</P>
      <P>&quot;Okay,&quot; he said, &quot;Let me just put the coffee on and I&#146;ll 
        give you a guided tour, not that there&#146;s much else to see.&quot;</P>
      <P>Barbara blushed. She needed a pee NOW and prayed he wouldn&#146;t take 
        too long putting the coffee on. She followed him across the living room 
        to the far corner where an archway led straight into a large kitchen. 
        She paused, leaning against one of the units while he fussed around filling 
        a jug with water and setting the coffee on to brew. Just before the archway 
        she had spotted a small flight of twisting open iron stairs which surely 
        lead up to the bedroom and the bathroom. God she hoped so! Her bladder 
        felt so swollen she could feel it stretching to meet her tummy button. 
        God she needed to go sooo badly! She hadn&#146;t needed a pee this badly 
        for ages.</P>
      <P>Her date walked over towards her and to Barbara&#146;s alarm he reached 
        his arms around her and planted a big kiss on her lips. She responded 
        slightly but could feel herself trying to twist her legs together as she 
        did so. It was a good thirty seconds before she managed to break free 
        and gasp, &quot;That was really nice, but I really do have to pee so badly!&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Really?&quot; he said, pressing against her and letting one of 
        his hands drift to her stomach where he felt her bladder as hard as iron, 
        &quot;Mmmmm, you DO have to go don&#146;t you?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;God yes!!&quot; Barbara murmured back, now becoming so turned-on 
        as he felt between her legs and their lips met in another sweet kiss. 
        Her breathing quickened and her heart raced at the prospect of going further 
        with this guy, but also with the massive effort it was taking to stop 
        herself from peeing in her knickers. &quot;Please let me go.&quot; She 
        begged, &quot;I&#146;ll be all yours if you would just let me pee first.&quot;</P>
      <P>He lifted her onto the unit, sweeping away any objects in her path. Her 
        skirt rose above her thighs and exposed her white skimpy underwear. As 
        he parted her thighs Barbara could feel them quivering as her bladder 
        threatened to explode. He was feeling along the line of her knickers now, 
        almost as if he wanted her to pee herself. Then it hit her, he really 
        did want her to let go! She couldn&#146;t, not in front of a man, she 
        just couldn&#146;t. She vowed to try and hang on as best she could but 
        it was becoming increasingly difficult. Her bladder was literally bursting 
        at the seams and she doubted she could wait more than a couple of minutes 
        now.</P>
      <P>As his fingers started to edge inside her knickers to her waiting, moist 
        pussy she was squealing in frustration. Again she begged him to let her 
        go and this time he relented and allowed her to stand up. He led her back 
        into the living room and started showing her round. Barbara could barely 
        contain herself. She had one hand lodged firmly against her crotch as 
        he showed her the balcony and then his collection of artwork adorning 
        the walls. Again she had to remind him how desperate she was and to her 
        relief he at last made towards the iron staircase and led her upstairs.</P>
      <P>Barbara was on the point of wetting herself as she reached the landing. 
        She could feel a jet of wee just poised on the very edge of her urethra 
        and it was taking all her strength to hold it in. They passed two fairly 
        large bedrooms and that was it. No bathroom! Barbara could hardly believe 
        it. She was in agony and could feel tears whelling up inside her, &quot;Please,&quot; 
        she sobbed &quot;I have GOT to pee NOW!! Where is your bathroom?&quot;</P>
      <P>He turned and looked at her as she stood on the landing, bending forward 
        and rubbing between her legs and hopping from one foot to the other. He 
        smiled as she grimaced and squeezed herself harder still. &quot;This way.&quot; 
        He said finally and steered her back into the larger of the two bedrooms. 
        &quot;Take off your clothes.&quot; He said while sitting on the bed and 
        watching her standing there. Barbara almost fainted with embarrassment 
        but she would do anything now just to squat and allow her torture to end. 
        She struggled out of her blouse and skirt and kicked off her shoes, still 
        frantically pacing up and down. &quot;And the rest.&quot; He said eyeing 
        her underwear. The bulge of her bladder stretched tight across her knickers. 
        She unclipped her bra, surprised to see her nipples so hard and erect, 
        but as her concentration wavered for just that split second she suddenly 
        felt a squirt of wee escape her. She gasped with shame and embarrassment 
        as she felt her knickers dampen. Too late she reached a hand back to her 
        crotch and pressed hard against the small wet patch.</P>
      <P>Now she&#146;d started her bladder wanted more, much more, and she could 
        only stand there moaning out loud as her pee started to slip agonisingly 
        through her fingers and down the inside of her thighs. Her date pulled 
        her gently towards him and slowly inched down her rapidly soaking knickers. 
        Her pussy glistened with wetness as she managed to bring herself back 
        under control. He started to undress and pulled her onto the bed on top 
        of him. He was very hard and before Barbara could utter a word of protest 
        he was inside her and she was bouncing down on top of him. The feeling 
        of him filling her pussy with her bladder still so incredibly full was 
        indescribable. She had never known such ecstasy wash through her like 
        a relentless tidal wave of passion. As she came he did too and before 
        she knew it she was peeing uncontrollably down his shaft, curving round 
        his balls and slipping across his stomach. She still had to go so bad 
        and although feeling total embarrassment, she just allowed herself to 
        go, pushing hard to release every ounce of her pee over him. &quot;Serve 
        him right!&quot; she thought, but deep down they were both loving every 
        minute of it!</P>
