      Story</strong><br>
      <br><br>You think you know 
      yourself well and feel that you understand what makes you tick and then 
      something happens that makes you think again<br><br>About a month ago I 
      joined some friends on a Friday night in London for a drink and to say 
      'goodbye' to a work colleague who was was leaving. I'd dressed casually 
      for the night in light coloured jeans, a loose top and a cotton jacket. 
      The evening started out quietly and gradually became noisy and fun without 
      being rowdy. I'd started drinking with someone who seemed keen and I was 
      happy to share some of the evening with him.<br><br>We drank wine and I 
      always drink water with it to dilute the potential hangover. At about 
      eleven I had to leave to catch a train home and I said goodbye to everyone 
      and parted. The temperature had dropped more than I anticipated from 
      earlier in the evening and I set off quickly to the Tube 
      Station.<br><br>There was a slight delay with the train but it arrived and 
      was very crowded. I got on and moved inside to allow a few more people 
      into the carriage. The train pulled out and I stood trying like everyone 
      else not to look at the people around me. I needed to pee which surprised 
      me as I had been about thirty minutes before I left the party but it was 
      probably due to being cold when on the way to the station. I was not too 
      concerned. The train stopped at the first two stations and the next was 
      mine. It pulled away and then stopped in the tunnel. Nobody said anything 
      and everyone just stood staring vacantly into empty spaces. The silence 
      lasted for a few minutes and then quiet exasperation became slightly vocal 
      as people wondered what was going on. I stood looking around and could 
      feel the pressure on my bladder building. After another five minutes there 
      was a message to say that we would be at the next station in about five 
      minutes as they were moving a train that had broken down and apologised 
      for the delay. I very discreetly pressed my legs together and tried not 
      think about the need to pee. <br><br>The 'five minutes' seemed like twenty 
      and I tried not to move though I was conscious that I was fidgeting, I 
      kept touching my hair and looking at my watch. I slowly crossed my legs. 
      Nobody could notice as the carriage was too crowded.<br><br>When the train 
      finally moved it surprised me and I gently put my hand between my legs and 
      squeezed slightly. I was feeling quite desperate but was confident now 
      that the train was moving that I would be okay. The train moved slowly and 
      kept stopping and for the first time I now started to worry. I kept 
      looking down and crossed my legs tighter.<br><br>The train finally pulled 
      into the station. <br><br>I started to move with the crowd of people 
      getting off the train. I moved awkwardly as I could feel a pressure on my 
      bladder I had not felt for a long time and made for the escalator. I 
      wanted to walk up to get to the top quicker but chose to stay still as I 
      felt it might be safer. I suddenly felt a sharp pain between my legs and 
      felt a warm sensation in my my pants. I brought the flow under controI and 
      quickly looked down. I was shocked to see a small wet stain on my jeans 
      and put my hand between my legs hoping that nobody would notice. I knew I 
      had to try to find the toilets as I sensed that as soon as I had released 
      the first time I would struggle to hold the rest.<br><br>I walked as 
      quickly as I dared to the ticket barriers and despite my hands shaking 
      managed to put the ticket into the gate and went through. I walked down 
      the tunnel towards the Main Line Station and held my purse in front of me 
      which I thought might conceal the stain.&nbsp; <br><br>I reached the 
      stairs leading up to the station and very carefully started to climb them. 
      People were rushing past me as I could not move too quickly. I felt 
      another sudden pain and almost stopped as I felt another warm flow of pee 
      in my pants which was bigger than last time. I put my hand behind my back 
      to cover my bottom and between my legs which I couldn't see but felt 
      wet.<br><br>I got to the top of the stairs and knew by this time that I 
      was wet both at the front and the back and just hoped that people wouldn't 
      notice. I was desperate to find the toilet even though I was wet as I knew 
      there was more to come and my ability to hold on had almost gone.<br><br>I 
      walked into the Station concourse. People were making their way to their 
      trains heading home and I made my way towards the toilets. I kept my eyes 
      and mind focused on walking in a straight line whilst I held on to my pee. 
      I walked slowly through the crowd past some people staring up at the 
      Destination Boards. I could feel my muscles losing the fight to contain 
      the inevitable flow and suddenly I started to pee. I tried to contain it 
      as I had done before but could feel the pee now pouring uncontrollably 
      into my knickers and I stood still and watched as the wetness spread on my 
      jeans from my crotch down my legs and into a puddle forming at my 
      feet.<br><br>I was shaking. People were looking at me and I felt totally 
      embarrassed as well as helpless. There was nothing I could do. I tried not 
      to look at anybody and made my way towards the platform where my train 
      would be. My legs were soaked and made a noise as they rubbed together 
      when I walked and I was leaving a small trail of pee in my wake as it 
      dripped from my trousers.<br><br>People started to notice the stains down 
      my legs, looking, pointing and sometimes smiling at their colleagues as I 
      passed. I got to the gate for my train and waited to one side by a wall 
      hoping to be less conspicuous. The train was shown as ready and I joined 
      the queue to get on the train. I saw a container with free newspapers and 
      grabbed the last few. I then held them in front of me as I went through 
      the barrier hoping to cover up my wetness as much as possible.<br><br>I 
      got into a carriage which was&nbsp; not too crowded and put the newspapers 
      onto a vacant seat and sat down on them.<br><br>Nobody sat next to me and 
      the train pulled away. After about four stops the guard came through the 
      carriage asking for the tickets. She stopped next to me and I fumbled 
      through my purse looking for mine. She looked at my jeans and then at me. 
      'Have you..?' I interupted. 'Please, I've put newspaper on the seat. It's 
      not wet', I said quietly.<br><br>She looked at my ticket and then at me. 
      'I've seen a lot worse. At least you put the papers there.'<br><br>I 
      thanked her and she smiled. 'Never mind'. Then she moved away.<br><br>When 
      the train pulled into my station I left it as late as possible to get up 
      from the seat. I picked up the newspapers and quickly got off and then 
      waited until everyone else had left the platform. I threw the papers in a 
      bin and went through to the ticket barrier. The ticket collector looked me 
      up and down. 'You've had a good night', he said smiling.<br><br>When I 
      came out of the station there were a few taxis but I knew none of them 
      would take me so I walked home. The wetness was now very cold on my legs. 
      I finally turned the corner for my flat and and stooped and peed again 
      into my trousers. The spreading warmth was now comforting.<br><br>When I got in I ran a bath and 
      then washed myself before climbing in. I laid in the fragrant water and 
      replayed in mind the events of the night. My fingers moved deftly between 
      my legs and I knew that I had done something that had been one of my worse 
      nightmares but which had now been a taboo that had been broken.<br><br><strong>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne
