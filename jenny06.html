    Slacks</strong><br>
    <br>
    I never thought that ripping a pair of pants could be a good thing! I came to work this
    morning, and then went in for a pee - looked down, and there was a gaping hold in my
    slacks! The first thing I did was start to walk funny, and then made a lame excuse to get
    an hour of work to go to the city and get a replacement pair real fast. I went into town
    and got the new pair, and then had a wild idea - I had never wet myself in a pair of pants
    in public before! I always wear a skirt so the pee can come out without showing too bad.
    And since I had a spare pair now, I got excited and thought this would be a great idea. <br>
    <br>
    First I went to the food hall and got the largest coke I could find - I kind of already
    needed to go, but thought to top it up. I then went and got a new pair of panties and was
    ready. First I tried to pee just standing on an escalator, but found I just could not get
    it out - I was too nervous. So I got another coke and went and sat down in front of the
    cinema, and relaxed. The first spurts came out, and I could see a patch in my pants, but
    froze up again when I saw a bit drip on the floor! Too nervous about people seeing me! <br>
    <br>
    Finally I went into Myer, cause it is so big. I went to the lingerie section, squatted
    down as if I was looking at something and let most of it go... I left a huge patch on the
    carpet and my slacks and panties were soaked. I then went and could let the rest go on the
    escalator (There was someone in front of me too - but no one behind) <br>
    <br>
    I was now completely excited, and being a quiet time of day (9:30 in the morning) I walked
    to the other end of the mall, in my wet slacks, before going to a toilet and changing. I
    had completely soaked myself and walked through the mall all wet! Damn it was exciting,
    and my heart is still racing when I think about what I did. <br>
    <br>
    Gee it is fun taking a risk like that - especially a wet risk... I don't know If I will be
    able to bring myself to do it again soon though, but it was worth every minute... </font><font
