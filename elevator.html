      <P class="storyteller">The Elevator</P>
      <P> Mike walked into Jan&#146;s office; she&#146;d been expecting him and 
        had been saving her pee for most of the morning. It&#146;s a little later 
        than her usual lunch time, but she&#146;s arranged to take a late lunch 
        because she&#146;s meeting a friend from out of town. He&#146;s been holding 
        his pee too, though not as long, and he feel the pressure as he greets 
        her, cordially but not passionately because her office mate is there. 
        They leave her office and head for the elevator. <BR>
        The door opens and they step in. As it closes, leaving them alone, he 
        looks at her and grins, giving his semi-hard penis a little tweak. She 
        grins back, raising one knee and crossing it in front of the other.<BR>
        <BR>
        A dump truck full of gravel rumbles down a street several blocks away, 
        headed for a construction site. As it rolls into the site it hits a jagged 
        chunk of concrete, blowing its worn front tire. Out of control, it careens 
        into a utility pole, snapping it like a matchstick. The power lines snap 
        like rubber bands.<BR>
        <BR>
        The lights in the office building dim and die, and the elevator grinds 
        to a halt. The emergency light blinks on, and they stand there, wondering 
        how long this outage might last. In his own office building, outages are 
        so common that he keeps a flashlight in his desk drawer, but they&#146;re 
        usually brief. He glances at his watch. It&#146;s about 1:30. <BR>
        <BR>
        He opens the door but it&#146;s midway between floors, and the outer doors 
        are out of reach. The phone is dead. They&#146;re stuck.<BR>
        <BR>
        For a while, they engage in desultory conversation, trying to distract 
        themselves and each other from the increasing pressure in out bladders.&nbsp; 
        They had both been anticipating a walk in the park and eventual relief, 
        not<BR>
        an involuntary wait in a stalled elevator . . . <BR>
        <BR>
        Before too long, she admits that she has to pee. This both arouses and 
        distresses him, because if she lets fly in there, there&#146;ll be no 
        concealing it, and further, they&#146;ll be confined with the aroma, which 
        isn&#146;t too bad<BR>
        unconfined, but in this close space . . . . he remains in denial for a 
        while, but finally admits that he&#146;s in the same boat as herself, 
        and they both laugh softly, not wanting to laugh too hard because that 
        makes it harder to hold on. He glances at his watch. It&#146;s about 2:00. 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        For a while, they lean against the walls of the elevator, pressing their 
        legs together, trying to contain and minimize the growing discomfort in 
        their groins. This wasn&#146;t what he was anticipating, darn it! Seeing 
        her hips twitch and squirm, and seeing she biting her lip, has the combined 
        effect of increasing his own discomfort and his arousal. The two make 
        a very strange combination, one that would be welcome under different 
        circumstances . . . <BR>
        <BR>
        She crosses her legs, and leans forward a little. he does the same, though 
        it does him little good. Once in a while he presses on the front of his 
        penis, which seems to ease the urge for a moment or two. They&#146;re 
        breathing<BR>
        shallowly, trying to keep all the pressures as low as possible. He glances 
        at his watch. It&#146;s about 2:30.<BR>
        <BR>
        He starts to scan the floor, and notices that there seems to be a section 
        of carpet that&#146;s a different color. he kneels by it and probes around 
        its edges with his pocket knife. It peels up and he find a tiny opening, 
        covered by a panel, in the floor. Fumbling with the blade of the knife, 
        he manages to unscrew the bolts holding it in place and remove it. It&#146;s 
        an access panel for the cable, big enough to reach through but not to 
        fall through. He looks at her and nods toward the hole. She shakes her 
        head. He shrugs and sits back against the wall, his legs stretched out 
        in front of him and crossed. From there he can actually see up her skirt. 
        His penis is fairly screaming for relief, but he don&#146;t feel right 
        letting she continue to suffer while he relieves himself. He glances at 
        his watch. It&#146;s about 3:00.<BR>
        <BR>
        But finally he can take it no longer. Standing, he steps astride of the 
        hole and takes his penis out. He has to lean forward to aim it at the 
        hole, and only after some pushing can he get the pee started, but soon 
        it&#146;s flowing down the hole. The only sound, at first, is the very 
        faint hiss as it shoots out, but when the pee finally reaches the bottom 
        of the elevator shaft, several stories down, the distinctive trickling 
        noise floats up through the hole. With a murmured complaint, she claps 
        her hand over her groin, but it&#146;s too late, the pee is trickling 
        down her legs. She steps up to the hole, forcing him to step back. As 
        he continues to pee into the hole, angling his stream to hit it, she squats 
        over it and lets her pee flow through her panties and into the hole, her 
        stream mingling with his.<BR>
        <BR>
        He finishes before she does, and steps back from the hole, fascinated 
        by her continuation. With a look of profound relief, she pushes out the 
        last couple of squirts and stands up, pulling her panties off and dropping 
        them into the hole. They look at each other and laugh, then embrace, their 
        relieved bladders now relishing the pressure from outside.<BR>
        <BR>
        He replaces the cover over the hole, leaving the screws out, and flips 
        the carpet back into place. They sit side by side now, softly kissing 
        and caressing, until the lights abruptly come back on and the elevator 
        resumes its journey to the ground floor. He glances at his watch. It&#146;s 
        about 3:30.<BR>
        <BR>
        They exit with reasonable composure and head for the park, not sure what 
        they will do, but certain to enjoy their walk!</P>
