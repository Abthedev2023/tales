    <br>
    Hi, my name is Jenny, I am 28 and now an ex trolley dolly (air hostess). My story starts
    when I was working for a major UK airline. Our flight was due to depart at 10.30am local
    time but due to a technical fault in the toilet dump valve. This is the valve that opens
    to the atmosphere and allows all the waste to be dropped over the ocean on long hall
    flights. Nowadays this system is illegal and has been replaced by a modern self-contained
    system. After a two-hour delay we finally boarded the passengers and made them
    comfortable. During this time I noticed that I needed to pee, after all I had been without
    a toilet for about 3 hours but as always I ignored the feeling and carried on with my
    duties. As a rule after about an hour or so people settle down into the flight and stop
    asking all those silly questions which gives the hostess a little time to look after
    herself. However, this flight was not one of ease. Every two seconds or so someone would
    push the attendant button and as well trained hostesses we would walk up and smile and
    present that patient attitude. <br>
    <br>
    All this time my urge to wee was intensifying, and I knew that if I didn't go soon I would
    start wetting my panties. I started to retreat to the rear galley at every possible
    opportunity, so I could be closer to the loo at the rear of the aircraft. Time and time
    again as I got close to the loo a passenger would press that bloody button and request
    something. My bladder was at bursting point, and I knew that if I didn't g soon I would be
    having an accident in my uniform. As a rule, and this goes throughout the profession, all
    hostess's wear some sort of super absorbent panty liner for just this type of problem, if
    we didn't there would be trickles down most of our legs and this would be very visible. In
    my rush to make the flight from the hotel I had forgotten to add this vital piece of
    equipment to my lingerie and I was becoming increasingly worried, as the urge to wee was
    overwhelming. <br>
    <br>
    Just as I had finished serving the complementary drinks, the No. 1 (senior hostess)
    beckoned to me to start serving the first class with the aperitif. As I walked to the
    front of the aircraft I passed two sets of loos, god I needed to wee so badly. I
    eventually got to the forward galley, and by this time I had to press my hand into my
    crotch to prevent any leaks. <br>
    <br>
    This was certainly not the image of a professional airhostess. I collected a tray full of
    aperitifs from the storage cupboard and made my way to the first class. As I reached the
    second row I felt myself wee a little. I could feel the wee enter the double cotton lining
    of my panties. I squashed my legs together in an attempt to stem the flow, but all that
    did was squeeze the wee out of the cotton gusset and make it run a little down the top of
    my legs. During the attempt to stem the flow a fork fell from the tray I was caring and
    landed under the seat of the passenger opposite. I went cold and instinctively knew that
    if I bent over to pick up the fork I would not be able to control myself. As this thought
    passed my mind the No.1 walked passed. &quot;Well pick it girl,&quot; she said. Without
    hesitation I bent over forward and reached out for the fork and froze as I felt my over
    full and aching bladder start to relieve itself. Again I squeezed my legs together whilst
    still in the bent over position but this was a foolish mistake as all this did was direct
    the force my wee forward and over the waste band of my little tanga's, I was weeing hard
    and uncontrollably. I didn't dare move, the wee pored out not only from the crotch and leg
    seems of my panties but also over the waste band which in turn ran up my belly and between
    my breasts wetting my bra, finally poring out from the top of my uniform onto the floor. I
    was totally humiliated because all the passengers within the first three rows saw what
    happened. A big fat ugly man sitting to the right and front said with an American accent:
    &quot;Gee girl, I've seen a girl piss her panties before but I've not seen it come out the
    top of her dress, good shootun.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    I could have died, I stood up and as I did so a final gust of wee that had been hiding
    escaped, I placed my hand into my crotch desperately and by doing so made the wee come
    through my uniform and through my fingers making it visible to all that I was still
    weeing. The wee continued down my legs and into my shoes. I turned and walked back to the
    galley leaving a tell tale trail for all to see. At this point the No. 1 entered the
    forward galley and saw my distress. She came over with a look of disgust; she placed one
    of her arms around my shoulder firmly and the other on the hem of my very wet uniform
    lifting it up revealing my ultra wee stained blue tanga panties. I was shaking that much
    with fear not knowing what she was going to do or say that I started to wee my panties
    uncontrollably again right in front of her. At this moment she placed her hand between my
    legs pushing gently upwards towards the direction of the flow. &quot;There,&quot; she
    said. &quot;Place your hand here and it will stop, been there done that, get changed and
    get back to work girl&quot;. I was so amazed at her attitude I just stood there with my
    hands at my sides and my legs about two inches apart and finished my wee completely, even
    waiting for a moment for the last few drops to finish with the double cotton crotch of my
    little blue tanga panties.</font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><br>
