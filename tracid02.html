    <br>
    A few weeks ago, my class went to a factory for germs and such things in Vienna. We went
    there by bus, and the ride took about 3 hours. In the bus, I was sitting next to Anna, and
    with about 30 minutes left in the ride, I was beginning to catch first signs of growing
    desperation. First she was just sitting cross-legged, but soon she started to move them
    against each other and banging her knees. After a while, she started to look very
    distressed and I asked her if she was OK. She said: &quot;Yeah, I just have to go to the
    toilet real bad. I hope we get there soon.&quot; <o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This really got my attention. She
    continued to wiggle her legs around, and it seemed that her need was growing, as when we
    where nearly there, she started to press one hand into her crotch for a second. Finally we
    got there, and we all got off. It turned out that we were half an hour early, and that we
    were not allowed in until then. Anna sighed and said to me: &quot;I can't wait until then.
    I need a toilet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let's go then, I gotta go
    too,&quot; I said. It turned out that she was not alone, because five other girls and 2
    guys came along with us.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So on we went, searching for a loo.
    I took the time to survey the other girls. Two of them, Maria and Sandra, seemed to be in
    similar distress, because they were both taking really small steps and telling everyone to
    hurry up. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After another 10 minutes, in which
    Anna was growing really desperate, we finally approached a McDonald's restaurant and
    rushed in. When we passed the loos, I noticed a shield on the ladies, saying, &quot;out of
    order, please use the men's toilet&quot;. My heart jumped on that sight. I and the other 2
    guys left the girls to discover the bad (or good, for me) news on their own and continued
    into the men's' room. It was a small loo, with only two stalls and 4 urinals. When we got
    in, both of the stalls were occupied, and one girl was waiting to use them. One of my
    friends just had to pee, but the other announced that he &quot;had to take a bad dump,
    real bad&quot; and lined up for the stall, as did I, waiting for our girls to come in. And
    in they came, with Anna in the lead and the others close behind. Upon seeing us stand
    there, Anna made a face like she was going to pee her pants any minute and bent over
    slightly. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; I asked. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The ladies' are out of order,
    and I really have to pee.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Me too!&quot; shouted Sandra.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can wait&quot;, I announced.
    In the meantime, a small girl had cleared one stall and the other girl had walked in. When
    the other stall flushed, Anna asked my friend if she could go first, but he said he really
    had to crap and went in, only to let out a big fart right away. Anna was now standing
    cross-legged, slightly bent over, her little skirt just below her cute little butt. She
    was obviously really bursting, because she was stammering &quot;gotta got, gotta go&quot;
    all the time and knocked on the stall door continuously. Behind her in line was Sandra,
    who also had her legs tightly crossed. Maria in turn was doing a pee dance, shifting from
    side to side and running on the spot. The other three, Brigitte, Elisabeth and Eva were
    quite all right, although Eva began to shift her legs around too. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After 2 more minutes, the girl
    cleared the stall finally, and Anna hobbled in and closed the door, then immediately I
    heard pee gushing into the bowl. She was peeing forcefully, and apparently it made things
    worse for Sandra. She shouted to the guy in the other stall: &quot;Get out! I have to go
    now!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You'll have to wait,&quot;
    came the answer. Sandra moaned aloud and told Anna to hurry up, but she showed no signs of
    stopping. Maria was in trouble now, too. She had one hand firmly pressed into the front of
    her tight jeans and made hissing sounds. When Anna finally stopped peeing, she hobbled
    over to the stall and in front of Sandra. &quot;Hey, I am next,&quot; Sandra said. &quot;I
    gotta go first! I'm peeing my pants!&quot; said Maria. &quot;I don't care. I need to go so
    bad!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had not paid any attention to the
    other three girls, but suddenly Brigitte started to grab herself and said to Elisabeth
    &quot;I need to take a piss so bad, I can't hold it much longer.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I need to take a dump as well.
    I hope they are quick!&quot; With that they both went closer to the stalls, and shouted
    for my friend to hurry up in there.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When Anna finally opened the door,
    Sandra and Maria both tried to get into the stall, but Brigitte was quicker and closed the
    door before their faces. Sandra and Maria watched surprised, and just then Elisabeth ran
    into the other stall, which was cleared by the guy just then. That left the two girls to
    squirm outside, and when they heard the two in the stalls pissing, they sighed. Sandra
    seemed to reach her bursting point by now; she had both hands in her crotch and ran on the
    spot frantically. Maria also held herself with two hands and shifted her legs constantly,
    but suddenly she froze and said: &quot;Oh my God, I can't hold it any more! Hurry up,
    PLEASE!!!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's gonna take a while&quot;,
    replied Elisabeth from the stall. &quot;I can't wait!&quot; With that Maria hobbled over
    to a urinal, lifted her short skirt and pulled down her panties. She sighted with relief
    as she released a forceful stream into the urinal, and I almost came on the sight. That
    and the fact that Brigitte flushed the loo were too much for Sandra, she suddenly stopped
    moving and then begun to unzip her tight jeans frantically with one hand, while pressing
    the other on her peehole. When the door opened, she dropped her pants and I could see a
    little wet spot spreading quickly on her white panties. She made a dash for the stall and
    I saw her yank down here panties just as she reached the stall, trailing trickles of pee.
    When she reached the stall, she almost fell onto the bowl, releasing the strongest stream
    I had ever heard. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With all this action, I was as hard
    as a brick, and ready to cum on the spot. Eva was still waiting, and I asked her if she
    was OK. &quot;Yeah, I gotta pee, but not that bad,&quot; she said, pointing at Maria, who
    was just finishing off at the urinal. When Brigitte came out of the stall, she entered and
    peed, and so I waited alone to see a sobbing Sandra exiting her stall with no wet patch on
    her jeans. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I waited for Eva to come out, as the
    other stall was flooded with Sandra's piss, then sat down and jerked myself off with a few
    moves. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
