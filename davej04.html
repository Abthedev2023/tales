    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was 11:45 and Nancy had just
    finished her filing. That was a normal duty and what came later was her notion of simply
    completing the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She realized she had a
    full bladder and she was squirming somewhat in her tight gray gabardine skirt as she
    worked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not to worry as she would be finished
    in a few minutes and would be free to go to the bathroom on the way home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a fine Saturday morning in
    1957 that Nancy found herself working.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The building was open and therefore
    the office was open.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to impress
    her boss with her sense of duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of what
    she was doing could have been put off until Monday but there were two reports her boss had
    asked her to do that were outside the domain of her job description.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As she began to type the two- page report she
    found herself squirming a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She really
    needed to pee but she also really needed to have these reports ready for Monday morning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, the not so necessary was being
    overcome by the necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was now 12:15 and Nancy had
    finished typing the last page and she was very proud of her report.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gathered her things into her black leather
    handbag and prepared to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The office
    was vacant but if anyone had been there he would have been attracted to the picture Nancy
    presented when she stood by her desk to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    wore a gray gabardine suit with slim skirt and nipped jacket.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the jacket was a black blouse.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Underneath she wore all black: bra, slip, panties,
    and garter belt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Combined with her wavy black
    hair and dark eyes Nancy was a striking figure indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Perhaps, sexy would be the better adjective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>But, sexy was too forward a term in 1957.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She arranged her desk in two halves;
    one half for each summary and synopsis she had written on the two books her publisher boss
    had assigned her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was crossed-
    legged as she did this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>OK now for the
    bathroom and the bus home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she got to
    the bathroom she found the doors locked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What
    the hell is going on,&quot; she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
    she remembered that she had been told that building security locked all unoccupied rooms
    at 12:00 noon on Saturdays and left then locked until 0800 Monday morning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She crossed her legs momentarily and wondered,
    &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
    have to pee in the worst kind of way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She tried to think of a public
    restroom in the downtown area that would be open after noon on a Saturday and couldn't
    come up with a single one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She also knew that
    her bus would be coming to the stop within the next five minutes and that she had better
    be there as the next one would be an hour later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Needless
    to say Nancy felt trapped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She desperately
    needed to pee and had nowhere convenient to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
    as her desperation reached its height the bus pulled up.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She boarded feeling somewhat
    relieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At least, she would be on the move
    and toward her home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She should be able to
    hold it for the three-mile trip that would ensue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    found a seat near the back door and sat down, crossing her legs immediately.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She had to fidget a bit getting the sparse
    material of her skirt arranged to allow her to cross her legs tighter.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She desperately wanted to place her hand in her
    crotch but that was impossible without partially disrobing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once the bus was under way she
    counted the blocks it traversed and made mental calculations as to how much farther she
    had to hold her pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each block brought added
    pressure to her bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she noted that
    she was just four blocks from her getting off spot she began to relax.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I've got it made now as I'm sure I can make
    it the rest of the way.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot; Once I
    am walking I can hold it forever.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
    God.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But, at that point there was a
    detour sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The city had closed off her
    street for repairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bus turned 90 degrees
    away from the straightest course that would take her home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh dear God, can I make it now?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She was bouncing in her seat, squirming back and forth, and fighting tears
    as well as her swollen bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew her
    struggle was all over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a matter of seconds
    she would wet herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And, wet herself she did.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Half way through the detour she completely lost
    control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pee streamed out and was forced
    up into her lap by her crossed legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    noticed a spreading dark stain in her lap and quickly moved her hands off her lap.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt the growing puddle under her buttocks and
    thighs and she noted that pee caught between her crossed legs was spilling out onto the
    hem of the side of her skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She finally
    regained control after about 2 or 3 seconds of peeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>But, the damage was catastrophic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her face burned as she came to
    realize the sight she would present when she stood up to disembark.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was overwhelmed with a feeling that she was
    the loneliest person in the world. She was totally alone in her wetness.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No other adult would do this, how can I live this
    down?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've got to walk a block past my
    neighbors after I get off the bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everybody
    will see what I have done and will laugh at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
    am I going to do? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It was time for her to
    signal her desire to depart the bus.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She half stood and pulled the signal
    cord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her wet slip was sticking to the back
    of her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had a large dark patch in
    the front of her skirt and a small patch at the hem of the side of her skirt.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The back of her skirt was one huge dark patch as
    it was drenched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Where her skirt folded in
    front as she sat a small dark patch was forming as pee was traversing upward from the
    crotch of her panties by capillary action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
    wish I could die,&quot; she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She disembarked the bus by the rear
    door absolutely sure that the few passengers in the back saw her plight.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew they would be watching her in the future
    and that she wouldn't be able to look them in the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She hoped none of her neighbors were out and about.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to hide somewhere and bawl her eyes out
    but she knew she wouldn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She held her head
    erect and walked the half block to her house as proudly as she could.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A boy and a girl in their pre-teens skated by
    Nancy as she soggily strode home and Nancy overheard the boy ask the girl after they had
    passed &quot;Reckon that lady will get grounded when she gets home?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She thought that this couldn't be
    happening, I can't believe I have done this; it just has to be some sort of horrible
    dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt like the loneliest person in
    the world out there on the street in obviously peed clothes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her options for concealing her accident were so
    few that she wouldn't even consider them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    just had to buck up and take it and that is what made her situation so horrible.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Dear God, thought she, could this be real?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please let me be having a horrible nightmare.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just can't believe this happened, she thought as
    she walked along with wet garments slapping the back of her legs and wetness in her crotch
    spreading in front of her skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tears were
    streaming down her cheeks and she wanted desperately to get control of herself.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It just has to be a bad dream.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If I close my eyes maybe I'll wake up and close
    her eyes she did.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy immediately awoke alone in her
    bed in her apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her bed and pajamas
    were soaking wet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She slowly came to realize
    that she had been indeed dreaming as she wet her bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She lay there awhile trying to collect her thoughts and finally remembered
    that it was probably the wee hours of Sunday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A glance at the alarm clock confirmed that it was 5:00 AM.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had been out drinking the night before...had
    consumed a lot of beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, was it a dream?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, it had to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>But, it was so real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was so
    real that it was scary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she realized
    that she was wet, smelly, and cold.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She got out of bed and sloshed her
    way into the shower and turned it on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she
    stood under the all-cleansing stream of warm water she completely voided her bladder and
    shucked off her pajamas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These she rinsed and
    wrung out and pitched out onto the tile floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
    she placed the stopper in the drain and squirted bubble bath into the tub of rising water.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon she was languishing in a warm tub full of
    bubbles and she settled into its embracing hug and masturbated.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Completely relaxed she began
    contemplating the events of the past hour or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was
    her dream of wetting herself in public in broad daylight a portent?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was so real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>What should she do to avoid that ever happening, after all there were
    circumstances where such a thing could happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    dream explicitly showed how a few innocent decisions could lead to disaster.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While she mulled these questions the warm water
    and bubbles took over and she drifted off to sleep without resolving a single question.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
