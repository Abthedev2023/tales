    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On their second date Bruce and Nancy
    were ensconced in a neighborhood tavern where they were drinking beer and scarfing up on
    all the goodies that were served at the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
    had gobbled up six or seven beers by early afternoon and a couple of bowls of chips and
    popcorn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After the first six beers they had
    both relieved themselves and were quite aware of further requirements for relieving
    themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Before the next requirement came to
    their attention, Bruce suggested that they retire to his garden apartment to grill some
    steaks on the balcony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy thought it was a
    great idea and stood up to prepare to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
    Bruce and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy had a slightly full bladder
    but both thought that they were in control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    each stood each realized that they were suffering from a very full, rather than a slightly
    full, bladder and neither wanted to admit to such a fact at this point. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After all, Nancy wanted to appear
    cool and collected and Bruce had the same desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
    had said that his apartment was only twenty minutes away and Nancy had decided that she
    could wait another twenty minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
    Bruce was in his own territory it was easy for him to make a decision regarding his
    somewhat desperate need to relieve himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So
    the two of them left the neighborhood taproom in a somewhat discomforting situation.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, they had to pee and pee badly but they
    plunged on and decided not to let the other know of their distress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce knew of the rule of six beers
    as he had drunk many times with many friends while in the service.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that after the first visit to the restroom
    that all subsequent visits were demanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    one had consumed six or more beers and had at last gone to relieve himself that all
    subsequent calls for relieving his bladder were to be answered immediately.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce knew that his drive to his
    apartment would be cutting his need to pee very closely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He was sure that he could make it but he knew that any obstacle in the way
    would probably result in a disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
    decided not to go to the restroom before leaving the bar simply because he was sure he
    could make it home and he wanted to appear cool. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was a bit younger than Bruce
    and she didn't know of the six plus beer rule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    had been to the bathroom several minutes before Bruce suggested that they depart for his
    apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They spent a few minutes
    discussing the menu and just how they would grill the steaks and how they would prepare
    the accompanying dishes and the spices before they decided to depart. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once they were in Bruce's car the
    need for relief became obvious. Nancy began to squirm in her seat and to pull and tug on
    the pants of her light blue jumpsuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    was at a disadvantage, as she had no idea of how far it was to Bruce's apartment.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was beginning to wonder if she would make it
    there when a traffic light caught them and caused them to stop. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce had gone through this many
    times and he knew that sitting still at a traffic light was the worse thing that could
    happen to someone with a full bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    glanced over to Nancy and saw that she was extremely tense and that her legs were crossed
    as tightly as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that Nancy
    was in as bad a shape as he but his desperation kept him from enjoying Nancy's situation.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, he really wanted to enjoy it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was on the verge of wetting
    herself but she decided to keep it to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    all, how long would it be before they arrived at Bruce's apartment?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It couldn't be too far, she thought as she
    clinched her thighs together and hung on for dear life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bruce looked over at Nancy and knew she was in misery and cursed
    himself for being in the same condition, making it difficult to enjoy Nancy's situation.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bruce had always enjoyed watching a woman
    desperately trying to avoid wetting herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But,
    on this occasion he was too close to embarrassing himself to be that much interested in
    what Nancy was going through. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the next traffic light turned
    red before Bruce could get through it, he thought that he would severely embarrass
    himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He really needed to pee and being in
    a stationary position was no help at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    he squirmed in his seat he noted that Nancy was doing the same. Jeez thought he, I have a
    date about to wet herself, a situation I have dreamed of for many years and I can't enjoy
    it, because I am about to wet my own pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    simply must hold out, as I can't let this woman know that I am anything less than cool.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Meanwhile, Nancy was thinking
    &quot;Dear God, why can't he get a go on a traffic light. If I have to sit still much
    longer I will surely wet myself. Oh God, please let me hold it until we get there. I don't
    want to tell him of my desperation because that would be so uncool. I like this guy and I
    don't want to humiliate myself before him.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    struggled on with her full bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce was shifting around in his
    seat but not so much as to be noticeable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He was thinking that he had been
    down this road before but not with someone as neat as Nancy. He knew how far he had to go
    and he knew just how long he had to hold his water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    was confident that he wouldn't humiliate himself before this very neat girl.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the pressure was intensifying.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, out the corner of his eye he thought he saw
    Nancy slide her hand into her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew
    that this girl was absolutely desperate but he was also absolutely desperate and he didn't
    dare slip his hand into his crotch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy thought, &quot;I must ask him
    to find a place for me to use a restroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    that would be so gauche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were in his
    neighborhood when we left the bar and his condo couldn't be too far.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I simply can't ask him to stop somewhere so soon.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would look so unsophisticated.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It isn't that bad, as right now I'm in a relief
    mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oops here it comes again!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce was thinking that he couldn't
    cross his legs as he was driving. Crossing ones legs and holding ones member is an
    excellent way to avoid having a wetting accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
    crossing his legs was out of the question, holding himself was even more out of the
    question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He simply couldn't let Nancy know
    how badly he needed to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That would be so
    uncool. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So there they were, both needing
    desperately to pee and neither admitting their desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Bruce was now pulling into a parking spot in the front of his apartment
    building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He got out of the car and ran
    around the front to open the door on Nancy's side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    was sort of shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he opened Nancy's door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy was afraid to get out and stand up, as she
    was sure this would cause her to lose all control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    she did swing her legs out, stand up without mishap and with great relief followed Bruce
    into the building and up the stairs to his apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>They were both too desperate to use the slow moving elevator and their
    desperation apparently became known to each other even though no word of it was spoken.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy noticed an unusual amount of
    tension on Bruce's part when he was trying to get his key into his apartment door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She then began to suspect that Bruce had to pee as
    badly as she.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a scenario would be
    delightful if her dilemma wasn't so severe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
    finally got the key into the lock and opened the door to his apartment.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce, sensing Nancy's desperation,
    said,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;We are here and the bathroom is
    down the hall on the right if you want to use it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>While Nancy wanted to keep her desperation a secret she decided that she
    would take him up on his offer for her to have first chance at the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She moved into the bathroom without any qualms
    whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Bruce went into the
    kitchen to get the steaks out of the freezer and to gather up the herbs and spices for the
    feast- anything to keep moving.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy, in the bathroom quickly
    pulled down the zipper of her light blue jumpsuit but the need to pee was now
    overwhelming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She slid her hand into her
    crotch and pushed up on her peehole with all her might.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Holding herself with one hand she wondered how in hell she could get her
    jumpsuit down so that she could pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    wriggled her shoulders as hard as she could but the jumpsuit stayed in place.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy moaned; &quot;Goddamn it, I'm going to wet
    myself- Oh no I can't hold it!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce, in the meantime had left the
    chores he was doing in the kitchen and walked over to the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was on tiptoes and bent over at the hips.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He managed to yell out for Nancy to please get out
    of the bathroom, as he had to get in there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce's
    situation was so desperate that he no longer cared to maintain what he thought was cool.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">By this time Nancy had started to
    wet her jumpsuit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A dark stain was
    proceeding down her crossed leg and she couldn't stop it so she sat down on the commode
    with her clothes on and peed through them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    a while the normal sound of a female peeing into a commode was heard and Nancy became very
    ashamed as well as relieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she stood up she rued the dark
    patch in the front of her pants and she felt the rear and noted that she was very wet in
    the seat of her pants. &quot;Dear God what have I done,&quot; thought she. &quot;I've peed
    myself like a little child. I can't hide it, what am I going to do- I don't want Bruce to
    know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What am I going to do?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh God I can't believe I did this.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She noted some paper towels hanging on a roll and
    she proceeded to try to dry herself with the highly absorbent paper towels.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About this time, Bruce, who was
    beyond desperation shouted, &quot;Please let me in as I can't wait any longer.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce hated this admission of his desperation but
    it had to be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Telling a lady friend that
    he desperately needed to pee was infinitely better than peeing in his pants.
    Unfortunately, there was no longer a choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
    this point Bruce was hunkered over from the hips with legs crossed and with his right hand
    holding his member in the desperate need for relief into any facility.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When Nancy heard his latest plea she
    was gratified to know that she had guessed correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Bruce did indeed need to pee as badly as she. Well, perhaps not quite so
    badly, since she HAD wet herself. She was still wiping her jumpsuit pant legs with paper
    towels when she heard Bruce's plea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    looked down at her pant legs and decided that any drying was hopeless.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With tears streaming down her cheeks she opened
    the bathroom door to let Bruce in. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What she saw was a shock.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was Bruce standing upright with his hands
    crossed in front of his crotch as if to conceal something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>His pants were wet from halfway between his waist and crotch all the way
    down to his ankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce had simply lost it
    and completely peed himself in front of his bathroom door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A large puddle was present on the parquet floor where he stood.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A mask of strain tinted with a bit of relief shone
    on his face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy stopped crying immediately.
    She knew that what Bruce had done was far more humiliating than what she had done.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't try to analyze that thought- she just
    went with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was OK on occasion for a
    woman to have a wetting accident but it was never Ok for a man to do so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce was angry and he was ready to
    vent it; &quot;Goddamn it, look what you made me...&quot; and his venting trailed off as
    he noted Nancy's wet pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;How could
    you pee yourself when you are already in the bathroom?&quot; he asked.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She replied, &quot;You should try getting out of a
    jumpsuit with one hand.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce said,
    &quot;One hand?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She replied, &quot;I
    was holding myself with the other one for Chrissakes.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>They stood in silence looking at one another for another moment or so. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally Bruce said, &quot;I guess we
    pushed the pee envelope beyond its limits.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>She replied, &quot;So what are you going to do about it?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He noticed a sly grin on her face.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess I need to
    get you dry and cleaned up so you are presentable for the rest of the evening.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And just who is going to do the same for
    you?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her grin was now a broad smile.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You big pants wetting sissy.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Do you know of anyone who will change a
    grown up?&quot; asked he.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes and I
    know someone who will not only change a wet bottom but who will spank it as well.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Let's get to it,&quot; he said.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And they advanced on to each other pushing their
    wet pants together while massaging each other's wet crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Somewhere it was heard, &quot;This could be the start of a beautiful
    friendship.&quot;</span></p>
