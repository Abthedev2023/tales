    </p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As we round
    the corner I spot her right away, there leaning against the lamppost with her gleaming
    legs tightly crossed, central to my vision like she had deliberately stood where I was
    going to look. 'How about her?' I say to Howie, and with a grin he pulls over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl
    smiles and walks across to the car, and I'm struck by this look she has- all bright and
    shiny, like the sunlight's just streaming straight through her. She's maybe twenty,
    twenty-one, not too tall, not too blonde, and with enough showing below the line of her
    little yellow top to tell me she must exercise her belly every day to keep it that shape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Are you going
    anywhere near Brinwell?' she asks, and I give Howie a look that tells him we are, but
    we're not going to get there any time soon. He chuckles, and I'm sparing a thought for all
    those unfortunate guys who don't have a friend like Howie. He's one of those men that
    easily make a lot of friends, because nobody wants to be his enemy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Would you
    like a lift?' he says with that smile of his, the one he uses on his audiences. You can't
    resist that smile. 'We're heading right past where you want to be, we can drop you off.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This plan of
    his is working brilliantly already. I look away from the girl as she goes round to the
    back seat, not wanting her to see that I'm beaming right across my face. She gets in so
    quickly and quietly that I hardly even hear the car door close; I'm concentrating so hard
    on keeping myself from laughing out loud. The poor girl, she doesn't know what's coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was living
    with him when we were students down this way, and to my young self, having someone like
    Howie close by was an invaluable resource. He got into hypnotism when he was only
    thirteen, after reading a book about it from the school library, one of those books they
    never expect anyone to find and have probably forgotten all about anyhow. By the time I
    met him, he was getting very good at it, and now that his show has taken off I guess he
    must be up to professional standard, much as he moans about the pay. I'm looking forward
    to seeing what he can do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He turns
    around and smiles at the girl. She smiles back, but I see their eyes lock, I've seen it a
    hundred times. That's it, all done, now she's ours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Howie rolls
    the car forwards, and it doesn't take long for the landscape to change. Funny how, down
    here, you can be at a beach one second and plunged right into the middle of the
    countryside the next. Everything changes just like that when you're in a car, flashing
    from one scene to another, especially the way Howie drives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'So,' I say,
    not wanting to let the silence last, 'what's your name?' I hope she doesn't notice I'm
    looking at her legs and the way that they're crossed, higher than the knee, and very
    tightly. What's she trying to hide? Do I look like someone who would stare, given the
    chance?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I force my eyes upward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Hayley,' she says, but doesn't
    smile. The corners of her mouth move up - she turns that frown upside-down - but it's not
    a smile, it's a polite signal. I guess she hasn't had time to feel comfortable with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She ain't seen nothing yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She's very nice on the eyes, which
    is great news. I manage to run my eyes up her legs while she's looking out the window and
    I feel my eyebrows jump up because they just don't end, like thinking you're at the top of
    the stairs but there's one step left, I stumble over how high up her legs go before they
    cross and vanish into that little khaki skirt. But she's not very tall, funny that. In
    fact she's not very big at all, it's a wonder a girl her size could carry a rucksack as
    vast as the one that's grinding down into the seat to her right. What's it packed with? I
    can only see the top of one of those family-size drinks bottles poking out from where it
    hasn't done up properly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Stop staring, Terry; you'll pull a
    muscle or something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Have you hurt yourself?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I start at her words, before I
    remember the cast on my foot. 'I broke my ankle. It was my own fault. I had a momentary
    lapse of shame and tried to walk along a high wall. I'm just glad nobody was there to see
    it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She smiles. I guess I broke the ice.
    'I'm here on holiday. I'm just hiking around the county, trying to see where I can get.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'So you'll want a place to stay the
    night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Howie laughs. 'You work fast,
    Terry.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'I mean room and board. In
    Brinwell.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Brinwell, huh? What have you got
    going up there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I can't believe him sometimes.
    'Howard, she just said, she's hiking around.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Sorry,' he says with a grin, 'I
    wasn't listening.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I think it's about time we began.
    I'm already looking at those legs again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Go on,' I whisper. He clears his
    throat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Since you're already on your way to
    Brinwell,' he calls back, 'I guess I wouldn't mind if you decided to sleep.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As soon as he's said it, all the
    life drains from her eyes. It's eerie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Don't keep her in long,' I say, but
    he just smiles and waves it off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'You are becoming aware that your
    bladder is full,' he says, in a voice that sounds too casual. I half doubt it'll work at
    all. 'You become, with every passing second, increasingly desperate. However, you will not
    be able to see any way that you could relieve yourself, every public toilet we pass, you
    will see it as a drinks stand.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I laugh. Ingenious twist, Howie. He
    always knew how to do irony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Okay,' he says, and she's released.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her legs squeeze together. I can't
    believe it's as simple as that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I give him a look asking him
    &quot;How do you do that?&quot; He gives me one back that means, &quot;Like I'd tell
    you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He's not heading for Brinwell, I
    know that much. We would probably be there by now if he had been. Instead he's driving
    around, letting me watch, to make sure he has done it properly. I asked him this morning
    if he was a hack, if these hypnotism shows were all just tricks done with audience plants,
    but I'm starting to come round to the idea that when he said he'd prove it, he really
    wasn't lying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl's face has fallen even
    further, she's still lovely but in a pouting kind of way, those big eyes of hers are
    gazing out of the window with longing at all the bushes that line the roads out here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Are you okay?' I ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Yeah,' she says in reply, and she
    doesn't mind that I was here when my friend was talking to her about her bladder. I asked
    Howie about it once, he said they can remember being talked to, but they don't think of it
    as a special event, their brain remembers it like it would remember a fly going past, and
    if they happen to think back to the hypnotism it just washes over, like a blind spot. They
    remember what the hypnotist told them, but they just don't care, and they definitely don't
    suspect it has anything to do with what's happening to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's happening to Hayley is she's
    looking for a toilet and not finding one. I see a hand slide down across the top of her
    hip, then falter and go back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'We were wondering about stopping
    for drinks on the way,' I invent, just to see her reaction. 'Would that be okay?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She looks at me with a bothered
    frown, and then she looks briefly, very briefly, at her watch. Her eyes barely have time
    to focus before she replies, 'We could, but I'd like to get to Brinwell quickly.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I smile and turn back. 'It's
    working,' I whisper to Howie, and he is still grinning to himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The drive goes on like this. Twenty
    minutes pass before I hear her gasp, and I look in the wing mirror and see that she has
    her eyes screwed shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I turn to get a better look. Her
    legs are tucked under her now, one hand is gripping tightly around the handle of her
    rucksack and the other is on the armrest in the side of the door, fingers tapping at the
    hot plastic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Are you all right?' I ask her,
    feeling sympathetic now even though I know it's all just an illusion of the mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She thinks a moment, then says, 'I'd
    like to find a toilet.' She says it calmly, but her eyes are big and round, and locked
    onto mine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'I haven't seen one in a while, but
    we'll keep looking, won't we Howie?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He nods. She smiles, waiting for me
    to turn around, and when I do, I see in the wing mirror that she bites her lip hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Five minutes pass, then ten, and by
    fifteen she has her legs down in front of her again, and I can see that the ankles are
    twisting, the feet rubbing hard against one another. Her eyes stay closed now, and I think
    to myself how amazing it is that she hasn't worked it out yet. After all, she can remember
    being hypnotized, way back in the quiet parts of her brain. She could clearly see the
    public toilets we have driven past, three of them by now, passing through smaller towns
    and villagges. It's not as if her brain superimposes a picture of a drinks stand over the
    toilet blocks, Howie told me earlier, she does see them as they are. It's just that the
    message gets sent to a funny part of her brain and she thinks, until Howie brings her out
    of it, that a public toilet is a place where you go and buy a drink, and has no
    accommodation for someone who just needs to urinate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And she does. Those feet are really
    grinding together. Her fist keeps clasping and unclasping, not around the rucksack handle
    now but around her other arm. She plays with her hair, keeps changing position slightly,
    but it seems to be doing no good. The expression on her face is one of real desperation. I
    start to feel bad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Howie, should we keep this up?
    Don't you think we ought to let her go?' <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I'm whispering just loud enough so
    he can hear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'She doesn't need to go,' Howie says
    in his normal voice. I guess he knows something about hypnotism that I don't, that she
    can't hear when we talk about what's been done to her. 'It's just a suggestion of the
    mind. Her mind's feeding her the feelings, but there's nothing real about it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'I hope not,' I say, a little
    irritated, as if it were I in her predicament, 'because ----- won't be pleased if she
    spoils the seat.' I left out my sister's name there; she's the one who lent me the car.
    I'd promised to drive Howie to and from his gigs, but after I broke the ankle he's had to
    do the driving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I think I hear a little sound from
    the back of the car, a little moan, but <o:p></o:p>I can't be sure if it was just the engine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We rattle along for another twenty
    minutes. I see Hayley start to move about in the back seat. At first it's just shifting
    her weight, but after ten minutes or so the changing positions become more exaggerated.
    She'll be sitting looking out of the window, then her eyes will close, her legs will swing
    up underneath her and her whole body will shift to face the other way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally I see a look wash over her
    face that makes my heart thump, and not because I'm enjoying it. It's panic. Close to
    pain, a sort of total desperation that I haven't seen before. I shoot a look at Howie, but
    he isn't paying attention to her or to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'I really should get out,' she says
    quietly, 'I think I need to find a toilet soon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I look over to Howie, who doesn't
    respond at all. Why is he acting like this? All he was going to do was show me his
    hypnotism worked, not draw it out like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'We'll find you one,' I say
    decisively, and this time he does see my glare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Here the roads are high up, at the
    top of some remote hill. Goodness knows how far he has taken us. We can see, spreading out
    on either side, a few fairly good sized towns, no doubt teeming with toilets, and I bet
    that's what she's thinking too, because she is looking back out of the window again, and
    her eyes are wet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The car begins to climb up a steep
    rise in the hill. The car gets heavy and slows down as it tries to climb. 'Come on,
    Howie,' I say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl's head bows. She looks up
    again - I can definitely see a small tear working out of one of her eyes - then closes her
    eyes, grits her teeth and ducks her head again. She doesn't think she can hold on. But
    it's all in her mind. Isn't it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One hand disappears between her
    legs, which she crosses hard over it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Every time I think we're at the top
    of the hill it goes on some more. The girl can't hold on any more, it's obvious. I wish I
    could just explain to her that it's all in her mind, help her snap out of it. I wish Howie
    would bring her out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly the car races over the top
    of the hill. Howie must have been giving it all he had because as soon as the car hits a
    downward slope it lurches into top speed. The girl's rucksack tips, and the huge
    family-size drink bottle slides out and onto the seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's empty. Totally. There are
    droplets on the sides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl lets out another moan, and
    adds a second hand to the efforts of the first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Howie,' I snap, 'it's real. It's
    not in her mind; it's real! She drank a family-sized bottle before we picked her up! All
    you've gone and done is help it along! Howie, you idiot, she's...' I lower my voice.
    'She's going to do it in here, Howie, on the seat. She can't hold on, and my sister's car
    is going to be ruined. Now for goodness sake, let her out will you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'It's not real,' he says, but he
    turns off the road onto another, which seems to lead down to one of the towns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'We'll find you a toilet,' I say to
    Hayley, and all she can do is nod a little. Her face is screwed up tight and I see the
    muscles in her arms tense as she squeezes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The car takes ten minutes to drive
    all the way down the road and towards the town. There's a gulped cry from the back seat. I
    try not to look around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There's a toilet up ahead; I can see
    it. Howie puts his foot down, and just as he's about to zoom up the road, between the
    picturesque houses and town buildings towards the block in the center, a tractor pulls out
    of a side road right in front of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Howie swears under his breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Oh, now you seem to care,' I say
    angrily. 'Thanks for that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He pauses for a moment. 'Terry, I
    can't have anyone having an accident in this car. What if she were to sue? The evidence
    would have seeped so far into the seats there would be no denying it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I can't believe he just said that,
    so I don't reply. Instead I just sit forcefully back into the seat, arms folded, face red.
    Behind me I can see <o:p></o:p>Hayley practically writhing, and meanwhile, the car is not moving at
    all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Hayley, do you want to try getting
    out and walking?' I ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'I -' she pauses for breath. 'I
    can't! Can't stand up!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Both her feet, I notice, are drawn
    up to her now, on the seat. With her little skirt lifted by her legs I can see where her
    fingers are pressing on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's damp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'We'll get you there,' I say, and
    glower at Howie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The tractor takes an age to lead us
    up the road. Hayley has stopped changing positions now and remains, feet on the seat,
    forehead resting on her knees, and both hands pressing furiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Howie,' I warn. He just snorts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girl looks left and right, and
    then lets out a cry. The tractor is still there. The toilet is just up ahead. Then she
    gasps, and there's a flash of wetness, which sprinkles out in front of her. I blink and
    wonder if I really saw that. A tear is running down her other cheek. Her fingers are
    pressing on harder. Her knees are knocking together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I look back at Howie. He smiles. The
    tractor pulls out and goes down a side road. The toilet is just next to us now. He'll slow
    the car down now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'It's all right Hayley,' I say, and
    then I lurch back into the back of the chair as Howie slams down the pedal and the car
    roars forwards, past the toilet block and up the road. What can I do but stare at him as
    he lets the car speed ahead?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What else can I
    do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'No,' she groans, turning her head
    against the back of the seat and banging her knees together harder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Howie!' I splutter, finally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'It's not real,' he grins, driving
    on. But it is, I know it is. I can see the empty bottle. He isn't listening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'No,' she cries out, and her knees
    stop knocking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly there's a stream that
    bursts free. Her fingers dig in and it stops, splattering down onto the floor of the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her head rolls; her teeth bite down
    on her bottom lip. 'No!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A second stream sails across into
    the back of my chair. I can see the seat under her is wet. I can see it streak out through
    the material and between her fingers.<o:p></o:p> She cries out, and more sprays forward with force,
    spattering the back of the seat and her legs, running down onto the seat and flowing in
    pools off onto the floor. She writhes in agony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There's a terrible, lingering pause,
    a few precious seconds of nothingness, when the poor girl's face twists even more, so vast
    is the effort she has to exert to keep all of that rushing, raging liquid inside her. She
    must be thinking about shame, about how much like a nightmare this is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All she says when her lips crack
    apart is, &quot;This isn't real,&quot; before the flow begins again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I turn to Howie. 'This isn't funny
    any more. She'll sue. It's not funny.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He roars with laughter and carries
    on up the road. Why would he find this so amusing? Hasn't he messed with this girl's mind
    enough for today?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then, as a long spray comes all the
    way forward between the two front seats and sprinkles down over the handbrake, I begin to
    think about something. I look behind me at the crying, writhing girl on the back seat, and
    the damp seat underneath her, and I wonder about what sort of person Howie is. What sort
    of joke might make him laugh?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">His mind games are very clever,
    after all. He has proven that much to me today. But how clever? No. Surely not, would he
    even think of it? The floor of the car isn't wet. I can see puddles there, but the car
    isn't wet. Not when I look carefully. Still the sunlight from the windows outside is
    streaming right through the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She gives a wail and further streams
    begin running in rings around her bare legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'This isn't real,' she moans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>Glaring at the laughing hypnotist in the driver's seat, I realize that she is indeed
    correct.</p>
