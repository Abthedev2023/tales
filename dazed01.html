    </span></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Kathy, I need you to take
    these plans to the crew working on county road 9, and you can take the company car.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kathy had been with doing the
    administrative work for the counties' crews and was well acquainted with the remoteness of
    some of the areas they worked in.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She drank her third cup of coffee
    and then headed out the door for her destination.&nbsp; The day was nice and sunny and she
    turned on the radio fully intending to enjoy the brief freedom from the office.&nbsp; The
    trip would take about 45 minutes one way and she was in no hurry to return.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she turned off the main highway
    and headed up the beginning of the remote county road she was becoming aware of an urgent
    need to pee.&nbsp; &quot;Damn, why didn't I go before I left the office,&quot; she sighed.
    &nbsp; Oh well, there would probably be a rest area on the way someplace so she tuned back
    into the music.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she turned on a narrow corner of
    the road, a flashing sign greeted her stating &quot;road closed ahead.&quot;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;God no&quot; she gasped, at that time she was greeted by a young female
    highway worker who identified herself as Jill.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm sorry ma'am, but there has
    been a rock slide ahead and the road is entirely<o:p></o:p> blocked, we don't get a lot of traffic on
    this road so I'm afraid you will either need to turn back or wait it out while they clear
    the road.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kathy asked the young blond worker
    if she had any idea how long the delay would be, explaining she had to deliver some very
    important forms to the engineers up on Tallow ridge.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well they have been going at
    it since dawn so it could be another hour or so before it's passable.&quot;&nbsp; Kathy
    knew she could not turn back because there was no other route to her destination.
    &nbsp; She instead used the cell phone to call the office, almost hoping he would tell her
    just to forget it and they would take them later.&nbsp; She was told to wait it out as the
    forms had to be there before evening.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The situation was now serious and
    the building need to relieve herself was becoming desperate.&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried in
    desperation to conceal her problem but it must have been more than obvious, as Jill
    approached her car she asked, &quot;Are you ok, you look very stressed about
    something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm ok, just a little too much
    coffee this morning is all,&quot; she stated.&nbsp; &quot;If you don't mind me asking,
    where do you go to the bathroom when you have a need.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jill laughingly replied,
    &quot;There's a nasty ole Johnny on the spot around the bend but I would have to be
    desperate to use it, if I have to go I just go by the side of the road when it's quiet
    like this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kathy was now out of the car and
    pacing back and forth in desperation and knew she had to do something soon or it would be
    too late.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well I have some very
    important papers in the car and I don't want to leave them and besides it's a company car
    and the boss would die if it was hit or something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Look honey,&quot; Jill said,
    &quot;I know you have to go bad, I can tell by the way you're acting, and besides there is
    no one here but us, just pee here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her words struck like thunder, there
    was no way she could pee in front of a total stranger but it was a long walk even to the
    woods.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I-- I can't do that&quot; Kathy said, realizing inside she had no
    choice, and angry that she let herself get in this shape.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure you can, just squat here
    in front of your car and if someone else comes I'll stop them far enough back that they
    won't see you...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With red faced submission, Kathy
    stepped in front of the car and slowly began<o:p></o:p> letting down her slacks, all the while
    looking back and forth to see if anyone was coming. &quot; Don't worry about it,&quot;
    Jill said, &quot;I've seen a woman pee before it's no big deal...&quot;&nbsp; She was even
    more embarrassed as Jill just stood there in front of her &quot;don't you think it might
    be a good idea to pull the panties down too, or are you planning on peeing through
    them.&quot;&nbsp; Again Jill's words only made her all the more embarrassed, here she was
    pulling down her pants and panties and would soon be peeing in front of a total stranger.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Reluctantly and with trembling
    fingers she pulled the elastic bands of her panties away from her flesh and slid them down
    towards her knees and squatted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Will you please not
    watch&quot; Kathy said, &quot;I'm very embarrassed by this and I need<o:p></o:p> some privacy.&quot;
    &nbsp; &quot;Oh honey quit worrying and pee will you&quot; Jill replied trying to<o:p></o:p> calm
    Kathy down.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In just a moment it seemed the dam
    broke, all modesty was now out the window,<o:p></o:p> streams of yellow piss ran down a trail towards
    Jill.&nbsp; Kathy was even more humiliated as Jill slowly made her way towards her being
    careful not to step in her pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What was she doing, Kathy wanted to
    run desperately, but she could not stop the torrent of pee coming out of her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kathy watched horrified as Jill
    approached her and began slowly unzipping her pants. &quot;God no what are you
    doing,&quot; Kathy cried out.&nbsp; Jill did not answer but crept closer all the while
    undoing her pants and as she now approached directly in front of the peeing woman she slid
    her pants and panties down and squatted directly in front of Kathy.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You reminded me I have to go
    too, and there's no need to make two streams now<o:p></o:p> is there,&quot; and with that Jill began
    letting her own stream go directly in front of the shocked Kathy.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kathy could not believe it, but she
    was transfixed on the peeing pussy in front of her, embarrassed that she did not turn
    away.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Almost as quickly as it began the
    two floods now subsided, Jill rose in front of Kathy and again Kathy was embarrassed as
    she stared at the girls full brown bush wet with the recent flood of pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Just then the sound of a distant car
    approaching broke their gazes and the two hurriedly pulled up their panties and pants and
    each retreated to their own vehicles.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Two hours later Kathy was on her way
    home but she would never forget the wild and erotic adventure of that afternoon in early
    September.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
