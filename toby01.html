    <br>
    <br>
    The most daring I have ever been was in July of this year. It was a Sunday afternoon,
    chilly but crisp and clear. I was sitting on the balcony of my apartment, drinking beer
    with my new flat mate, Anna. We were chatting away comfortably when she mentioned the time
    she had wet herself after a university pub-crawl. I was instantly aroused, and tipsy
    enough to press her for more details. Anna was very obliging, in no way guessing that she
    had inadvertently stepped right into the territory of my secret passion. Then she turned
    it round, and asked me when I last had an accident. I couldn't tiptoe round the issue, for
    the beer had made me alarmingly honest. I felt myself go bright red, and Anna, realizing
    straight away that I was in hot water, started carrying on to receive an answer. So I told
    her the truth that only two weeks ago I pissed my pants after jogging round the royal
    gardens. I didn't tell her that I pissed them on purpose! Instead I said that I was
    totally desperate, and went to squat near some bushes, but as I was about to pull my pants
    down some schoolgirls walked past, so I just &quot;went through my pants.&quot; Which was
    what basically happened anyway, except that I had planned the whole thing.<br>
    <br>
    What happened next is hard to account for, if only because I was so aroused at the time
    that my recollection is both vivid and hazy at once. Anna had just finished her beer and
    said something like, &quot;all this talk about pissing is making me need the toilet,&quot;
    words to that effect anyway.<br>
    <br>
    I recall exactly what I said back- &quot;It would be funny if you wet your pants.&quot;
    Then there was a strange silence, or it felt strange to me anyway. But she didn't move,
    and I didn't say anything. We just sat, two flat mates in the sun- full, a little tipsy,
    and for me at least, outrageously horny. My love for wetting myself tends to feed itself,
    like it gets empowered in the right conditions. If the seed is planted in my mind, and I
    feel horny, then sooner or later my knickers will be soaking. I remember trying to
    visualize a chance to do it later that night, and then wondering what would happen if I
    just confessed to Anna and peed on the spot. As soon as that thought entered my mind, I
    became a little intoxicated with the idea of pissing myself right there on the balcony. I
    felt my bladder stir alongside a massive heart flutter, and with my mind a little muddy
    after three beers; there weren't too many parts of me left in opposition to the idea. It
    all happened really quickly. I remember staring down at the sunlight reflecting off my
    ankles, then at the black cotton material of my leggings, and then I felt the familiar
    tingle of release in my groin. The trickle worked its way through my knickers, and
    suddenly we could both hear the distinct splash of my piss jetting through my black tights
    and onto the terracotta tiles. Anna's eyes were wide open with amazement as I peed without
    restraint.<br>
    <br>
    She didn't say anything for the duration of my piss, and nor did I. We just sat there in
    the afternoon sun, watching the river of my urine flow without hindrance, and listening to
    the dulcet tone of it hitting the tiles and gather into a large puddle beneath me. When
    finally it abated, I felt a strange mixture of complete embarrassment, rich fulfillment
    and intense arousal. Anna was pretty cool, she said something a little offhand, to diffuse
    the situation, and I just jumped up and ran to the shower. In the privacy of the bathroom,
    the embarrassment dissipated, leaving an uncontrollable lust to get at myself. I often get
    horny, and often relieve such feelings, but rarely do I throb in pure aching desire. This
    time I was throbbing. I remember holding my pussy through my wet pants, rubbing
    frantically, and just not being able to satisfy myself. So I lie down in the bathtub, put
    my hand in my pants, and frigged myself almost violently. I was so hot that my orgasm was
    more like a natural extension of the present, rather than some place I had to reach. It
    took ages to calm down; even after the shower I remember fingering myself whilst drying.
    The whole experience was groundbreaking, if only because I have never before or since been
    that brazen.<br>
