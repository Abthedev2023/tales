    <br>
    <br>
    Sighting?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well no, but sort of a story.<o:p></o:p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Back in the
    late fifties and early sixties I was an enlisted member of the United States Air Force.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1962 I was in a position as a peon who
    manned the coffee bar at my squadron operations facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>In this role I was privy to many pilots' conversations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was one conversation that was
    particularly interesting, as you will see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
    squadron was one of fighter interceptor aircraft in the New York/Washington D. C. air
    defense sectors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These fighter interceptors
    were two-seater, two engine aircraft capable of mach one speeds with a cruising range of
    1500 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, for the purposes of this
    story they normally cruised at less than mach one for less than 1500 miles.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">These fighter/interceptors
    occasionally provided what was called morale flights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Morale flights were flights designed to transport military personnel to a
    base as close to their homes as possible when there was an emergency within the family of
    the said military person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Red Cross
    coordinated the flights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most of the
    time these morale flights would be on transports that were regularly operating, but
    occasionally they would require a flight on a fighter/interceptor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Having established all that the
    conversation between two pilots at the coffee bar went something like this.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pilot two; &quot;Where did you fly this weekend?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The usual training flight?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot one, &quot;No I had a Red
    Cross flight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I used one of the F-101's to
    take a female airman to Davis-Monthan AFB.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot two; &quot;How was the
    flight?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot one answered,<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;OK for me but I think my passenger would
    rather that it didn't exist.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot two, &quot;Why so?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, it was a female airman
    and her father was dying and she was the only one in the family capable of disposing of
    his remains and settling his estate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Early
    Saturday she was issued a flight suit, helmet, parachute, and briefed on the use of all
    these items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was even given a small
    satchel to hold her personal effects on her lap during the trip.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We met on the tarmac and I noted that she was a
    quite pretty lady and I assured that I would get her as close to home as fast as I could.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I also noted that she fidgeted quite a bit while
    we were talking but I passed it off as nervousness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    all she was about to fly in a mach one jet fighter, who wouldn't be nervous?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I leveled out at 30,000 I put
    on my best airline captain's voice and explained to her that we would be flying at 30,000
    at about 500 mph until we set down at Davis Monthan, AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The flight would take a bit under two hours and to sit back and
    relax.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 2:<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;So why was the flight less than
    routine?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 1:<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;About an hour into the flight I looked
    into the rear view mirror and noted that she had her oxygen mask off and that she was
    bawling like a baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I ordered her to get her
    mask back on immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She did so
    but I also noticed a severe strain on her face when she lifted her head to put the mask
    back on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I appreciated the fact that her
    briefing was so good that I didn't have to walk her through getting her mask back
    on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 2: &quot;What do you think
    happened?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 1: &quot;Apparently all the
    hustle and bustle of the mornings briefings kept her from using a bathroom when she
    desperately needed to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The flight,
    though short by a pilot's standards, was too long for her and she peed herself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 2: &quot;Yeah, how do you
    know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 1:<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;After we parked at Davis Monthan she
    was able to disembark the aircraft before me and I noticed dark wet stains on the back
    side of her flight suit below the parachute pack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also
    as I disembarked I glanced into the back seat and noted a puddle in the floor of the
    cockpit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sort of felt sorry for the
    parachute packer and the aircraft crew chief for having to clean up after her but those
    guys have had to contend with far worse humiliations.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She could have but didn't vomit all over the consoles like some of the male
    passengers have done.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pilot 2:<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's a shame that the pee tube and
    flight suits just aren't conducive to females relieving themselves in flight.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>This story took place in the early sixties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two
    decades later females are piloting those jet fighters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I wonder if the zippers go deeper on the flight suits and if the pee tubes
    have wider mouths.</p>
