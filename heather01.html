    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was no doubt in the collective
    minds of any of Kristi's family.&nbsp; The tall blonde eighteen year old could pee. Not
    pee in the conventional average normal definition of the word.&nbsp; No, her urinations
    could easily take on superhuman characteristics in the early morning hours of dawn. The
    incessant endless splattering of her urine acted as an alarm clock for her two sisters and
    her mother still in their beds. Her characteristic interval pee-pause, pee and pause would
    drone on and on, until at last the very unrelenting unceasing nature of it would finally
    rouse the other three who would file into the bathroom shaking their heads.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As Kristi blossomed into young
    womanhood, puberty seemed to of had the serendipitous effect of stretching and enlarging
    her already enormous bladder by several orders of magnitude. To those intimately close,
    everyone had a favorite Kristi &quot;pee&quot; story; the time she shocked the lavatory
    attendant and the time she out-peed a succession of flabbergasted women. True, she laughed
    it off and went along with the jokes her family dished out, but inside her rather unique
    ability began to prey and worry her. Worry her for a strange new set of reasons she could
    barely articulate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tomorrow, she started as a senior
    transfer student in a brand new high school with a thousand new faces. Irrational, wild,
    pee-shy thoughts raced through her mind. Hypothetical situations. What if she really had
    to take a pee and had to use the girl's restroom. How would the other girls react to her
    peeing and peeing, liter on top of liter? What would they say? Going for minutes on end,
    when would she have enough time?&nbsp; In the darkness of her bedroom, Kristi tried to
    dismiss the fears and qualms as silly and stupid. Since when did a person's peeing ability
    ever become a psychosexual focal point? Drifting off to sleep, she briefly thought about a
    male counterpart, and pondered the question of teenage boys' peeing ability. Was there
    some guy anatomically endowed like&nbsp; herself?&nbsp; She smiled at the fantasy of a
    handsome, well-endowed jock type standing at a urinal with a long penis hanging out, just
    peeing forever and ever while dozens of guys at adjacent stalls came and went. The fantasy
    sent an odd shiver of excitement coursing through her body.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Week one passed without incident.
    &nbsp; She simply waited until after school to pee, her giant bladder easily holding a
    daylong supply of urine until she reached home.&nbsp; The same thing happened with week
    two.&nbsp; Perhaps she could conceivably pass the entire school year without using the
    facilities.&nbsp; Nobody would ever know the strange little secret of Kristi Anderson's
    body.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I need two volunteers for an
    after school project. How about you Kristi, our new classmate? Want to help Eric out with
    printing these school newsletters for us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kristi looked over to the guy
    sitting two rows over.&nbsp; She had noticed him since her first day of class. Every girl
    had since he was a star athlete and since his normal attire was a pair of jeans that did
    little to hide his considerable appendage. As he took his seat in the class, every female
    would take a fleeting glance at the snake-like bulge down the inside of the blue denim.
    Probably a jock-with-attitude, Kristi thought. Still? &quot;O.K. Miss Smith. I'll help out
    if you need me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the bell sounded at three
    o'clock, the students filed out of Larchmont High and quickly dispersed into the nearby
    neighborhood, leaving the campus with an eerie scholastic ghost town feel. Kristi's steps
    echoed in the empty hallway as she made her way into the small office in the rear of the
    building where the school newspaper was printed. She still hadn't had the opportunity or
    the courage to use the facilities, and her bladder was starting to feel the accumulation
    from her very healthy kidneys. All that bottled water she drank didn't help matters.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hi Kristi,&quot; chirped Miss
    Smith. &quot; You and Eric have all this to do on your own. Sorry, but I have an
    administration meeting to go to. Just lock up when you are finished.&quot;&nbsp; And with
    that the instructor left the two with the dubious and less than rewarding job of last
    minute compilation.&nbsp; Material so drab and innocuous it could only be fit for a
    student newspaper.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">An hour passed. Boring except for
    the fact the two started to get along. Kristi's striking tall blonde looks were not lost
    on the usually indifferent Eric, and his charisma captivated her. &quot;Hey, &quot; said
    the disgusted athlete. &quot;Do you want to go with this Norbert Wins Science Project or
    with Holly and her cello?&quot;&nbsp; Without waiting for a reply, he shook his head.
    &quot;Man, do I have to take a pee. Sorry.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The sudden change of subject on to
    one so personally sensitive for Kristi brought on an involuntary minor gasp, nearly
    inaudible, which she hoped he didn't notice. The suggestion caused her bladder to throb
    along in protest.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;So do I, but we have to get
    this job done,&quot; she insisted. The two worked in silence for a few more minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Geez, I can't concentrate.
    It's really strange 'cause I never have to go. I'm one of those that can just hold it
    forever, then...&quot; his sentence trailed off.&nbsp; Kristi nudged him and smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes. Go on. You were
    saying?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Then, you know. Then when I do
    pee...&quot; he shook his head, &quot;I set records.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She could scarcely believe what she
    was hearing.&nbsp; A strange mixture of excitement and need came over her, and yet,
    because she was a woman, an odd sense of control took over.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Look, I have to pee as badly
    as you and I'm not complaining.&nbsp; We're almost done, and the nearest restrooms are
    clear across campus.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't know if I can last.
    I'll try.&quot;&nbsp; He was clearly desperate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kristi suddenly spied a large empty
    metal trashcan next to an adjacent file cabinet. With a giggle and a toss of her hair she
    motioned to the container. &quot;Eric, if you really have to go, why don't you use that?
    Then, biting her lower lip she added, &quot;or do you need something larger?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Are you kidding? I will. But
    if I do it then you will too.&quot;&nbsp; A newly found bravery overwhelmed her. Tempered
    with caution. &quot;Lock the door.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Alright. Deal. But if someone
    passes by the room, we have to make it look like business as normal. Why don't you take
    the trashcan behind the desk with you? Men can pee while they sit, can't they?&quot; She
    let out a second giggle. She could not believe she was capable of this impish behavior.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sitting behind a large executive
    type desk, he lowered his jeans and took an awkward legs apart posture at the edge of the
    chair, while a few yards away Kristi sorted papers and worked the printer as the school
    news rag popped out. She forced a casual atmosphere while deliberately keeping her back to
    him. Moments passed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then more.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hmm, I don't hear anything. Is
    everything working O.K.?&quot;&nbsp; Taunting; feminine and teasing in nature.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That was just the sympathetic
    impetus needed to initiate his flow. Within the small confines of the room the air became
    filled with a cacophony of metallic hiss like rain on a gutter. His urine gushed out
    steadily into the container between his loins, a flow that continued and continued. At the
    table, Kristi fought the urge to glance up at the clock on the wall with the sweep second
    hand.&nbsp; He peed on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;These newspaper printouts
    don't look too bad. Want to read one while you pee?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Held captive by his bladder, he
    again needlessly apologized as she turned around and handed him a paper.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sorry, but I told you when I
    pee I really pee.&quot; He cut off the flow.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't be silly. Besides, you
    haven't been going for that long. Call it a good start on a good pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her attitude, reaction and comment
    both surprised and excited him for reasons unknown. His chums had always known him as
    Eric- the horse pisser with the horse cock. As he resumed his stream, the metallic
    drumming was slowly replaced with a splashing sound as the container started to fill. This
    while simultaneously on the opposite end of the room Kristi's mind secretly went over all
    the men she had ever heard pee. Her father was a little squirt. Uncle Bob could take a
    pretty good pee, but no. At a rest stop once she had heard a man on the other side of the
    wall almost keep up with herself- but that was several years ago and she really didn't
    have to go.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">No, this handsome stud was clearly
    in first place among male pissers. She turned away and closed her eyes as she tried to
    visualize the unmentionable; what did it look like? Long, very long. Pale with a large
    flanged pink head and perhaps some bluish veins running along its great length. With a
    stream pouring out, of course. She felt her legs grow weak and her bladder throb. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One could not overstate the
    contradiction of emotion in that room, as one peed and the other one walked about seeming
    to ignore and shrug off the impressive urinary performance of the other.&nbsp; Two minutes
    later his stream tapered off to a finale.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Whew. At last! That sure felt
    good. God, how long did I pee?&quot; He inquired half wanting to know.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The Final Chapter-Kristi's Triumph<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh Lord. You men are so
    egotistical and vain. I mean it was a good pee but I wouldn't call it any record breaker.
    Of course I don't know you well and I take back what I just said if that was just a
    routine pee for you. Now if you'll please be a gentleman it's my turn, and be patient
    because I believe this may take a while.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The two exchanged places, and as
    Kristi sat down behind the desk she let out an involuntary gasp as she viewed the level of
    pee inside the waste container. Despite the forced nonchalance on her part, it was clear
    he had a more than impressive bladder having filled the can over a quarter full. His
    output would have to have been several liters at the least. But now it was her turn.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She slipped the dark Nike warm up
    pants and white panties down to her socks, exposing her quite shaggy golden blonde curls
    and puffy labia with red- pink bubble gum-like minora hanging way out partially hidden by
    all the hair.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She paused a second to separate the
    lips, a deft parting of her butterfly wings. What followed was a spray-stream interval of
    twenty seconds, a quick pause, followed by another repetition, and another, a pee style in
    stark contrast to that of her predecessor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You are so right. This feels
    so good!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Eric, in a state of total confusion,
    stood at rigid attention looking out the opaque office window. The sound of her pee just
    filled the room and he fought to keep his penis flaccid.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Would you please try to relax?
    You didn't see me acting weird when you peed. Why don't you finish stapling those pages
    together? You can place two of the piles on this desk and two of them on the counter by
    the printer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her work assignment temporarily
    distracted him. The usually confident jock held his head low and furiously staple gunned
    papers together, while so close but out of visual range, Kristi peed...and peed the
    contents of her enormous female bladder, adding to the level of the trashcan. Though it
    was felt by both, the heretofore unmentioned fact was the she was peeing away with an
    ease, an unwavering persistence that was an anatomic marvel to behold. Above his head the
    sweep second hand of the wall clock went around and around. Dare he say something lest he
    be labeled a perverted male? Only, he thought, if the opportunity presented itself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hand me another staple gun.
    &nbsp; I guess I can finish these two piles while I'm peeing. Girls have to do something
    to while away the time while we pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Eric was almost unfamiliar with the
    urination habits of the female &quot;species&quot; but he often wondered why they spent so
    long in the restroom. Was it in fact because they were peeing all that time? Again he felt
    a surge in his loins when he saw the tall stack of attachments and made some subconscious
    mental calculations.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;O.K. here you go, but there
    are a lot of papers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kristi flashed a thousand watt smile
    and almost cooed, &quot;Well, as I said before. This may take awhile.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly out of his control, an
    erection grew along his left inseam he was helpless to conceal. This hottie was driving
    him crazy; crazy with her incredible peeing. And yet, through it all he tried to maintain
    some guise of social dating decorum his good upbringing had taught him. Thus the sounds of
    staples intermingled with the splashing sounds of pee in a pail, punctuated only by the
    brief, three to five second pauses as Kristi's muscles ran through their little unique
    cycle. Her peeing style always deluded people into believing she was finished, and only
    added to the additional shock of her listeners when her stream would burst forth for the
    umpteenth time in full strength and glory.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;May I please, please say
    something and not be called a sleazoid? I know I can't look, but every time you stop
    peeing I think you're done, except you're not. There's always more. And...well...er... how
    do I say it and not be called a pervert?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Just then Kristi stopped her flow
    with a full ten second pause, followed subsequently by a powerful steady resumption.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You mean like that? That's
    just the way I pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;So how much can you pee?&quot;
    He said it like a babbling immature youngster making a new revelation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She gave still another knowing
    kilowatt smile followed up with a demur laugh. All pee-shyness had left her. She was now a
    young woman in complete control.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, my dear Eric. That is
    something in which you will have to find out. Come here and watch if you'd like&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Not to protract the events of that
    afternoon any more than they already were, but that was the day Eric discovered that all
    female bladders were definitely not created equal. Without shame he openly stared at her
    well-developed womanhood, the dense gold matting of fur and the large reddish lips and
    clitoral hood protruding outward. Above all, he was captivated by the pee; which surged at
    times like a unified stream, other times like a spray. Nobody could pee like her, not
    himself and five of his best buddies on beer. An eternity later the last drops fell into
    the trashcan, and together the two viewed the summation of their bladders efforts. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;About two-thirds full,
    wouldn't you say? I guess that's enough peeing...for now,&quot; Kristi replied drying
    herself off with a tissue and deftly storing her hair and large labia into the small
    confines of the white panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That year, all the female students
    agreed. Never had they seen a prized jock like Eric fall for a girl so fast. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
