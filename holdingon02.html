    <br>
    It has been a long weekend and I am now a bit bored. Memories from last Sunday's monster
    hold make me feel warm and that makes me want to ride the piss wave of beautiful agony
    again. I was going to give my bladder a break but an opportunity came up so, I decide to
    try another hold. Not as long as last week, I know that I will never hold out at home like
    I did in the car. Having a toilet nearby is too much temptation for me. I am going to
    really push the fluid though - 20 ounces every half hour, 8 ounces more each half hour
    than last week's hold. Maybe it will fill me fuller, faster. Here are my notes.<br>
    <br>
    1 pm - I open a diet coke, a friend comes by to take me shopping. She goes to the bathroom
    and complains about her tiny bladder. She says that she spends half her life in the
    bathroom and the other half with her legs crossed. I know this to be true as I have
    traveled with her and seen her doubled over for a pee when everyone else is just at the
    &quot;if there's a toilet nearby, I would like to stop stage.&quot; She is always
    embarrassed about asking us to stop so she usually waits until she is quivering. Even so,
    I have noticed that she barely pees for 10 seconds when she says that she is bursting.
    Today I said, &quot;Have you tried stretching your bladder?&quot; She said,
    &quot;How?&quot; So I told her to grab a diet coke and I would show her. We drank our diet
    cokes and went shopping.<br>
    <br>
    2 pm - I get us each 16 oz. diet cokes at the mall. She says that if she drinks it, then
    she will be peeing her pants. I explain to her that if she thinks that she will, she will.
    I told her just to drink the drink normally and not think of anything else.<br>
    <br>
    2:30 pm - My friend has finally finished her drink (I drank mine in 5 minutes). She says
    that she really needs to pee. I assure her that she will be fine but that she must train
    her bladder a bit by holding instead of going to the bathroom all the time. I promised
    that I would not make her wet her pants and we kept shopping. We finished up in about 15
    minutes and she said that she really wanted to go before we left the mall. It's only 20
    minutes to my house so I told her to hold on. She was getting a little fidgety but I felt
    completely empty so I knew she couldn't have too much in her.<br>
    <br>
    3 pm - She is fine on the ride home- I keep her distracted by talking about other things.
    When we get to my house she is fine until I take some time finding the key and opening the
    door. She is crossing her legs now and wants to pee badly. I open the door and tell her to
    go ahead. While she is in the bathroom I open another Diet Coke and chug it because my
    hold is just beginning. She came out of the bathroom and said, &quot;I haven't peed that
    much in ages!&quot;<br>
    &quot;See?&quot; I said &quot;you can hold more if you try.&quot; I told her to wait 30
    minutes from the point of needing to go before she goes to the toilet for the next week
    and see how it &quot;goes.&quot; I will let you know what she tells me!<br>
    <br>
    3:30pm - I have now had 40 ounces of diet coke and have chugged 40 oz. of water. I am
    cleaning the house and start to feel that familiar feeling of the base of my bladder
    filling and all the little nerves waking up as they are stretched. I don't have to go
    badly, at least not for me. On a scale of zero to 10, I am at a 3. There is definitely
    urine in my bladder and if I move from sitting to standing, I feel a slosh against my
    sphincter. Time for another 20 ounces of water and more housework.<br>
    <br>
    4:30 - I have had another 20 oz. of water. Total fluid consumed is now 100 ounces or about
    3 liters. It is raining outside and the washing machine is filling up. There is water
    everywhere and my body is now letting me know that it has made it's own. The nerves all
    over my bladder are now responding, telling me that the urine has turned it from a bag to
    a balloon with pressure on all sides. As I unloaded the dryer I felt a sharp pang. I need
    to be careful bending over, as unexpected pressure could result in disaster. I do my
    Kegels regularly so my sphincter is strong, but it does have its limits and I don't want a
    big spurt gushing out before I can stop it. I can honestly say that I never leak but I
    don't want to start now. I want full control of the hot puddle inside me.<br>
    On a scale of 0-10 I am now at a 6. It is hard to concentrate on my tasks and listening to
    the rain splatter off the eaves is making it worse. I really want to pee, but I will wait
    until I need to pee and finally, I have to pee.<br>
    <br>
    5:30 pm - another 20 ounces of water. I drank this more slowly as my whole body is full
    and it is harder and harder to drink more. It has stopped raining but my bladder feels
    like all that rain ran into it. I am up to a 7 on the desperation scale. I am sitting with
    my legs crossed and my muscles clenched. The pressure is unrelenting; all sides of my
    bladder are stretching. I am going to try to paint my nails to distract myself from the
    wave of piss that keeps slapping my sphincter. I need to pee. I am afraid to fill up my
    cup as the sound of the water from the cooler may be too much for me to bear.<br>
    <br>
    5:45 pm - 10 more ounces. The nail painting was a mistake. I am at an 8 on the desperation
    scale and I need some relief. Why won't these *&amp;^% nails dry. I need to press my hand
    against my hole- anything to relieve the surges and spasms that are starting. I may try to
    lie down and see if that helps. I need to piss so bad that my thighs ache. All the
    pressure is making me horny and wet but I keep panicking that the wetness is my bladder
    leaking. I must keep from pissing my panties. I know that I am not really full but damn I
    need to go. My stomach is a solid bulge. I am afraid to touch it, the elastic from my
    panties against it are torturing me.<br>
    <br>
    6:00 pm - 10 more ounces. Damn, I messed up the nail polish on one hand but I just could
    not help myself. It was press it shut or let it out. The spasms are every couple of
    minutes. Lying down was no help. My bladder is so full; there is piss everywhere in it. I
    am sitting on my heel. I am going to have to pee soon. I need to go refill my glass but I
    am afraid to walk that far.<br>
    <br>
    6:15pm - No more ounces. Filling the water glass was torture. The sound of water splashing
    into the bottom of the cup made my piss strained bladder quiver. I bent over my crossed
    legs and squeezed as hard as I could. Nothing escaped but it was as close as I have been
    in a long time to pissing all over the floor.<br>
    <br>
    6:25 pm - I am at a 9 on the desperation scale. I am afraid that I am going to pee my
    panties but I want to hold as long as possible. I need to get the measuring jug but I
    don't think that I can walk. I am bouncing in my chair, squeezing and sliding back and
    forth. I keep changing positions from sitting on my heel to sitting with my thighs
    clenched. I cannot be still now. I am really debating just giving up and wetting myself
    but I am too well trained. My bladder is aching. I keep drinking water but I have to let
    some out.<br>
    <br>
    6:35 pm - went to get the jug- ooh barely made it back. Major spasm- can't type. Must pee
    soon.<br>
    <br>
    6:37 pm - I am doing permanent damage. I have to piss. I cannot be still. The phone rang
    and the sound made a gush slide down my urethra. I stopped before it splashed out but it
    is still there torturing me. Did not answer the phone. Oooow man, I am going to wet my
    pants. There is no way I can squat over that jug without spraying piss everywhere.<br>
    <br>
    6:43 pm - I tried to let a little drop out for relief but my sphincter won't let just a
    little out. I am too well trained. It is all or nothing. It is about to be all. I can't
    keep holding on. I need to let this river free.<br>
    <br>
    6:41 pm - I think I just pissed for 4 minutes. There is piss down my leg and on the floor
    and 1425 ml in the jug. I have never pissed that hard, the spray was so strong and it
    started as soon as my panties were off- before I was fully squatted over the jug. I am
    ashamed of myself for my poor control. Grownups do not pee on themselves or the floor but
    I couldn't help it. The stream was so hard it made foam. The relief was orgasmic, the way
    those hot spurts felt jetting out of my throbbing hole will keep me happy for a while.<br>
    <br>
    Any guys like to hold like this???<br>
