    <br>
    It was still dark when Jenny woke a few hours later with a vague sense that something was
    wrong- very wrong. But she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was that was wrong. It
    was a sensation - a feeling - that was at once familiar and unfamiliar, but which she was
    sure she oughtn't to be feeling. Not here. Not now. But what was it?<br>
    <br>
    She took a moment to consider her surroundings. What was the anomaly? She was in bed. Not
    her bed; a double bed. That was as it should be: she remembered Sam offering to let her
    stay for the night and showing her up to the large, inviting double bed.<br>
    <br>
    There was a body asleep beside her in the bed. Jenny peeped under the bedclothes and saw
    the outline of two well proportioned breasts standing firm and proud. It was a female
    body, then. That was also as it should be: she remembered Sam climbing into bed with her
    and, flushing ever so slightly at the memory, she also recalled what had happened next.
    And how good it had felt. And as she recalled the incident, she felt a light fluttering of
    butterflies in her tummy, and smiled ever so slightly to herself.<br>
    <br>
    So far so good. But something still felt wrong. What was it? She tried to narrow it down
    by a process of elimination. Was it something inside the bed, or outside? Hmmm -
    definitely inside. Something to do with her, or not to do with her? That was easy. It was
    definitely something to do with her. So what was it? The nightdress? She never wore a
    nightdress at home, but she remembered mummy dressing Baby Jenny in her pink teddy bear
    nightdress, so that was as it should be. Could it be her knickers, then? She didn't wear
    knickers in bed at home, either. But again she could remember mummy giving Baby Jenny the
    nice soft floral print knickers to change into after she'd had her second accident; so
    they were as they should be, too.<br>
    <br>
    But it was certainly something to do with her nightdress and knickers. She felt sure of
    that. So, ever so carefully, she placed her hands on her nightdress where it covered her
    breasts and (after giving her nipples a quick tweak and enjoying the sensations and the
    memories that it stirred) she ran her hands slowly down the nightdress, feeling all the
    way, trying to work out what was not right about it. The hem of the nightdress had ridden
    up a bit while she was asleep, and her fingers encountered it half way up her tummy. She
    continued her exploration, past the hem, over the bare expanse of her tummy and past the
    waistband of her flannelette knickers. The front of her knickers felt ever so slightly
    warm. And wet. And the further down between her legs she felt, the wetter it felt. She
    raised her hips a little and slipped a hand down under her bottom. The back of her
    knickers was absolutely sodden; as was the sheet beneath her.<br>
    <br>
    She sat up in horror. She had wet the bed! Despite everything: despite promising Sam that
    she wouldn't wet the bed; despite realising half way through their love-making that she
    had a full bladder and ought to go for a wee before she went back to sleep (it now dawned
    on her that she hadn't actually done so, however: SILLY girl!); despite all of this, she
    had gone and capped the total abject humiliation of wetting her knickers twice the day
    before by wetting Sam's bed in the night as well.<br>
    <br>
    She was mortified. How could she have done this?<br>
    <br>
    Well, she realised when she came to think it through, it was actually pretty clear how she
    had come to do it. A big bowl of ice cream before bed; a jumbo-sized mug of cocoa; and
    then letting herself drift off to sleep when she already knew her bladder was getting
    full. And not just her ordinary light sleep, but a lavender, cocoa and orgasm-induced
    sleep, which was all but guaranteed to be a deep, deep slumber- the sort of slumber from
    which even a screaming-fit-to-burst bladder would have difficulty rousing her. There was
    scarcely anything more she could have done to ensure that she ended up wetting the bed as
    well as her knickers, even if she'd tried.<br>
    <br>
    Next to her, Sam was becoming dozily aware that Jenny was sitting up in bed. &quot;What is
    it?&quot; she asked. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny tried to answer her friend, but found she couldn't as tears of frustration, shame,
    and humiliation began to roll down her burning cheeks. She couldn't bring herself to
    confess to Sam that, in spite of her promise, she actually had wet the bed as well. She
    just couldn't. Or rather, grown-up Jenny couldn't. But what, she wondered, about Baby
    Jenny?<br>
    <br>
    She sniffed back a tear, and tried once again to answer her friend.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sowwy, mummy,&quot; she said. &quot;Is mummy cross with Jenny?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No darling,&quot; Sam cooed back. &quot;Of course mummy isn't cross with
    Jenny.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny didn't mean to do it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What didn't you mean to do, sweetheart?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny's wearing wet knickers, mummy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh Jenny,&quot; soothed Sam. &quot;Have you wet the bed?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, mummy&quot; sniffed Jenny, dissolving into tears once more. &quot;Jenny's wet
    the bed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But you promised mummy you wouldn't wet the bed, didn't you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes mummy,&quot; said Jenny, feeling utterly miserable.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You should have let me give you a nappy to wear, shouldn't you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes mummy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You'll let me give you a nappy next time, won't you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, mummy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good,&quot; said Sam, brightly. &quot;I'm glad that's agreed. There will be a next
    time, and you'll wear a nappy too.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Did I just agree to that?&quot; gasped Jenny in wide-eyed surprise. &quot;Oh God, I
    suppose I did, didn't I?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You did indeed,&quot; confirmed Sam. &quot;Now, to practical matters. I only have
    two pairs of Baby Sam training pants and one Baby Sam nightie; and you seem to have
    managed to wet all of them now. I'm afraid I've nothing else dry that will fit you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not to worry,&quot; said Jenny, her mind now preoccupied with the practicalities of
    the situation she had got them into with her uncharacteristic lack of bladder control.
    &quot;I don't normally wear anything to bed. We can strip and change the bed, and throw
    the wet things I'm wearing in the laundry, and I'll be quite happy spending the rest of
    the night naked.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We'll do no such thing!&quot; protested Sam. &quot;And you, my dear sweet darling
    Jenny, are going to keep those wet pants on!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why?&quot; asked Jenny, feeling more than a little bemused.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because,&quot; replied Sam, &quot;I want to show you how much better your orgasm
    will be if you're wearing wet pants.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And she did.<br>
    <br>
    When they were done, Jenny felt physically drained, completely all-in. She had never in
    her life felt so completely, totally and utterly exhausted; and she just lay back in her
    wet knickers, in the middle of the puddle she'd made in Sam's bed (the mattress, she
    wearily noticed, was obviously protected by a plastic sheet, and her pee had puddled
    rather than soaking in the way it did the one time that she'd wet the bed as a child), and
    fell fast asleep as she was. She slept the deep, contented sleep of a girl who has just
    had the most spectacular orgasm of her entire life, and she slumbered peacefully until her
    alarm clock rudely pulled her into the world of the awake once again.<br>
    <br>
    She sat up in bed and looked around. For the second time that night, she had a keen
    sensation that something wasn't as it ought to be. She was in a single bed. Her bed. Not
    Sam's bed. And Sam wasn't in bed beside her. She was alone. She wasn't wearing Baby
    Jenny's nightdress and knickers, either. She was naked under the covers, as she always was
    at home. And she definitely was at home. Not at Sam's house. The room was her room, not
    Sam's room. The clock, which had just woken her, was her alarm clock, not Sam's alarm
    clock.<br>
    <br>
    Slowly, realisation began to force its way through the muddled confusion inside her brain.
    She must have been dreaming. That's what it was. Everything that she could remember
    happening &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;last night&quot; had been a dream. None of it
    had really happened. She hadn't been to visit Sam. Sam hadn't confessed to playing
    &quot;certain games&quot; in bed with Marcus. She hadn't gone swimming wearing a pair of
    plastic knickers to keep her own jade green cotton knickers dry. She hadn't wet her
    knickers twice, or even once. There had been no sex romps with Sam. And she hadn't wet the
    bed. She found this hard to accept. It had all seemed so real. So vivid- so...believable.<br>
    <br>
    Yet none of it had really happened. None of it, that is, except ... oh gosh! OH NO! With a
    growing sense of horror, she realised that her bottom and thighs felt warm and wet. She
    slid a hand down under the covers and felt her under sheet. It was wet! Absolutely soaked!
    She couldn't believe it: she actually HAD wet the bed! That whole weird, incredible dream
    had obviously been her sleeping brain's way of rationalising the feeling of her bladder
    giving up the struggle to hold on and of her peeing in her sleep. Her cheeks burned with
    shame. She hadn't wet the bed since she was seven years old! How could it have happened to
    her now? Her unprotected mattress would be ruined, of course. She'd have to see about a
    replacement.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny heaved a great, sorrowful sigh and climbed out of bed. She stripped the bed and put
    her wet sheets into the laundry basket for future attention. Not wanting to smell of pee
    all day, she took a quick shower before dressing herself. Her underwear drawer was almost
    empty. Correction: it WAS empty, except for her jade green cotton knickers and bra. She
    put them on, and made a mental note to put a load of underwear through the washing machine
    as soon as she got home from work, before attending to her sodden bed linen. She peeped
    out through the curtains. The sky was clear, and it looked as though it would turn into a
    scorching hot August Friday; so she dragged her light cotton knee-length dress over her
    head, grabbed a quick breakfast, then picked up her shoulder bag and headed off to work.
    She reviewed her diary during the long, slow bus ride into the town centre. Five home
    visits, ending up with old Mrs Finch at 3 o'clock. Finish slightly early, and visit Sam to
    admire her new swimming pool. It was rather too long since she had last seen Sam, so
    they'd have a lot of catching up to do. If she could bear to admit to her embarrassing
    bed-wetting accident, she might even tell Sam about the peculiar dream she'd had last
    night.<br>
    <br>
    A few hours later Jenny said &quot;goodbye&quot; to her last client of the day, and
    hitched her shoulder bag up onto her shoulder as old Mrs Finch closed the front door
    behind her. The sun beat down on her, and a heat haze rose from the pavement. A gentle
    breeze took the edge off the heat, but it was still by far the hottest day of the year so
    far. She felt thirsty, and longed to take a long, refreshing swig from the bottle of water
    at the bottom of her bag; but she dared not. She was already feeling the first faint urges
    of the need for a pee, and there was nowhere that she could stop to use the toilet on the
    long walk across town to Sam's house. Sure she'd be able to use the toilet when she got to
    Sam's; but she didn't want to arrive so desperate that she had to rush to the toilet as
    soon as Sam opened the door to let her in. After all, Sam had invited her to come and see
    their new swimming pool, and it was only polite to go and admire it first.<br>
    <br>
    The walk to Sam's house took her through the town centre, where some teenage boys hanging
    around on the street corner cheered when a little gust of wind took her by surprise and
    lifted the hem of her light cotton dress to show them her knickers. Blushing furiously,
    she beat down the dress with her hands and hurried on. Apart from that the walk passed
    without incident and, fifteen minutes later, she was knocking on Sam's door and squeezing
    her thighs together to ease the slight discomfort she was now feeling in her bladder. But
    it was nothing to worry about, she assured herself. It wouldn't take long to admire the
    swimming pool, and then she could excuse herself and go for a much-needed pee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny! Over here!&quot; Sam's familiar voice greeted her from the far end of the
    house. She turned to see her old friend in an elegant turquoise one-piece swimsuit.
    &quot;Perfect timing. I've just laid afternoon tea on the back patio. Come on round and we
    can sit and have a good chin-wag. Catch up on old times. It must be what ... two years
    since we've seen one another?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Two and a half,&quot; Jenny corrected.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh yes, that's right. It was Christmas, wasn't it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    So Jenny followed Sam round the side of the house and onto the back patio, beyond which
    the water of the new swimming pool glinted and glistened in the afternoon sun. There was a
    table on the patio, with a parasol giving it shade, and the table was set with a bone
    china tea service and a plate of scones thick-spread with cream and jam. Sam ushered Jenny
    to a seat and poured two cups of tea. At the sound of the tea gurgling and tinkling its
    way down the spout of the teapot and splashing into the cups, Jenny felt an unwelcome
    twinge in her bladder. But she didn't think it would be polite to make a dash for the loo
    just yet; so she crossed her legs tightly and said nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny drained the last of the tea from her cup, and Sam offered to refill it for her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No thanks, Sam,&quot; Jenny smiled, recalling what a disaster that second cup of tea
    had led up to in her dream the night before. &quot;My bladder's nearly bursting as it is.
    I'll need to use your loo before I head off home, and I've a hundred and one things to do
    this evening. So let's just have a quick look at your pool, and then I'll be on my
    way.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam looked a little disappointed, although Jenny noticed that her ears did seem to prick a
    bit at the mention of her bursting bladder. That set Jenny to wondering and, prompted by
    the memory of her strange dream, she had a deliciously wicked idea about how to deal with
    her uncomfortably full bladder. But she couldn't, could she- supposing she were wrong? It
    could be dreadfully embarrassing. But then again, supposing she was right ...<br>
    <br>
    She began to smile in dreamy anticipation of ecstasy to come.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you want to change into your swimmers, then?&quot; asked Sam brightly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm afraid I don't even possess a swimming costume these days,&quot; Jenny
    confessed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'd lend you one of mine,&quot; said Sam, &quot;if I thought it might fit you. But
    ... &quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I know,&quot; said Jenny. &quot;I'll tell you what, though: I'm wearing matching
    underwear which could easily pass as a bikini. You won't let on, will you, if I come
    swimming in my undies?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Excellent!&quot; cried Sam, clapping her hands excitedly. &quot;Get that dress off,
    then, and let's go swimming!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny hesitated, and tried to look thoughtful.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There's only one slight problem,&quot; she continued.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't really want to walk home in wet underwear,&quot; she explained. &quot;I can
    take my wet bra off, of course, if I really need to; but I don't want to go without
    knickers. Not in this dress. The wind has already lifted the hem once today. It was
    embarrassing enough showing my knickers to the whole world. But I really don't want to be
    showing off my bare butt.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That is a problem, then,&quot; agreed Sam.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is, isn't it,&quot; said Jenny, thoughtfully. &quot;Unless ... &quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes?&quot; said Sam.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; concluded Jenny. &quot;It's a strange thing to ask, I know, but I don't
    suppose you'd happen to have a pair of plastic knickers? I could put them on over my
    knickers so they'd stay dry while I was swimming.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam blushed a bright crimson. &quot;As it happens,&quot; she said, &quot;I do have a pair
    of plastic pants you can borrow. Whatever made you suspect that I might?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Jenny nonchalantly, &quot;it was just an inspired guess.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll go and fetch them for you&quot; said Sam, and disappeared off into the house.<br>
    <br>
    While Sam was gone, Jenny fought a desperate battle to control her bladder. Even without
    the second cup of tea and the huge ice cream of her dream, she was pretty desperate now.
    The last thing she wanted was to wet her knickers before Sam returned. So she scissored
    her legs apart - together - apart - together, squeezing her thighs tight every time her
    legs came together, and that eased it a bit. Then she took off her dress and waited for
    Sam's return.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Here you are,&quot; said Sam, holding a pair of plastic knickers out to Jenny. She
    hesitated a moment, and then continued, &quot;I, er, usually wear them over a nappy, so
    with a bit of luck they'll fit you just fine.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny took the plastic knickers, stepped into them, and pulled them up. They were a snug
    fit. Not too tight, but hopefully tight enough to keep the water away from her jade green
    cotton knickers. Feeling a little self-conscious, she ran a finger around the waist and
    leg bands to make sure that her own knickers weren't sticking out anywhere.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The fit's just about perfect,&quot; she said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let's swim, then!&quot; cried Sam. She turned and ran across the patio, and dived
    into the swimming pool. Jenny followed more carefully, taking mincing little steps as she
    struggled to contain the mounting pressure in her bladder. When she reached the pool, she
    lowered herself carefully into the warm water. It was just as it had been in her dream. As
    the water rose above her waist and closed around her tummy, her straining bladder took
    that as a signal to release its contents and she found herself peeing uncontrollably into
    her jade green cotton knickers. Only this time, instead of leaping out of the water
    sobbing with shame and embarrassment, she allowed herself to relax and enjoy the sensation
    as the warm pee, held captive by her plastic knickers, flowed round her bottom and gently
    caressed her sexual parts, stimulating, arousing. She recalled the second, wet orgasm of
    her dream. She reflected on how much more intense it had been than the first. And she
    desperately hoped that Sam would be willing to help her achieve another.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny waited until she had finished peeing, and then swam across to the other side of the
    pool where Sam was waiting for her, treading water.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sam,&quot; she said. &quot;You'll never guess what I've just done.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What have you just done, Jenny?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She smiled a wicked little conspiratorial grin, and hoped that Sam would notice and
    respond to the lustful gleam in her eye.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've just wet my knickers.&quot;<br>
