    at the Dentist</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    My name is Anna and I have been into watersports for a while. I love filling my bladder to
    capacity and seeing how long I can hold it at home. Anything in public however is off
    limits, I am much too self-conscious to ever try it outside, and always go to the bathroom
    before any emergency arises. This day however was different. On the way back from class I
    stopped for gas and bought myself a large cappuccino, getting ready for a long afternoon
    of studying for midterms before going out with friends that night. As I sat down to study,
    I quickly downed the drink, hoping for a burst of energy, as I had gotten very little
    sleep the past week. A few minutes after I had finished the cappuccino, I casually glanced
    up to the refrigerator when I saw a reminder I had written to myself of a 4:30 dentist
    appointment. I had already canceled once and didn't want to do it again, so I grabbed the
    first clean pair of pants I saw, a pair of old white jeans which no longer really fit, as
    I was just in some old gym shorts and a tank top. I raced out the door, knowing I had 20
    minutes to make a 30 minute drive to the dentist's office.</font><font FACE="Courier New"
    SIZE="2"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">As I sat down in the car I
    could feel the tight pants hugging firmly against me, and could feel a twinge that my
    bladder was beginning to fill. Fifteen minutes later I was starting to panic. My bladder
    had rapidly filled and I had one hand planted firmly against my peehole. I wanted to pull
    over badly, but didn't want to miss my appointment and have to wait an hour until the next
    opening. I finally got there at 4:28 and raced in, asking the lady at the front where the
    bathroom was. She told me I would have to go across the street to the grocery store, as
    this was a small office with only one bathroom, for staff only. I was about to race across
    when I heard, &quot;Anna, come on back&quot; and the hand of the assistant on my shoulder
    guiding me back. As I sat on the chair, I told her I had to use the bathroom and asked if
    I could run across the street quickly. She told me all they had to do was a routine
    check-up and I would be out in ten minutes. With some of the pressure released from
    sitting down, I told myself &quot;Anna, this is ridiculous, you're in college and can hold
    it for ten minutes.&quot; The dentist came in and talked to me for a minute. I felt ok, as
    my legs were crossed and the pain had decreased. Then he said, &quot;alright Anna, let's
    take a look,&quot; and tilted the chair back. As the chair tilted back, all the pressure
    came roaring back like a freight train to my bladder, and I was no longer able to cross my
    legs. I was in complete panic, and with the cleaning now underway, I had know choice but
    to sit through the torture. My thighs were bobbing up and down in unison, and I was
    wringing my hands together constantly, all in an effort to hold back what desperately
    wanted to come out. More than anything I wanted to give my pussy a quick squeeze, but knew
    I couldn't with everyone standing around me. Just when I thought it couldn't get any
    worse, they rested a tray of utensils directly on my bladder. The added wait on my bladder
    caused me to momentarily lose control, and a four second torrent flooded the back of my
    pants and halfway to the knee of my right leg. No one noticed however, and I was forced to
    lay in a puddle of urine-soaked pants. I was sure the seat was wet too, but if I could get
    out of there with no more accidents I would be happy. It didn't happen. As they continued
    to work, one of the assistants leaned across the chair and half slipped, putting her hand
    on my bladder. That's when I leaped up to a sitting position, and placed both hands on my
    pussy, desperate to stop the torrent I could feel coming, tears rolling down my face. It
    was too late. With legs firmly crossed and both hands in my crotch, the torrent came out
    anyway, flooding my pants and the dentist's seat. I had never been so embarrassed in my
    life. The worst part though was the cleaning paste was still on my teeth, so I was forced
    to lay back down in the chair, soaked with urine, so they could take it off. The urine
    trickled down and soaked the back of my shirt, and as I finally walked out, I heard a
    little boy in the waiting room yell out, &quot;she pissed her pants&quot; and everyone was
    staring. I ran out and drove home, totally distraught but highly aroused too, and I
    fingered myself to orgasm on the way home.</font></p>
