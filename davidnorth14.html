    <br>
    Rachael would have given anything to thrust her hands between her legs and press her
    fingers against her pee-hole, but sitting at a supermarket checkout, it was not possible
    to hold herself without everyone seeing. And yet she would have to do something soon or
    she would piss her jeans before her shift ended at ten.<br>
    <br>
    The damned place was always short of staff, and her stints on the checkout were always far
    longer than they were supposed to be. She had started this session at five o'clock to cope
    with the influx of customers who stopped to shop for groceries on the way home from work.
    John Smithers, the supermarket manager, had promised that the evening staff would turn up
    by six and she would be free to leave for the day. But then three of the girls who were
    supposed to be working didn't show up, and back-up staff had not answered their phones. As
    a result, only three checkouts were in operation, and the queues were both long and
    endless.<br>
    <br>
    Smithers had come to see her just before six and informed her that she would have to work
    the evening shift because they were so short-handed. Rachael had complained vociferously,
    and Smithers had mollified her by promising double-time if she worked until the store
    closed at 10 p.m. The money would be useful, and so Rachael had agreed. She had not
    expected to have to work out without evening a break for the loo.<br>
    <br>
    By eight o'clock, her stomach had started aching, but at least the desire to pee had been
    manageable at that point. Now, after an hour of steady filling and expanding, her bladder
    was screaming for relief. There was no way she could hold on for another hour before
    visiting the loo.<br>
    <br>
    Rachael crossed her legs and leaned forward on her seat, squeezing her external urethral
    sphincter as hard as she could. So much depended on this small, circular muscle, the only
    voluntary control a woman possesses to resist the desire to urinate when the internal
    sphincter relaxed in response to contracting bladder muscles. She scanned items, ran
    credit cards and tried to keep up a friendly conversation with each new customer.<br>
    <br>
    At one point, Rachael noticed a blonde-haired woman in her mid-twenties hopping around in
    the queue at her checkout, and realized that the woman was also dying to go to the loo. It
    was hardly surprising: the public toilets in the shop had been closed since mid-afternoon
    owing to a burst water pipe. A plumber had been scheduled to fix it, but still had not
    turned up. There was probably more than one customer dealing with an uncomfortable
    bladder.<br>
    <br>
    This woman looked particularly distracted, however, and glancing down at her legs, Rachael
    saw that she was walking on the spot. She also had a shopping trolley filled to the brim.
    She was clearly going to have to wait for some time, and it looked like she was going to
    have a lot of trouble with that. In a perverse way, the woman's predicament made Rachael
    feel a little better about her own mounting desperation to pee. A burden shared, and all
    that.<br>
    <br>
    As she continued scanning goods, Rachael cast occasional glances at the desperate woman.
    She was a smartly dressed business type, the type that would normally look cool and
    professional. For her to be fidgeting this much, she had to be practically breaking her
    neck for a piss.<br>
    <br>
    When it was the woman's turn, she began loading her items onto the conveyor. Rachael could
    not see that she was standing with her knees pressed firmly together, leaning over the
    trolley as she lifted her selections out. Bending like that must have help a little,
    Rachael thought, and suddenly felt the urge to re-cross her own legs. Glancing at the
    clock and finding the time was still only nine-twenty, Rachael suppressed a moan. She was
    almost pissing her knickers now, and waiting another forty minutes just wasn't possible.
    What the hell was she going to do? If she ran to the loo and left the checkout unattended,
    Smithers would probably fire her. Why didn't the fat fuck come and offer to take over for
    a couple of minutes to give her a break? She hadn't even set eyes on him for the past
    hour. Probably in the staff room watching football, she decided resentfully.<br>
    <br>
    Rachael's attention was tugged back to the woman in the business suit. Had she just let
    out a little gasp? On the periphery of her vision, Rachael noticed the woman bend her
    right knee for a moment, then cross her legs as she reached down into the trolley for the
    last few items. When the trolley was empty, she pushed it forward out of her way and then
    opened her purse to take out her credit card. Rachael slowed down the rate at which she
    was processing the woman's goods, wanting to see how she would cope with having to stand
    there and wait.<br>
    <br>
    The woman swiped her card and Rachael saw on her display that her name was Jayne Thomas.
    The machine would be telling Jayne to wait for the cashier. As she went on scanning,
    Rachael asked, &quot;Did you find everything you were looking for?&quot; She could hear
    the strain in her voice as she struggled to suppress the urge to release her pee into her
    jeans.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; Jayne replied, her voice also tense. She was staring off into
    the distance, Rachael observed, no doubt concentrating hard to avoid leaking into her
    clothes. Jayne shifted her legs then, the front of her skirt creasing as she bent a
    little. She had to be really bursting. At least she would soon be able to do something
    about it, Rachael thought bitterly, while she herself would have to wait for another half
    hour or more.<br>
    <br>
    At last, Rachael finished scanning items and brought up the total. She authorized the
    credit card transaction then waited for approval, watching Jayne's left hand close into a
    fist. She clenched it so hard that her knuckles turned white. The transaction was
    approved, and Rachael tore off the receipt and handed it to Jayne for a signature. As she
    leaned forward to sign, Jayne blew out her cheeks and released a sharp breath. Did that
    mean she had just started to piss herself?<br>
    <br>
    At last, Rachael handed the final receipt to Jayne who offered a stiff thank you in
    return, before grabbing her trolley and pushing it rapidly out into the car park. As she
    started processing the next customer, Rachael stole several looks through the window,
    seeing Jayne unloading her shopping into the back of a blue Honda while dancing around in
    her high heels. She was going to have to drive like that, Rachael realized, and she
    wondered if Jayne would make it home before she wet herself all over the car seat.<br>
    <br>
    Rachael's thoughts turned back to her own desperation. She was keeping her thighs firmly
    clenched together, but she had come to the very brink of wetting her knickers now. She
    pushed down on the balls of her feet, wiggling her knees up and down, fighting to maintain
    control of her muscles. Twenty-five more minutes... before she could go. Oh God, there was
    no way she could hold it in that long. She had to get Smithers out here to relieve her at
    her post before she pissed herself.<br>
    <br>
    Taking up the intercom mike from beneath her desk, she said in a quivering voice,
    &quot;Would Mr. Smithers come to the checkout, please. Mr. Smithers to the checkout.&quot;
    She knew the old miser wouldn't like it, but she didn't have any choice. She had to get to
    the loo!<br>
    <br>
    Rachael continued processing the shopping for the next customer, biting her lower lip as
    she worked. The pain helped to take her mind off her bursting bladder a little, but it
    wouldn't work for long. She was absolutely bursting. She glanced towards the back of the
    shop and the door marked STAFF ONLY. Where the hell was Smithers?<br>
    <br>
    Something made Rachael turn to look through the front window of the store. The blue Honda
    was still there, and Jayne Thomas was just getting back out of it. Why was she still here?
    Rachael processed another credit card, glancing outside every few seconds while she
    waited. Jayne was on her way back into the shop, walking very stiffly. God, she had been
    so desperate to piss, Rachael thought, and wondered what had delayed the woman's
    departure.<br>
    <br>
    Just as the customer was signing the card receipt, Jayne approached Rachael's till.
    &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she began, crossing her legs as she spoke. &quot;Is there a ph--oh!
    Phone I can use? My car won't start, and my-oooh, my cell's battery's flat.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry, no,&quot; Rachael informed her.<br>
    <br>
    Jayne closed her eyes for a moment as she received this bad news. She uncrossed her legs
    and bent her right leg, raising her knee as she brought the tow of her shoe down and
    tapped it on the floor. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said after a short pause. &quot;Is there a
    staff loo I could use?&quot; she asked. &quot;I really need to go, and your public one is
    closed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I know,&quot; Rachael said. &quot;I'm afraid customers aren't allowed back
    there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Listen,&quot; Jayne said sharply. &quot;This is an emergency, or I wouldn't ask. You
    have to make an exception.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't--,&quot; Rachael began, then heard Smithers' voice behind her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What was the call for, Rachael?&quot; he demanded shortly. &quot;I'm busy and don't
    have time for this.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry,&quot; Rachael addressed him while keeping an eye on Jayne's frantic
    gyrations. &quot;I just need someone to relieve me for a few minutes while I go to the
    loo.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good God,&quot; Smithers retorted. &quot;Your shift ends in twenty minutes. Surely
    you can wait until then?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Actually, I've been waiting a long time, and I really need to go.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't be ridiculous,&quot; Smithers said. &quot;You can't leave your post at this
    late stage, and I have to get back to take an important phone call.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But this lady needs to use the loo too,&quot; Rachael added quickly as Smithers
    began turning away.<br>
    <br>
    Smithers glanced at Jayne then shook his head. &quot;I'm sorry, madam,&quot; he said,
    &quot;but we're not permitted to let members of the public into the back, for insurance
    reasons.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But your public toilets are closed!&quot; Jayne objected frantically. &quot;Can't
    you make an exception this once?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Smithers repeated.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But I have to go,&quot; Jayne insisted. &quot;Now!&quot; She reinforced her plea by
    bending at the waist and turning her bent right knee in so that it pressed against the
    left. &quot;Please!&quot; she added when Smithers continued prevaricating.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm really desperate too,&quot; Rachael chimed in.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey,&quot; the man at the front of Rachael's queue piped up. &quot;Let the poor kid
    take a leak. You can see she's desperate.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A murmur of assent rippled along the queue, and Smithers eyed them all with
    barely-suppressed exasperation. He turned to Jayne and said, &quot;Alright, you can use
    the staff toilet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, thank God!&quot; Jayne gasped as she straightened her bent leg and took several
    steps towards the back of the shop. When Smithers didn't immediately follow, she stopped
    and waited for him, tapping her heels on the floor in an urgent little dance, her lips
    puckering as she fought to hold back the torrent that threatened to erupt between her
    thighs at any moment.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You'll have to wait until ten,&quot; Smithers informed Rachael.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh no,&quot; she gasped, her expression one of strained anguish. &quot;I can't hold
    it any longer.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ten o'clock,&quot; Smithers insisted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can't do that,&quot; the customer at the front of the queue spoke up again.
    &quot;That ain't legal.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Smithers gave him a withering stare and then turned to stride away, with Jayne hobbling
    along behind him, her body bending at the waist and her hands pressed against her abdomen.<br>
    <br>
    Rachael's eyes brimmed with tears as she finally succumbed to the urge to ram her hands
    between her legs, pressing hard on her pee-hole. &quot;Oh God,&quot; she whimpered as she
    felt warm pee jet through her jeans and soak her fingers. &quot;No,&quot; no, no,&quot;
    she repeated over and over, fighting, squirming, struggling to hold the rest of her pee
    inside. It was no good: her bladder was stretched as far as it could go, and couldn't hold
    any more. It felt so huge and tight that Rachael couldn't bear the pressure any longer.
    She put up a last, valiant struggle, but pee rushed through her knickers and streamed over
    her squeezing fingers. There was nothing she could do to stop herself peeing in her jeans.<br>
    <br>
    The man on the opposite side of the conveyor watched as the blue of Rachael's denims grew
    darker as she soaked them in pee. The girl's face was so red. She couldn't bring herself
    to face any of the customers. She was pissing all over her chair and the floor inside her
    little cubicle. It was snaking across the floor towards the front of the shop, a long,
    thin river of yellowish liquid. Her humiliation was total.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;He should get fired for making you pee yourself like this,&quot; the man said.
    &quot;If you want to do something about it, I'll be a witness.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Me too,&quot; said the woman immediately behind him. &quot;What that man did to you
    is appalling. He should be reprimanded.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Kicked in the bloody bollocks, more like,&quot; said the man.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Th-thank you,&quot; Rachael stammered. &quot;I...I'm really sorry, but you'll have
    to go to another checkout.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's alright, love,&quot; the man said. &quot;You can ring my stuff up if you want.
    I don't mind.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But...I...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't leave your post,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Don't give him a reason to sack
    you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Rachael sighed, and even though she was still blushing with embarrassment, she began
    processing the man's shopping, aware that she was handling packages with pee-soaked
    fingers. The man really didn't seem to mind, however; he smiled encouragingly at her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's the spirit,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't let the bastard grind you down.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Hearing heels tapping along the floor, Rachael looked round to find Jayne on her way out
    of the shop. The woman paused when she saw Rachael's soaking wet jeans, and scowled at the
    door at the back of the shop. She approached Rachael and said, &quot;Your boss is a total
    prick.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right,&quot; Rachael agreed sullenly.<br>
    <br>
    Jayne hesitated, and then leaned her mouth close to Rachael's ear. &quot;If it helps any,
    I didn't quite make it either. My underwear is thoroughly wet where I lost control. I only
    just managed to get my skirt up out of the way in time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Rachael nodded and smiled. Yes, it did help, a little. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she answered as
    Jayne straightened up and left the shop, still needing to deal with her car problem.<br>
    <br>
    Rachael handled all the customers at her till, and not one of them complained about the
    smell or the fact that she had peed herself on the job. At five minutes after ten, the
    doors were closed, and relieved, in more ways than one, Rachael finally went back to the
    STAFF ONLY area and went into the ladies to clean herself up as best she could before
    going home. She only hoped the combination of her coat and the fact that it was dark out
    would hide the worst of her accident.<br>
    <br>
    Outside, she walked over to Jayne and said, &quot;Do you want a lift home? If you don't
    mind the smell of my pissy jeans that is.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, yes. That's so kind,&quot; Jayne responded. &quot;And I wouldn't worry about the
    smell. My knickers don't smell too healthy either.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay. Let's get your shopping into my car.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right. Then, on the way home, we can discuss what you ought to do about your boss. I
    know I'm going to write to your head office about him.&quot; After a pause, Jayne added,
    &quot;Has this ever happened to you before? Wetting yourself in public?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, a couple of times,&quot; Rachael admitted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, it happens to me a lot,&quot; Jayne informed her young companion candidly.
    &quot;I must have weak bladder muscles or something, because I always seem to be getting
    desperate when I'm out and there are no loos around. But, we can talk about that in the
    car too.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sure,&quot; Rachael agreed, aware that she was again reacting to this woman's
    problem with peeing. She wondered if she was discovering something that she had not
    formerly realized about herself, and also wondered where it might ultimately lead...<br>
