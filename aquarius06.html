    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I shouldn't be in this situation. I
    mean, I'm a big girl, doing well at work, mother of two, knows how to plan for the future.
    I shouldn't be in this situation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The subway moves into the station,
    doors open. Unfortunately it's not my station.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Like I said, I'm not the one who
    gets herself in a predicament like this. I'm used to thinking ahead, both at home and at
    work, and I know that certain things are to be taken into consideration at an early stage.
    But now I'm sitting here, staining my muscles, wishing I'd taken the necessary steps.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Oh Jesus, I nearly...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was late out of work. You know,
    just this, that and then something else. Always the one who has to finish things properly.
    Oh, the time. My train! Better run! Thought I would make it, only ten minutes worth of
    brisk walking to the station, nine if I'm in a real hurry. Damn the slow clock on the
    reception wall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I shift on the seat.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pick up my purse, grab my jacket -
    oh, maybe I'd just describe myself to you. Brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, my
    husband says a nice body but never a model. Today- dressed in white blouse, beige pants
    (quite tight, with a high waist), and a jacket to go with it. Dark red underwear: Lace bra
    and thong panties. I prefer not to show panty lines under such close-fitting pants. Shoes
    with a bit of a heel - don't help you when catching a train, do they?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I feel like unbuttoning to ease the
    pressure, but I'm a big girl.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Anyway, I raced for the station,
    after deciding there was no time for a visit to the girls' room. Damn clock. The train
    left as I reached the platform. A girl like me shouldn't curse like that. I brushed my
    hair back and prepared to wait for half an hour. The first fifteen minutes passed without
    trouble, but then I really regretted not having been to the loo. Excuse me, to the
    bathroom. I'm a mother; two beautiful girls of seven and five, and frankly, something kind
    of weakened me after two births, meaning that I have to go when I have to go. And there
    are no lavatories on the subway stations.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I try crossing my legs. Oh shit,
    that was close.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My girls are well out of diapers,
    they use the bathroom by themselves, and I always make sure they go before we leave the
    house. So I shouldn't be in this situation. I tried not to bounce about while waiting, but
    pressing my knees together seemed to help. The thong sort of rubbed my - I mean, it fits
    quite closely and moving means that - oh well, I kind of felt it all the time. I tried
    inserting my thumb in the lining of my pants to pull it off my tummy, but it was too
    obvious. Should I sit down? I feared I would not be able to get up without consequences.
    So I hold on, twenty-eight years old, not to go potty in my pants.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I put the purse on my lap and risk a
    little help from my hand. It gives me shivers. The train moves oh so slowly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When Pammie wet her pants at six I
    was quite cross. Never again, darling, sorry! I never felt such intense pressure before,
    never been so close to disaster. I tried to walk a bit to take my mind off my bladder, and
    to keep from clutching myself. Must have been a strange sight, this well-dressed woman
    wriggling up and down the platform, bottom sticking out, and desperation in her eyes. I
    began dreaming of the sea, where I admit to enjoying letting go freely when the need
    comes. It takes only a slight relaxation...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I find myself caressing my hips in
    anticipation. Stop! I won't ever do it!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The train arrived, fifty-three
    seconds late. I boarded gingerly, and here I am, in a tight place. Ten minutes to go.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And I dare not think about the
    thirty-minute walk home.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The train slows down. Next to the
    last station. Two girls get on, giggling, joking, smiling; sitting down across the aisle.
    Words drift over: &quot;and I nearly peed myself when...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Little do they know.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At last. I dare not get up before
    the train stands still, afraid of sudden jolts. Slightly bent I stagger out of the train,
    minding my steps. I head for the exit, one step at a time. Every step a poke in my
    bladder. I breathe deeply, concentrating on holding. Pain eases. I walk on- chest high,
    bottom out. Up the stairs, down to the left, and across the street, praying for green
    lights all the way.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then the waves hit again, and I have
    to stop. Oh, what bliss to let go! But I'm a big girl; I don't wee in my clothes. I fight
    the urge and move on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Two blocks. Three. I can make it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly, I feel a warm sensation in
    my crotch. God, I peed myself! Nothing shows, but the wetness in my panties rubs against
    me as I walk.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another block. And - please! -
    Another involuntary release. I look around me, nobody close enough to see. There is a
    small wet patch between my legs. Mommy's peeing herself!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I increase my pace; realizing speed
    is the essence here. Time is running out. I turn off the main street, heading for the
    residential areas. Not a café in sight, but lots of tempting bushes and shrubbery. No
    way. Again the pressure builds; again my aching muscles give in. This time a telltale
    dribble down my leg, and the dark rose must be obvious to everybody. My sex feels warm, I
    hold myself to try to hide the pee stain.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I don't care about appearances
    anymore. I walk with my legs tightly pressed together, hand in crotch, feeling yet another
    dribble. The warm liquid runs between my fingers. With all my strength I hold back, at
    last having the familiar gate in sight. While unlatching I twist and wriggle, cross my
    legs, and then I'm inside. Twenty paces to the door. The joy of being home paralyses me, I
    stand in the driveway, unable to move, knowing that one movement will release it all. I
    stand with both hands between my legs, sobbing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What's the use? I'll never reach the
    bathroom anyway. I long to let go. Big girl is going to wee her pants. Yes, I'm going to
    wet myself right here.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I'm painfully conscious of the
    strange contrasting feelings in my crotch. My nipples are stiff against the lace; my pussy
    is throbbing. I'm warm all over, all hot and cozy. I look down at the dark patch growing
    in my groin, enjoying every second of relief, letting go of every drop of my warm pee,
    crying with shame and pleasure, wetting my pants like a little girl. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><strong><em><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sequel<o:p></o:p></span></font></em></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I didn't tell my husband, afraid of
    his reaction to this childish predicament. I put my wet clothes in the washing machine,
    changing into my favorite faded Levi's and t-shirt. The jeans were worn to a perfect fit
    by years of use and the additional couple of pounds I'd put on since I acquired them.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After dinner I sat down by the PC in
    the basement to finish a project (yes, I bring my work home), sipping tea and delving into
    some interesting ideas. An hour later my bladder gave its first warning signal, but being
    so absorbed and feeling secure in the short way (two floors up) to the bathroom I ignored
    it. Even though my experience earlier in the day had made a thorough impression- in many
    ways.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I kept writing, sitting the way I
    use to when I'm deeply engaged, with legs under the chair, perched on the edge of the seat
    with my bottom slightly raised. Clicking the SAVE icon for the last time the urge really
    hit me as my body and mind relaxed and took notice of the outside world. Or, rather, the
    inside. God, I needed to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had to grab myself as I stumbled
    up the stairs. It came so quickly! Evidently my muscles were so strained after my long
    holding they couldn't take the pressure one more time. Passing through the sitting room
    where my husband was watching TV I had to stop and cross my legs. He looked up.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">His eyes widened.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I felt the warmth again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He opened his mouth to speak, but I
    couldn't hear him, only the soft dripping on the floor. My legs trembled as the stain grew
    on the front of my jeans, and I managed to stem the flow. With a lump in my throat I
    looked at him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The shock and surprise had grown
    into something different. The look of apprehension and compassion gave way to love and
    desire. The warm smile that originated in the eyes spread to his whole face.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I managed a weak smile. Then I let
    go.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
