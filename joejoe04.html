    Female Desperation.</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><br>
    This story was told to me by a friend who attends a small college of about 1200 students:<o:p></o:p></font></span><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I lived in the biggest dorm of all
    of them. It was an all female dorm and there were 50 of us living there. It was the oldest
    dorm on campus and originally the only one. Since it had been built for far fewer students
    many rooms had been converted into living quarters, leaving only one toilet for all 50 of
    us.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Weekday mornings were the worst. I
    would wake up with that full feeling in my bladder just bursting to go, never knowing how
    long the line at the toilet would be. It was unfortunately in the same room as the shower,
    which made waiting times even longer since girls would go in there and shower and pee and
    brush every morning.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One night I came home drunk and fell
    right asleep. I woke up the next morning around 9AM needing a pee worse than ever, having
    had drunk so much the night before without a trip to the bathroom. I clenched my pussy
    tightly and ran out of my room, not even realizing that I had taken off my pants and shirt
    the night before in the heat. All I was wearing was a pair of tight panties and a bra. I
    was bent over clenching as hard as I possibly could while running to the toilet.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I ran over to the toilet and saw
    about 7 girls on line and heard one in the shower. I pleaded with the girls in front of me
    if I could pass them in line, &quot;PLEEEEZE!!! I HAFTA PEEEE SOOOO BAD!!!&quot; They
    responded, &quot;Yea and so do all of us!!&quot; There was no way I was going to make it
    long enough to wait for all these girls to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I ran out of my dorm, despite the
    way i was dressed and ran over to my boyfriend's dorm. The main doors were locked as they
    always were so I yelled up to his room and he came down to open the door for me. He was
    shocked at the way I was dressed and I ran up passed him. All the guys in the dorm were
    staring at me, but I didn't care. All I wanted to do was pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Girls weren't supposed to use the
    guys' bathrooms and to be honest I didn't even know where they were. I ran through the
    dorm aimlessly, half-naked with my hand jammed in my pussy for a couple of minutes
    desperately seeking a place to relieve myself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
