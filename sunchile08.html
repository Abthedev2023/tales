    <br>
    After what had seemed like an interminable Friday of classes at the NYU Downtown Campus,
    Katie McDonald, a 21-year-old graduate student in political economics, neatly arranged her
    books and materials in her tote pack and strode confidently out toward Washington Square.
    During the walk, she exchanged pleasantries with her classmates Rita Kudner and Boyd
    Hamilton, though declined an invitation to a student sleepover at someone's parents' house
    on the Upper East Side. Katie had other things in mind.<br>
    <br>
    Nearing the park, Katie managed to disengage from Rita and Boyd, who were heading for the
    subway. She strode over to a bench on the west side of the park, straightened her
    medium-length navy blue skirt and India print blouse, and settled in to wait for her older
    lover, Galen Morgan. Katie liked the way the yellow flowers on her blouse accented her
    long, pale blond hair.<br>
    <br>
    The eldest daughter of a senior defense analyst, a retired Colonel in Bethesda, Maryland,
    Katie had grown up in the heart of a secure, loving Irish-American family. She enjoyed the
    company of her student companions only in brief doses. For her weekends, Katie preferred
    more mature company who could emulate the steady confidence she had enjoyed at home with
    her adoring father. Slender, blonde, almost angular in physique, Katie had been well aware
    since her early teens that she could have anyone she wanted.<br>
    <br>
    Galen appeared across the park almost within a minute of their appointed time. This being
    the City, Katie and Galen didn't bother with particular efforts to keep their relationship
    secret, but neither did they want to flaunt it. By this hour, most of Katie's student
    acquaintances would be well on their way to uptown, Brooklyn, or Queens apartments. Katie
    enjoyed watching Galen approach her in his rough-cut sailing gear and jacket.<br>
    <br>
    Galen arrived at the bench, and Katie stood to embrace him in a long, tender, full-bodied
    hug. Her nagging need to void her bladder, developed during the last hour of class, did
    nothing to diminish the fervor of her embrace. Rather, it seemed to add to her excitement.
    After disengaging, Galen told her, &quot;I picked up a little something for you this
    morning when I happened to be wandering up by the Diamond District on Fifth Avenue. I hope
    you like it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie knew there would be no question but that she would like it. Galen's taste in gifts
    could only be matched by his generosity. She accepted the six-inch package wrapped in
    silver paper and bearing a tag &quot;Pastor Geneve, Antwerp,&quot; gingerly and
    appreciatively. What could it be? Opening the package, careful to preserve the integrity
    of the paper, Katie discovered it contained a small jewel box. Opening the box revealed a
    brilliant, sparkling yellow diamond set in a finely crafted cloisonné pendant setting.
    She gasped at the discovery, and then smiled appreciatively up at Galen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's our color,&quot; said Galen.<br>
    <br>
    Katie knew exactly what Galen implied. During the excitement of her gift, she had somewhat
    lost control of her bladder function. Small but warm rivulets were moistening her inner
    thighs.<br>
    <br>
    Galen, ever the pleaser, reached into a package he was carrying, and withdrew a pint-sized
    bottle of Moet and Chandon champagne. &quot;Oh, you do think of everything,&quot; Katie
    purred.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let's toast to the evening ahead,&quot; offered Galen. He pulled the plastic cork
    and they shared a drink from a paper cup.<br>
    <br>
    Galen was the older lover Katie had long hoped for. At 21, she really wasn't interested in
    a committed or confining relationship. There was too much life to be lived. After
    receiving her masters, she had planned a year in Europe, then a stint working for an NGO
    in whatever capacity her degree would permit.<br>
    <br>
    Galen, at 43, was legally separated from his wife, though devotedly committed to her well
    being and that of their two children. The founder of a highly successful real-estate
    company, he had achieved a level of affluence that afforded him the ability to maintain
    the Florida family home as well as one on the Connecticut coast. Katie loved it when he
    invited her up there for a weekend of sailing on his skiff.<br>
    <br>
    Katie had been attracted to Galen from the moment they met, at a house party of one of her
    professors. His hard, fit sailor's frame and tousled sandy-colored hair were not small
    factors in the attraction. What really drove her wild, as they had become better
    acquainted, was his exceptional expertise in the art of making love.<br>
    <br>
    Since childhood, Katie had always experienced a slight problem in maintaining continence.
    Emotional and Irish in temperament, she would frequently feel a sudden urge to urinate
    when excited or frightened. The natural intensity of her character also engendered a
    tendency to ignore her need to urinate almost to the point where arriving at a facility
    was impossible.<br>
    <br>
    Not long after they had began dating, Katie and Galen had found themselves engaged in some
    light but intense necking while watching a cable movie in his hotel room. Katie had lost
    track of the effect that successful toasts of champagne had on her anatomy, and had
    experienced a pretty serious accident, wetting her clothes profusely. Galen had scarcely
    missed a beat, but had picked her up and made fierce, passionate love to her in the
    adjoining bedroom of the suite, not even bothering to remove her soaked panties but simply
    sliding the crotch aside.<br>
    <br>
    That night, Katie experienced a sort of epiphany, indeed, a fundamental change in her
    sexual response pattern that would hold fast throughout her subsequent sexual activity. A
    deluge of hot liquid accompanied the massively intense orgasm she enjoyed with Galen from
    her vagina that Katie knew not to be urine. From that night on, whenever Katie would cum,
    she would gush. This engendered some embarrassment and confusion with the few college boys
    Katie infrequently enjoyed between engagements with Galen. They tended to respond with
    choking and stammering. Some felt outright disgusted.<br>
    <br>
    But Katie rightly recognized her tendency to gush during orgasm as the realization of her
    full sexual potential. No longer would she feel the need to desperately struggle against
    the urge to urinate when she felt excited, though she remained fully capable of
    maintaining continence when the situation required. She could use that excitement to
    augment and intensify a tremendous orgasmic release.<br>
    <br>
    This factor had not been lost on Galen as he had plied her with champagne that night in
    the hotel. He had been mentored in the delights of wet sex by an older French woman while
    vacationing with his parents in Nice.<br>
    <br>
    Night was falling on Washington Square Park, providing a blanket of some privacy as Galen
    poured another cupful of champagne, sat down next to Katie, and reached into her loosely
    fitting blouse to sample her small, pert, supple breasts. Katie took a small swallow and
    hugged Galen's neck with her free arm, thanking him for a lovely afternoon. It was dark,
    and they were secluded enough so that Galen could reach down and lightly rest two fingers
    on the gusset of Katie's moist panties. A brief but noticeable stream of warm urine,
    further thanking him for the pleasure and significantly increasing his passion, met his
    fingers. Galen removed his fingers from beneath Katie's skirt and sucked them sensually
    between his lips. He loved the taste of Katie's warm, recycled champagne.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Shall we adjourn to the parlor?&quot; suggested Galen, meaning Katie's small
    apartment in a somewhat distant cooperative in the East Village.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I find that a marvelous suggestion,&quot; answered Katie, standing up and checking
    to make sure that her urinary indiscretion did not show on her skirt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Taxi or ankle power?&quot; queried Galen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I think tonight we walk,&quot; answered Katie. She was clearly aware that before
    they reached her apartment, she would be feeling a state of desperation that would vastly
    intensify the experience to come.<br>
    <br>
    Galen and Katie strode off arm-in-arm. By the time they neared her apartment, she was
    shooting occasional waves of hot urine down her legs, but by no means had totally lost
    control. That would be reserved for later.<br>
    <br>
    Arriving at her apartment door, Katie turned to Galen and pleaded, &quot;Would you please
    help me with the locks? I don't quite think I could manage them 'in my condition.'&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;My pleasure, mademoiselle,&quot; Galen replied, as he removed the keys from her
    pack, fiddled with the locks, and led the &quot;distressed maiden&quot; across the living
    room straight into the bedroom. They both knew recognized the necessity of some haste in
    order to take full advantage of the situation.<br>
    <br>
    At bedside, Katie exclaimed, &quot;You know, I really am bursting. Unhhhhhhhhh! She bent
    her legs slightly to briefly expel a long, thick stream of urine from beneath her skirt.
    This added markedly to Galen's excitement. He hastily removed both of their clothes and
    pulled Katie onto the bed with him, helping her to straddle him in the female dominant
    position.<br>
    <br>
    In a flash, Galen entered Katie's hot, tight woman sheath, which was soaked not only from
    her incontinence, but was also slick with feminine lubrication. Given the latitude to move
    about freely, Katie thrashed wildly above Galen. Their cries and moans could easily be
    heard 2-3 stories above.<br>
    <br>
    At a given moment, Katie thrust the heels of her hands hard against Galen's chest, as the
    grasping pulsations of a cataclysmic orgasm alternately gripped and released his hot,
    throbbing member. This was followed by a liquid wave of practically tsunami proportions as
    a mixture of urine and female ejaculate pour from between Katie's legs to soak Galen from
    toes to chest, the bed, and even puddled on the floor. Fortunately, a plastic mattress
    cover protected the bed.<br>
    <br>
    As her contractions subsided, Katie and Galen collapsed into a mass of giggling and
    guffawing people flesh, before she jumped up and ran to the refrigerator for some
    champagne to start the whole process going again.<br>
