    Ferry</b><p>Well, you might have heard of the song, &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;
    (Johnny and the Pacemakers) about the trip on the Mersey river in Liverpool. It was a nice
    sunny day yesterday - the first we&#146;ve had here for ages, so I took the ferry to
    Liverpool and back for some fresh air. It takes about an hour, all told. I hadn&#146;t
    been to the toilet since the night before and realized almost as soon as I got on the boat
    that I would need to pee. It didn&#146;t bother me as I enjoy feeling full, and anyway
    there were toilets on the boat in case I got desperate. Well, believe it or not, the
    toilets were being repaired, both the men&#146;s and the ladies&#146; rooms! I was getting
    desperate, I thought I&#146;d be able to make it back but after leaving Liverpool and
    heading back home I knew that I was going to have real trouble holding it. I had on a
    skirt, a t-shirt, and a denim jacket as I sat upstairs at the front of the boat where
    there are few seats and I was up there alone. The seats are wooden with slats going across
    and space between down to the deck sort of like a box. My stomach was really starting to
    hurt and the splashing of the boat on the water was not helping. I actually considered
    sitting on the rail and letting it go over the side but they don&#146;t let people do that
    anymore, as too many people have fallen overboard, so I raised my skirt, didn&#146;t worry
    about my knickers and began to let a little hot stream out. It felt hot and wonderful! I
    could hear it splashing in the seat but you couldn&#146;t see it, anyway, I was enjoying
    the feeling soooo much. I didn&#146;t realize that I had nearly totally emptied my
    bladder, there was a dark wet trail coming out from under the seat and running right along
    the deck, but it felt so good, that I went ahead and finished off. When I was done I
    started to rub my clit as it was really throbbing - anyway I really was about to orgasm
    when these two guys walked around the corner onto the front deck. I nearly died. I stood
    up, letting my skirt fall as I made my way to the back of the boat to finish bringing
    myself off. I had an amazing wet orgasm while letting the last bit of hot pee run down my
    legs. </p>
    <p>What an experience, not something I will forget in a hurry. Wonder what those two guys
    made of it all!</font></p>
