    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was babysitting with a friend of
    mine one day in the park. We were watching two 3-year-old girls. It was a hot summer day
    so we (my friend and I) had each had three 22 OZ. cokes. About half an hour later I began
    to feel the urge to pee. I ignored it and figured we would be leaving soon. About 45
    minutes later my urge was getting to a state of emergency so I figured we had better get
    going. I told the two girls it was time to go and they started crying and begging to stay.
    Marcy, my friend, said, &quot;Oh come on just let them play a bit more!&quot; I figured
    I'd wait.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another 20 minutes went by. I was in
    urgent need now of a place to pee. I knew that even if we left then with the walking speed
    of those kids we wouldn't be home for at least 30 minutes. It was a last resort, but I
    figured I had better use the public restroom. Uggh. That was going to be nasty. The ones
    in the park are just unbearable.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I went over to the restrooms only to
    find them locked. I banged on the door in desperation, but it was no use. There was a sign
    up that they were out of order. I could feel the pressure on my bladder so strong. I could
    feel my pee on the verge of bursting out into my panties. I went back over to Marcy and
    blurted out &quot;Ok we really must go now I REALLY HAFTA PEE BAAAD!!!&quot; She said she
    had to also and suggested we use the public restrooms. I said they weren't open and she
    said, &quot;Oh my gosh! I was planning on using them before we left. I don't know if I can
    last until we get back!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We told the children it was time to
    go and they put up such a fuss. They kept whining and running away and we had to keep
    chasing them (not easy on a full bladder). Finally, after 20 VERY long minutes we began to
    leave the park.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We began walking back and I was
    right! Those kids walk slowly!! They wanted to walk and wouldn't let us carry them. This
    was going to be tough. It was worse than I had expected though. The walk didn't take the
    expected 30 minutes; it took 45!! I was absolutely bursting by the time we got back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The only problem was that Marcy also
    had to go real bad and they only had one bathroom. I was going to have to try to make it
    in there first. We got inside the apartment and I rushed in ahead of Marcy and got to the
    bathroom door in a hurry, only to find that it was locked. I banged on the door in
    desperation and a voice came from inside &quot;I'll be out in a minute.&quot; Uggh. It was
    the girls' older sister. I danced around waiting for five minutes or so, barely able to
    keep my composure.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then the toilet flushed, a sound
    that just made the pain worse. She finally came out and I rushed in, only to notice that
    one of the girls I was sitting for had followed me. I asked her nicely to get out and she
    replied, &quot;I want to use the potty like a big girl.&quot; I said, &quot;Ok, but not
    now you'll have to wait, ok?&quot; she said, &quot;No!! I want to go NOW!!!&quot; I was
    trying not to wet myself at the same time as trying to get her out of the bathroom. It
    wasn't easy and I figured it might be easier if I just helped her use the potty and then
    relieved myself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I pulled her training pants down for
    her and sat her up on the toilet. My oh so desperate pussy throbbed as I waited
    desperately!! She just sat there. After what must have been 5 minutes I said to her
    &quot;Are you sure you have to go?&quot; &quot;YES!!&quot; she replied. I waited. After
    another two minutes there was finally a trickle in the toilet and then I urgently said,
    &quot;Ok. All finished.&quot; and she replied, &quot;No! I'm not done yet.&quot; I was on
    the verge of wetting myself and I didn't know what to do. Marcy screamed from outside,
    &quot;ARE YOU ALMOST DONE YET?!!! I'M REAL, REAL DESPERATE OUT HERE!!!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I couldn't even scream back. All my
    concentration was on keeping my desperate pussy under control. Another 5 minutes went by
    and more pee began to trickle into the toilet. That was it...I lost it. I began peeing in
    my pants. I didn't know what to do so I jumped in the shower, closed the curtain, and just
    peed all over the tub. Marcy began to bang on the door. &quot;OHHHHHHHHH my GOSH&quot; she
    screamed and burst in, completely soaking herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Needless to say, we never showed our
    faces at their house again!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
