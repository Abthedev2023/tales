    <font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">My girlfriend and I
    had often indulged in various watersports activities. On one particular night Jenny had
    asked me to refuse her access to a loo so she could see how much she could hold. She knew
    she&#146;d end up begging me to let her go but I was determined that no matter what this
    girl with me this night was not going to be allowed to pee until I got her home.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Please, please, I have to pee!&quot;
    Jenny said, struggling to her feet.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No, not yet.&quot; I said, standing
    as well and nudging the poor girl back into her seat.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Please, I&#146;m busting!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The poor girl had drunk two and a half
    pints of beer and was wriggling about on her chair as we sat in a corner of the bar. Our
    table was right beside the toilets, which didn&#146;t help her as every five minutes some
    guy or girl would wander through for a wee. It was Friday night and the place was heaving,
    but there was no way I was going to allow her to pee if I could help it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Another drink?&quot; I offered.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She hesitated before saying, &quot;Can I go
    pee after it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I nodded but just said, &quot;We&#146;ll
    see.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She had severe doubt in her eyes but
    agreed, resuming her frantic squirming. As I stood at the bar I gazed back to view her in
    all her wonderful early stages of desperation. She was wearing a lovely long skirt with a
    slit up the side and I guessed she had on a gorgeous pair of tight white panties that must
    have been stretched tight across her aching stomach. Her legs crossed tightly as the
    drinks arrived. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Her eyes stared wide as I placed two pints
    on the table, &quot;You&#146;ve got to be kidding!&quot; she said, &quot;I&#146;m
    practically pissing myself already, I&#146;ll never manage that!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Drink it up then you can go.&quot; I
    said with a smug smile on my face.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She sipped slowly. The evening was getting
    late. Her eyes wandering more and more frequently towards the door to the Ladies. With
    half her drink gone she again pleaded with me to let her go, but I shook my head, telling
    her to finish her drink first. She downed it quickly after that but I took my time with my
    own. Her eyes were pleading with me to let her go pee, which was not surprising given that
    three and a half pints of beer were now filling her rapidly beyond her capacity. Her hands
    were rested across her lap and occasionally her knuckles went white as she pressed firmly
    downwards.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I have to pee so badly, please let
    Jenny go pee.&quot; She said smiling, trying to get on my good side. A group of four girls
    wandered past us into the Ladies. That sight saw Jenny crossing her legs even tighter and
    I could only wonder at the size of her bulging bladder. I could hardly wait to get her
    home and view it in all its glory, but she was now begging me to let her go. She had
    wanted to hold on for me but her bladder was just becoming too full,</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Please,&quot; she sobbed,
    &quot;I&#146;m in agony! I&#146;ve just got to go!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Again I refused, telling her she just HAD
    to wait until we got home. She was leaning forward more and more as it began to take every
    ounce of her strength to hold it back.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I&#146;m bursting, I&#146;m
    bursting!&quot; She said under her breath, again urging me to let her go.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I&#146;ll tell you what we&#146;ll
    do,&quot; I said, &quot;We&#146;ll leave now and you&#146;ll be back home before you know
    it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Oh God thank you! I just don&#146;t
    think I can wait much longer!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I downed my drink in one and we stood to
    leave. She managed not to hold herself as we walked out onto the street and I put my arm
    around her waist. I could just feel the tight agonising bulge of her bladder as my hand
    strayed across the front of her skirt. She looked up, smiling weakly. Clearly she was in
    agony but I wasn&#146;t about to let this go to waste. We walked to the taxi rank, which
    fortunately wasn&#146;t too busy. There were still three or four people in front of us and
    we had to wait about five minutes before a free taxi arrived. We both scrambled into the
    back and Jenny crossed her legs at once, grateful to at least be seated once more. I asked
    her if she was okay and she replied &quot;NO! I need a piss!&quot; Load enough for the
    driver to hear. He looked in his mirror to see her starting to fidget wildly on the back
    seat, her hands clinging onto the fabric as she struggled to avoid wetting herself.
    &quot;You&#146;d better hold on to it lady,&quot; the driver said, &quot;I don&#146;t want
    my seat messed up.&quot; </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;But I need to go so bad, you&#146;d
    better hurry!&quot; She begged.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The driver sped along and screeched to a
    halt ten minutes later at the end of our road.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Please hurry!&quot; Jenny screamed as
    I took my time paying the driver after we were out. She was hopping up and down and
    frantically pressing both hands now between her legs. I finished paying and guided her
    towards our house. Inside she was almost doubled up, leaning over the sofa.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Can Jenny go pee now!?&quot; She
    asked.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No, not just yet.&quot; I replied.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She gasped as a powerful urge spread right
    through her, &quot;Jenny can&#146;t wait, she must go for a wee!&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Let me see you first.&quot; I said.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She unzipped her skirt and let it fall to
    the ground. Her tiny white panties were stretched across her bursting bladder. I eased
    them down and gazed in absolute wonder at her abdomen, so rigid and firm and full to
    bursting with pee that was by now absolutely frantic to get out. How she was holding I
    just don&#146;t know. My hands drifted behind her quivering buttocks as I knelt in front
    of her and started kissing her stomach. She gasped with a mixture of delight and utter
    desperation as I let my tongue drift to her wet pussy and slip inside, close to her pee
    hole. Somehow she managed to squeeze her muscles shut but the effort this was now taking
    was now clear to see.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I took her hand and walked her into the
    kitchen, &quot;Hold it for me a bit longer.&quot; I said.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">She nodded, now just as excited as I was.
    Without the constraints of her clothes she seemed a little better, although the swelling
    of her bladder was clearly evident. I poured out a pint of water and asked her to drink it
    down. She did so, meaning she had now drunk 4 and a half pints in the last five hours and
    hadn&#146;t peed once. I hadn&#146;t peed either and was now busting to go myself. But how
    could I? I had to hold.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Wearing just a simple top and bursting to
    go Jenny sat on the sofa shivering. I threw her her bath robe which she grateful placed
    around her shoulders. She sat hunched up with her legs hugging up to her chest. I switched
    on the telly and we started watching a documentary. Half way through Jenny suddenly
    announced that she couldn&#146;t wait any longer. She had been pressing a hand between her
    legs and constantly rocking back and forth. Now even that movement was not enough to
    contain the huge amount she was holding. She stood in front of me, bending forwards and
    frantically pressing a hand even more firmly against her crotch.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I have to pee now.&quot; She
    announced quite calmly.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I shook my head. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot; I&#146;ll pee anyway if you
    don&#146;t let me, I can&#146;t wait any longer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I could see she was fuller than ever and
    was really struggling to hold on. I looked at my watch, it was nearly twenty minutes to
    midnight, &quot;Do what ever it takes to wait until midnight.&quot; I said. &quot;You can
    go then.&quot; She glanced at a wall clock and the look on her face told me she probably
    wouldn&#146;t be able to wait that long, but she nodded. I retrieved her knickers and
    asked her to put them back on so I could tell if she&#146;d done some. She cursed me as
    she struggled back into them, hopping up and down, unable to stand or sit still even for a
    moment now. For the next five minutes she paced up and down the living room, one of her
    hands never leaving her crotch. I asked her to come to where I was sat and reached a hand
    between her legs, pushing the palm up against her. She tensed but just remained in
    control. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Another five minutes past with her leaning
    against the sofa, twisting and squirming her legs together. She was now very close to
    bursting point. Soon nothing she could do would stop the inevitable loss of control of her
    exhausted sphincter muscles. She begged me to let her go before it was too late, but I
    refused. Her middle two fingers were thrusting in and out of her pussy. She tried
    crouching, then actually squatting, which she said felt really good but made her even
    closer to losing it. She tried resting on all fours, which worked for a while but she soon
    became desperate again.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">I had her remove her knickers and robe
    again for the final ten minutes. Even I was amazed at the sight of her bladder. She looked
    several months pregnant. Still unable to let go of her crotch for more than a few seconds
    she continued to pace up and down, all the time begging me to let her go. She was
    constantly wailing about how desperate she was. Her frantic pacing became more and more
    intense, until she was virtually trotting from one end of the room to the other, still
    thrusting those fingers against her aching pee hole. A massive urge suddenly hit her and
    she stood stock still for a few seconds, willing herself not to let go. The urge passed
    but soon returned with even greater intensity. Her bladder was starting to fail. She still
    had eight minutes before she could pee. She wandered into the hall, both hands now locked
    against herself, holding her back from the brink. I let her stagger upstairs to where the
    bathroom was but she still had six minutes to wait.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Every few seconds she was screaming at me
    to tell her how long she had to wait. Each time I told her she cringed and almost doubled
    up. Her bladder was so close to breaking point, it simply couldn&#146;t contain another
    ounce of pee or it would burst! Jenny couldn&#146;t take her eyes off the loo. She had to
    go so bad. Every muscle in her body was squealing at her to let it go. She was within
    seconds of letting go a flood. With four minutes left she just went crazy, sprinting along
    the landing, jumping up and down. Her hands left her crotch and clung onto her bum cheeks.
    She was losing the battle, even will power was not working now. Her movements suddenly
    slowed. Sensing it was reaching a point where she simply couldn&#146;t wait any longer, I
    reached in the bathroom for an empty waste paper bin, just as she leaned forward, legs
    tightly crossed. A period of total silence ended with a load gasp as her bladder finally
    forced her to let out a tiny jet of wee. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">As it started to drip I placed the bin in
    front of her and she managed to move over it just in time and squat, spreading her legs
    wide and letting go a blast of wee that literally rattled the bin. After the first surge
    she grunted as she forced out more and more, staying there for a full five minutes before
    she declared she couldn&#146;t pee another drop. Ecstatic now we ran laughing down stairs
    to measure it. We both knew it had to be a new record for her and she wasn&#146;t
    disappointed. 1.6 litres, a truly memorable hold.</font></p>
