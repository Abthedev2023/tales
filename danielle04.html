    Desperation and Accidental Wetting.</strong></font></span><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is a true story that happened to a woman named Jenny.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny needed to pee. It wasn't an extremely urgent need (at least not yet, anyway), but it
    was enough to cause her some discomfort. She had been bagging groceries nonstop for the
    past 2 1/2 hours, and it wasn't even an hour and fifteen minutes into her shift that she
    began to feel that familiar sensation of painful pressure weighing down on her urethra.
    Jenny was an attractive Caucasian girl, with a slim body and shoulder-length dark blonde
    hair. But now her cute face was beginning to show the strain caused by the increasing
    heaviness in her bladder.<br>
    <br>
    A customer noticed her furrowed brow and pursed lips and asked her if there was anything
    wrong.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, it's nothing,&quot; she replied. &quot;I just need to use the bathroom, that's
    all.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The customer chuckled and said, &quot;Well, I hope you get to go soon.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny said that she also hoped so and put the last of her groceries in the cart.<br>
    <br>
    After he left, she turned her attention to the next customer, a rather dull, unintelligent
    middle-aged woman who couldn't decide whether she wanted paper or plastic. Jenny started
    to assist the dim bulb customer when she spotted her manager walking toward the checkout
    area. Jenny knew from the past two weeks that she was working at the supermarket that he
    was a bit of a loser, but she thought it wouldn't hurt to ask him if she could go relieve
    herself real quick. She politely asked the customer to wait a few moments and walked over
    to her manager to ask if she could go pee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Could you please take over bagging for me so I can go to the bathroom?&quot; she
    inquired. &quot;It'll only take a couple of minutes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look, I have some work to do in the office,&quot; the manager snapped back in an
    irritated tone of voice. &quot;You'll just have to wait.&quot; Then he quickly walked
    away.<br>
    <br>
    Exasperated, Jenny went back to what she was doing. Geez, I was just asking, she thought.
    But then she figured she could hold it until her half-hour break, which was an hour and
    twenty minutes away.<br>
    <br>
    As the minutes passed, Jenny continued the repetitive task of bagging groceries and trying
    to ignore her need to urinate, which was becoming more urgent. The fact that the store was
    getting busier didn't help either. I knew I shouldn't have drunk all that tea before
    coming into work today, Jenny thought regretfully.<br>
    <br>
    When her break time finally came, Jenny was now very desperate to pee. But her manager was
    nowhere to be found and she couldn't leave the checkout area until he gave her permission.
    A minute later, he finally showed up again. Jenny hurried over to him and said it was time
    for her break.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, you don't get a break,&quot; he exclaimed unexpectedly. &quot;The store's busy
    and we need more people up front.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Please let me go,&quot; Jenny pleaded. &quot;I have to go pee really, really
    bad!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, that's tough. You're just going to have to hold it until the end of your
    shift. You're not a little kid. Now get back to work.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As he walked away, Jenny stood there flabbergasted. She couldn't believe that her break
    was denied. She walked slowly back to her work area, trying not to pay attention her
    bursting bladder.<br>
    <br>
    It was illegal for them not let to her take a half-hour break, of course. But Jenny didn't
    want to make a scene. Besides, she needed this job. The college scholarship she earned
    paid for the courses, but not books or transportation, and she was barely making ends meet
    as it is.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny started bagging for the latest customer. Her shift wouldn't end for another three
    hours, and she knew that she probably wouldn't be able to hold it until then.<br>
    <br>
    Nearly two hours passed as Jenny bagged more groceries and struggled to keep from losing
    control of her bladder. More customers started to notice the strained expression on her
    face and asked her about it. She said it was nothing and went filling up their carts.
    Jenny could not remember a time when she ever had to pee this badly! She was so desperate
    that she kept shifting foot to foot, and she desired to press her hands into her crotch,
    just to temporarily relieve the pressure caused by her full bladder- to ease her tortured
    sphincter muscles just a little. The worst part came when crouching down to get paper bags
    from underneath the counter.<br>
    <br>
    Oooooh, I can't hold it much longer, Jenny thought. Just then, a customer moved up the
    checkout counter with a 24-pack of beer, the largest item she had seen all day. Jenny
    stared at the 24-pack with a mixture of fear and despair. But she knew she couldn't refuse
    service to a customer just because she was about to pee in her pants. After all, she
    needed this job. Grimacing, she tried to lift the beer case off the counter, but it
    instantly caused too much strain on her body and bladder, and suddenly she couldn't hold
    it any longer for a few seconds. &quot;Oh no!&quot; Jenny thought in horror, dropping the
    24-pack. Urine poured into the crotch of her panties from her emptying bladder and
    cascaded down her legs, soaking the front of her tan khakis from the crotch down to knee
    level. Jenny looked down in shock and humiliation and saw it was barely seeable. The other
    customers and her co-workers could not clearly see that she was wetting herself.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny suddenly became angry herself and jumped up off the bench but she mostly felt
    embarrassed even though it was not showing. She now needed to go badly. Only 15 minutes
    until she finally got her break.<br>
    <br>
    It was getting even busier within the next 5 minutes. She was now so desperate. She was
    just about to leave but she needed the job for college so there was no way she could just
    go. Now, after 9 minutes later, 1 minute till her break, a customer came up and asked if
    she could quickly wait for a minute because she needed to get something quick. She said
    yes but she was holding her crotch hard now. After 2 minutes the customer came back and so
    she had helped her out. Her boss came and said that she could take her break after all of
    the customers are gone from the line. That meant 3 more people to go. That was good. After
    5 more minutes, she had gotten her break. She desperately searched for a bathroom. She
    could not find one. She felt a few drops go down her pants so she hurriedly looked for
    bushes outside. She saw bushes and so she went there. I followed her and saw that she
    knelt down and started to pee. She peed for 2 minutes and 20 seconds but she had heard
    someone (me) and so she pulled her shorts up but she was still letting it go so she peed a
    little in her pants. I now noticed that you could see it on her pants. She started to cry
    now. She saw that there was no one at her vision so she pulled it them and finished peeing
    for another 15 seconds. She then stood up and started to walk home and change to some
    other clothes. I followed her home and she was in front of her house and so she just peed
    all over her pants now and it just flowed for another 25 seconds. I guess that she had
    really needed to pee. She went inside for 2 minutes and came out in dry clothes but then,
    she must have needed to go again because she tried rushing towards her restroom but she
    let more go over her pants. Jenny now stared in shock so she went back in the house and
    changed. She walked out and then she started to walk normally off to her job. <span><font
