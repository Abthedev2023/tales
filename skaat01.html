    Episode 1 - Dawn of the Wet<o:p></o:p></strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Laurie was a college student, a respectable girl with shoulder-length blonde hair and a
    perfect attendance record. Her friend Kitty was something else: she was a bit of a rebel
    who would rather be attending a party than a lecture. The girls were close friends since
    childhood, however, and were now roommates in their sorority. The night after the last of
    their final exams there was a big party at a friendly sorority house, and both girls were
    going. Under the light of a full moon Laurie drove her jeep through the fields on campus;
    the sorority houses were quite far from each other, so it was quite a drive. Kitty was
    fidgeting in the passenger's seat, and Laurie knew from experience what that meant. Kitty
    was wearing a tank top and a tight pair of jeans, she had dark blonde dread locks tied
    together in a ponytail. Her belly was bare under the tank top, and Laurie could clearly
    see Kitty's bloated bladder.<o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial"
    color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Laurie,&quot;
    Kitty then said sternly, &quot;I have to go to the bathroom!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Not again,&quot; Laurie sighed
    deeply, &quot;why didn't you go before we left?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I didn't have to go
    then,&quot; Kitty whined, &quot;but I really have to go now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie saw Kirsten grabbing her
    crotch with both hands and looking at her desperately.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Could you please pull
    over?&quot; Kitty begged her, &quot;I can't hold it any longer!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;This is so typical,&quot;
    Laurie said, &quot;remember what happened last year during the school trip?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty remembered very well: she
    didn't go to the bathroom before leaving and wet her pants on the bus. She had to live
    with the embarrassment of peeing in her pants at age 17.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, you wet your pants in
    gym class three years ago!&quot; Kitty retorted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Only because you kept on
    tickling me,&quot; Laurie answered, &quot;we were supposed to be wrestling, but you
    tickled me although I begged you to let me go to the toilet!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, I'm going to pee in my
    pants right now if you don't pull over!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty yelled, and Laurie knew she
    was serious.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You'll just have to hold on
    until we get there,&quot; Laurie smiled at her cruelly; then, the jeep suddenly hit a bump
    on the road. Because of the shock, Kitty felt a trickle landing in her cotton panties; she
    felt the warm fluid run all the way into her butt crack. With all her power she pushed her
    fingers into her crotch to keep the rest back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Shit!&quot; she screamed,
    &quot;Laurie, pull over NOW or I'm going to pee all over your car!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie hit the brakes and pulled
    over near the biology building. Kitty jumped out and ran into the field in front of the
    building, but she didn't see any bushes near to crouch behind. She bent over, grabbed her
    crotch even harder with both hands and crossed her legs; then she looked at Laurie and
    whimpered desperately.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Why don't you just go behind
    the car?&quot; Laurie suggested.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No way, anyone passing can see
    me,&quot; Kitty was hopping around from one foot to the other, &quot;there's a light on in
    the building, there must be someone there. Can't we go inside?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm not going to ask the
    biology department if you can use their bathroom,&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie laughed, &quot;you'll have to
    pee out here or hold it until we get there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty looked at the building, then
    at Laurie, then at the building again. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was trembling all over; then,
    she felt a tremble in her bladder and for a second time, a warm, wet feeling spreading
    throughout her crotch. This was bigger than the last; she felt the stream running past her
    clitoris, into her butt crack again and soaking into her panties and jeans. A single drop
    fell through her pants and onto the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please, Laurie!&quot; Kitty
    begged, &quot;I mean it, I really can't wait any longer!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, all right,&quot; Laurie
    said, rolling her eyes and grabbing the keys to her jeep as she stepped out. Kitty ran
    towards the building, keeping her thighs close together, and her hands pressing deep into
    her crotch. Neither of the girls noticed the ground trembling where Kitty's drop of pee
    had landed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty pushed the door open with her
    shoulder, she couldn't even bear the thought of letting go of her wet pants - even when
    not keeping her pee in, it covered the wet spot that was already there. The hall of the
    biology building was deserted; the fluorescent lights were burning and humming, but other
    than that all was silent. Kitty still danced around a bit to prevent herself from wetting
    her pants totally, but she did notice a bunch of signs, showing where everything was
    positioned in the large building. One of the signs said &quot;bathrooms&quot; and pointed
    towards a long corridor. Laurie also walked into the hall, and saw a wet patch on the back
    of Kitty's pants. She had to restrain herself from laughing at her, and decided not to
    mention it to keep her friend from shame.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come on!&quot; Kitty said as
    she ran towards the corridor. Laurie stopped her however, and said &quot;shouldn't we ask
    someone if it's alright first?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty danced around where she stood
    and broke free from Laurie's weaker grip.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can't wait,&quot; Kitty
    whined, &quot;I have to go NOW!!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty ran into the corridor. Laurie
    thought it was a ridiculous sight, her friend running with her thighs pressed together,
    but by the wet patch on her pants she could clearly see that her need was great. Kitty
    kept on running until she saw a door with a female sign on it, a similar door with a male
    sign was next to it. Quickly she opened the door and ducked inside, almost losing complete
    bladder control from sheer relief. When she entered the bathroom, she felt another trickle
    escape out of disappointment. All of the stalls were destroyed, probably by vandals; the
    toilets were ripped out of the floor and the doors were hanging from their hinges. Water
    was spurting out of the wall and the floor everywhere, flooding the entire room. This
    certainly didn't help Kitty's ordeal, so she stepped out quickly and pinched her crotch
    once more. She closed her eyes and bit her lips to keep her pee from flooding out onto the
    floor; she heard soft footsteps approaching her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The toilets are
    destroyed,&quot; she cried softly, &quot;I'm not going to make it now, Laurie. I'm going
    to wet my pants.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was no answer. Carefully, she
    opened her eyes and looked beside her; she didn't see Laurie standing. A large shadow was
    hovering over her, she couldn't make it out clearly, but she saw a huge, monstrous,
    rodent-like form with red, gleaming eyes looking at her. Kitty screamed loudly and fell to
    her knees; she was still holding on to her crotch, but she felt a strong, warm stream
    flowing throughout her pants. It ran down both her legs and a large puddle formed between
    her legs on the floor. The creature seemed to bend over towards Kitty, but she was able to
    roll out of the way. Getting back on her feet, Kitty ran into the corridor again, towards
    the exit. She was still peeing as she ran, mostly out of fear although it did seem
    inevitable at any rate. Small, yellow puddles appeared on the black and white tiles as she
    ran out the door, into the hall, and back to the outside. There, she regained control over
    her bladder; she had already wet her pants, but that was no reason to let everything run
    freely off course. Kitty looked around and saw Laurie sitting in her jeep, waiting for her
    friend to come out. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty started running toward the
    jeep, but Laurie saw the wet spot in her crotch clearly. Her friend smelled of urine, and
    Laurie was sure she wasn't coming anywhere near her jeep.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Did you wet yourself
    again?&quot; Laurie laughed out loud, &quot;I guess you're going to come to the party like
    that then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;There's something in
    there,&quot; Kitty said as she brushed away her tears with her arm.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;And I guess it made you wet
    your pants?&quot; Laurie laughed even harder, &quot;You're not coming into my car like
    that, you know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty started panicking again. She
    had wet herself, but she still needed a bathroom really badly. She couldn't get herself to
    hold her crotch, now it was dripping with pee, and she had to spread her legs to keep them
    from sticking together. It felt cold now, and wet, but that thing in there was still after
    her. Laurie and Kitty looked up in fear as they heard a maddening growl from the hallway
    of the biology building; a large form was indeed standing there as it ripped the front
    door out of its hinges and threw it outside. Kitty jumped into the jeep and landed in the
    seat with a soggy sound; Laurie neglected the urine smell for now and started her car. The
    creature ran after them for a second after the jeep drove off, but it clearly couldn't
    keep up and disappeared on the horizon. When she was sure it was out of sight, Laurie
    pulled the jeep over once more.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What was that?&quot; she asked
    in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't know,&quot; Kitty
    started crying again; she was shifting in her wet seat, &quot;but I still have to
    pee!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Will you shut up about
    peeing,&quot; Laurie snapped as she loosened her safety belt. Kitty noticed that she
    wasn't sitting too comfortably, either.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let's just find another
    bathroom,&quot; Kitty suggested, &quot;the sorority house is too far off, and I won't be
    able to hold it until we get there, but maybe there's someplace else nearer by.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Good,&quot; answered Laurie;
    she pushed her thighs together for a moment, then sighed and pressed her foot onto the gas
    pedal again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">TO BE CONTINUED.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
