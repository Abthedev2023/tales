    Accidental &amp; Deliberate Wetting.</strong></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><br>
    </font><br><br>A recent forum post asked 
      about early experiences so perhaps I should tell about mine. I never had 
      any problems when I was younger; as far as I can remember I never wet my 
      knickers or my bed until my late teens, although I can recall several 
      incidents involving friends. In most cases they wet themselves laughing, 
      probably the main cause of accidents for teenage girls. In my case I was a 
      poised and confident student of 19 when I first experienced the thrill and 
      embarassment of weeing myself, though as two of my friends also soaked 
      their pants at the same time we had a good laugh about it.
      <br><br>The three of us had gone to an open air pop concert in the country on a 
      gloriously hot summer day. Of course, there were the usual chemical 
      toilets, which we risked using during the morning but which were 
      increasingly foul later in the day. Anway, we found ourselves a pleasant 
      place on the hillside with a good view of the stage but away from the main 
      crush. We danced a lot and drank large bottles of Pepsi or water as we 
      rested, sprawled out on the grass. By mid-afternoon we all needed to wee 
      but as girls do, kept putting it off. As we sat down to rest after a 
      particularly wild dance I noticed Carrie holding herself between her legs 
      as we lay panting for breath on the grass. She saw me looking, announcing 
      to us all that she had almost peed her knickers during the last dance and 
      was so desperate she wasn't sure she could reach the loo even if there 
      wasn't a queue. There was, as we could see from where we sat. We would 
      also have to pick up all our gear and push through a crowd to get 
      there.<br><br>Rosie admitted that she too badly needed to wee as did I, suddenly 
      becoming nervous about what might happen if I didn't go off to the toilets 
      very soon. I belatedly realised that I was in some danger of a rather 
      embarassing accident, but then grown women didn't wet themselves, did 
      they? Apparently they did, and sometimes deliberately as well. Carrie 
      looked at the queues then looked at us, saying, "I'll never make it 
      through that lot. I'll pee myself before I'm halfway there anyway so I'm 
      just going to sit here and do it in my knickers - its warm and they'll 
      soon dry!
      <br><br>I looked at Rosie who was picking up her things ready 
      to head for the toilets. We both looked at Carrie who had pulled her skirt 
      back and was sitting with her knees up and legs slightly apart. We could 
      clearly see her blue knickers which suddenly darkened as she just sat 
      there and wet them, a stream of wee running down the slope in front of 
      her. We were speechless but the sight of Carrie just letting go made us 
      both more aware of our own need. "God, that feels better,"she announced. " 
      Well come on, surely you two have wet your knickers before - it's easier 
      than the trek to those smelly old porta-loos. 
      <br><br>"I have not,"I growled, "I haven't wet myself as far back as I can 
      remember and I don't intend to do it now,"though with an increasing 
      suspicion that I was in a situation where it might just happen. Rosie just 
      grinned and said it wouldn't be her first accident and at least this time 
      she was wearing a skirt. Apparently she had wet herself some weeks earlier 
      when walking home rather drunk from a friends party. The need to pee had 
      just crept up on her and before she realised what was happening she had 
      soaked her pants and jeans, much to the amusement of her mother who had 
      been waiting up for her.<br><br>We sat there giggling like kids at the story. Even 
      Rosie was laughing about it till she stopped suddenly and clasped herself 
      between her legs. "Don't make me laugh anymore or I'll wet myself again." 
      she spluttered. To which Carrie responded that if it was that bad it would 
      be running down her legs long before she reached a toilet, reminding her 
      of the long queues. Rosie looked across to the nearest lines and then 
      looked back at Carrie. "You're right" she grinned with a resigned sigh, 
      "If I'm going to wet my pants I might as well do it here as there. At 
      least it will only be you two who know about it, and Carrie's pants are 
      wet anyway!"
      <br><br>With that she sat down on the slope, skirt pulled clear as Carrie had 
      done, legs drawn up and apart with her knickers clearly visible. She sat 
      there for a while, staring across to the stage. "I can't do it," she 
      moaned, "I'm bursting but I can't let go." Carrie looked at her. "That 
      happens to me sometimes. Just relax and think about sitting on the loo, 
      then just let it flow." I began to wonder at that point just how often 
      Carrie wet herself rather than use a toilet.<br><br>Rosie sat there, eyes closed. Then she stiffened and I watched 
      fascinated as a jet of pee spurted through her pants. She relaxed a moment 
      and then the flood came. A torrent soaked her pink cotton knickers and 
      trickled down the slope away from her before soaking into the ground. She 
      seemed to wee for ages and I watched, intrigued by the sight of my friend 
      sitting there wetting her knickers. "Oh God that feels better," murmered 
      Rosie, "What a relief. Oh its hot and it tickles. Its running up my bum!" 
      The flow died away and she pulled some tissues from her bag and mopped her 
      thighs. "You're right, " she said, "I would never have hung on till I 
      reached the loo. That's so much better, even if I have got a wet bum."<br><br>They both looked at me. Despite the pain in my bladder I backed off 
      doing what the others had done - I was just too embarrassed. Before we 
      could talk any longer a new group began to play. My bursting bladder had 
      me dancing anyway so I jumped up, hoping the movement would help me hold 
      it. Well it did for a while. As the music died away I suddenly felt a warm 
      spreading wetness between my legs. Instinctively I tried to stem the leak 
      but to no avail. The trickle down my thighs turned into a flood. All I 
      could do was stand there looking foolish, wetting my knickers like a silly 
      child. In my surprise at what was happening I cried out, "Oh, Oh, Oh! I've 
      wet myself. I'm weeing in my knickers. Oooh! Its running down my legs!" I 
      seemed to wee for ages, standing there legs spread, staring in embarrassed 
      surprise at the growing puddle around my feet and the wet streaks down my 
      legs. A warm damp feeling tickled my bottom as the wetness spread through 
      my cotton pants.<br><br>"Well, if you want everybody to know what you've done that's the way to 
      do it," laughed Carrie, stopping to put her arm around me as I started to 
      cry. "Don't worry," she said, "Its happened to all of us but it's much 
      better to quietly wet your pants before you lose control. That way no-one 
      need know you've had a little acccident." Embarrassed as I was I had to 
      admit that I been rather silly. After drying my legs with tissues and a 
      spare tee-shirt I began to feel better. I didn't even find the feel of my 
      wet knickers uncomfortable, in fact as I danced the feeling of the wet 
      material rubbing my clit made me feel quite randy, though at the time I 
      thought it was more to do with the music!<br><br>An hour or so later we needed to wee again and as we were all still 
      damp simply sat on the grass and wet our pants again. This time I found 
      the feelings of naughtiness at doing something so forbidden quite exciting 
      and paid more attention to the exquisite feeling of hot pee washing over 
      my crotch. I began to appreciate why Carrie seemed to find pleasure in 
      wetting herself. It was late when we left and before walking the couple of 
      miles home wet ourselves again. I enjoyed that walk.<br><br>My parents were away so I had the house to myself for the weekend. I 
      needed to wee again by the time I reached home, but instead of using the 
      loo thought "so what, I haven't used a loo most of the day." Standing in 
      the back garden I just let go again, loving the feeling as the hot wee 
      filled by knickers and ran down my legs. As the flow died away I rubbed 
      myself to a wonderful orgasm. As a new source of pleasure this was 
      exquisite.<br><br>Since then I often wet my knickers when the opportunities for such 
      private pleasures present themselves. I have managed to avoid public 
      accidents, though there have been times when I have wet myself on a 
      country walk or on a beach. I've only wet the bed once and don't think I 
      could hide this from Mum if it happened too often (I do my own washing so 
      she has never come across wet underwear). It happened one morning when I 
      again had the house to myself. I woke up desperate but was too lazy to get 
      up and go to the loo, so lay there, rubbing myself to help me hold it. 
      Then I came, and promply lost control and wet my pants as I lay there. 
      No-one knew about this accident except me, but one day Mum is going to 
      notice the large stain on my matress. I think I will tell her I was drunk 
      and had an accident when I didn't wake up in time.<br><br>
