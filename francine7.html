      <P class="storyteller">Forced March</P>
      <P class="small"> This story is laid in the years of World War II, when 
        female soldiers first began to enter the American Army in numbers. It 
        involves a training march through open country, with a small detachment 
        of women surrounded by male soldiers, and their tough female sergeant, 
        determined to show her charges as both rugged and proper. No real sex, 
        just a bit of &quot;hold it&quot; and some wetting in a military situation, 
        and on a somewhat mass basis. F, w/s<BR>
      </P>
      <P> The time was the mid-1940's; the war in both Europe and the Far East 
        was in full swing. America's military was growing daily, and women in 
        uniform, once a novelty, were in increasing numbers.<BR>
        <BR>
        Sergeant Dorothy Showalter had the army in her blood. The daughter of 
        a career army officer, she had grown up on military posts, familiar with 
        the military life and ritual, and strangely drawn to it. As a girl, the 
        only women she had seen in uniform were a few army nurses, and she had 
        barely hoped to one day proudly wear her own uniform. In 1942, with the 
        formation of the Women's Army Corps, her chance had come, and she had 
        signed up when the first call for recruits went out. Now, at 41, with 
        a husband in Europe awaiting the long-expected invasion of the continent, 
        and a brother with the marines in the Far East, she found herself wearing 
        the stripes of a First Sergeant, leading WAC recruits through their early 
        training. <BR>
        <BR>
        She had charge of a platoon of some forty women, most of them much younger 
        than herself, many fresh from high school or college, and eager for the 
        adventure of military service. &quot;Dot&quot;, as she was known to her 
        friends, had the task of turning these raw recruits into something resembling 
        soldiers. Later they would go to army technical schools where they would 
        learn to become truck drivers, mechanics, radio operators, or one of many 
        other military specialities; but, to Dot, they were raw material to be 
        molded, however harshly, into the tough elements of which victorious armies 
        are made. <BR>
        <BR>
        She answered her summons to the CO's office with military crispness, but 
        was soon put at ease by her commander, Capt. Mary McCaulley. &quot;Dot&quot;, 
        she began, in friendly manner, &quot;for tomorrow, your platoon has been 
        chosen to participate in a training exercise which will involve a 24 hour 
        forced march through the west country, about 32 miles total. Two battalions 
        of male soldiers will comprise the bulk of the exercise, but we have been 
        asked to assign a platoon of women to participate. As you know, women 
        are being sent into the overseas theatres in increasing numbers, and are 
        going to be close to combat situations. Frankly, General Early is interested 
        in how women will stand up to rigorous field conditions, and it is up 
        to us to give him a good demonstration. I have selected your platoon because 
        I know you can show him what a group of tough women can do. I will be 
        going along, but I'm to be assigned to the colonel's staff, so the troops 
        will be in your care. The march will begin at 0300 hours, and I will show 
        you the route on the map. Your group will be trucked to the starting point, 
        so have them lined up, with packs and field equipment, including a day's 
        rations, at 0230. There will be a few short rest breaks, and one longer 
        break at the Signal Corps station, but they won't do much sleeping. The 
        trucks will pick them up at 0330 the following morning for return to the 
        barracks.&quot;:<BR>
        <BR>
        The Captain went over the map and logistical arrangements. Dot absorbed 
        her orders attentively. Mary gave her one final admonition. &quot;Dot, 
        you know there will be hundreds of men and a lot of officers looking at 
        your platoon. They will be looking for any signs of fragility, or what 
        they will consider 'female weakness'. I expect that they will see none. 
        Got it?&quot; &quot;Got it. Affirmative,&quot; Dot responded. She shook 
        hands with her CO, then departed with a crisp salute.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot assembled her charges for their orders. Having them fall out beside 
        their barracks, she gave them a quick inspection, making certain that 
        no one was found without a flaw. There were thirty eight women, with four 
        more on sick call. Dot gave them no rest. &quot;All right, you creeps!&quot; 
        she began, &quot;We've pounded soldiering into your heads. You've been 
        read the Articles of War and you'd better know your General Orders! Tonight 
        you'll do some pounding with your feet! You're to fall out here at 0200 
        - that's right, 0200! Fatigues, packs, full canteens, and you'll be issued 
        field rations. What you need you carry, and what you take out, you bring 
        back! You're going to march thirty odd miles over rough country, so don't 
        tell me your feet hurt! Field shoes and extra socks! And if any of you 
        have monthly problems, carry your supplies with you, and bring back the 
        stuff you take off - I'd better never hear that some male soldier had 
        to pick up some smelly used pad that a female left on the landscape! I'm 
        supposed to make soldiers out of the crummy stuff they send here, so you're 
        going to act like soldiers? Got it?&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Dot barked her instructions in a twenty minute tirade to the assembled 
        recruits, took no questions, and finally dismissed them to the mess hall, 
        afterwards to clean the barracks, police their area, and soundly sleep 
        until awakened at one thirty in the morning. <BR>
        <BR>
        The following day, Dot assembled her charges at two A.M., led them through 
        twenty minutes of calisthenics, inspected their dress and equipment, berated 
        them thoroughly over every offense she could imagine they might have committed, 
        and marched them to the waiting trucks. At 2:30, three truckloads of tired, 
        sleepy women were being hauled to the assembly point. Each wore the regulation 
        army olive drab fatigues, pants and jacket, with heavy field shoes over 
        thick socks. Each carried her pack, canteen, and side arms. <BR>
        <BR>
        Three A.M. They climbed out of the trucks at the assembly point. Capt. 
        McCaulley met them, gave them a quick word of encouragement, then introduced 
        Dot to an officer at her side. &quot;Major Ervin, this is Sgt. Dorothy 
        Showalter. She will be in charge of the WAC platoon.&quot; Turning to 
        Dot, she added, &quot;I will be with the command post - Major Ervin will 
        be your commander for the march. I know you will give him a good show!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Major Ervin was, at the moment, less than impressed. He quickly informed 
        Dot of his expectations. &quot;Sgt. Showalter, this is a military training 
        exercise. Your group is just like the rest of us. You have been assigned 
        a central position in the line of march - you won't have to lead, so you 
        won't go astray; and if you leave any stragglers, the troops in the rear 
        will herd them back to you. I expect no more - and no less - of your women 
        than of any other soldiers. You are expected to keep up, and no concessions. 
        You get the same rest stops as the men. I want to warn you that you have 
        about forty women here among nine hundred men. I expect discipline. I 
        want no unnecessary fraternization. We're not here for fun. I expect your 
        women to hold their own, and I don't expect them to distract the men or 
        look for any special favors. Particularly, I expect them to stay in uniform 
        and make no displays of themselves. Is that clear?&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Indeed it was, and Dot repeated the orders, with appropriate emphasis 
        to her 38 recruits. Loudly she commanded them to fall in, and they took 
        up their positions in the pre-dawn darkness.<BR>
        <BR>
        The column began its movement across the countryside after an appropriate 
        waiting period. At first they marched briskly in cadence, but gradually 
        the formality subsided and they slogged along, but at a quick pace. The 
        stride was set by the men, and some of the women were pushed to keep up. 
        At the first sign of a whimper, Dot passed by the ranks of her troops. 
        &quot;You are soldiers - soldiers, do you hear me? Miserable, poor, inept, 
        and uncouth excuses for soldiers, but still soldiers! Hear me! I don't 
        want to hear a cry, a whimper, a complaint! I don't want to hear that 
        anyone's nose runs or that your butt itches! I don't want to hear your 
        feet hurt, or that anything else hurts! Every one of you is going to act 
        like you can do this as well as any man in this army; and the first one 
        I see with tears, or crying or complaining, will spend the next few weeks 
        of her army life scrubbing latrines!&quot; Dot had learned well the manner 
        of the drill sergeant. Not a sign of female weakness would escape her 
        eye, or go unpunished.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dawn broke, and with rising of the sun, the summer heat would soon become 
        apparent. A little after six, word was passed down the column to allow 
        a ten minute break. Dot ordered her group to fall out, and they began 
        to break ranks and wearily take seats on the ground. Men were in front 
        of them, and behind, in fact, all around. Dot allowed a few words of greeting, 
        but beyond that, she saw that the male soldiers kept their distance. She 
        did notice many of the men slipping back a short distance from the column, 
        obviously to relieve themselves, and several did so with their backs to 
        the women. Dot wished they were a bit more modest about this, but the 
        country was largely barren, and there was little cover. She started wondering 
        about her own troops. After all, they had been up now five hours, and 
        for at least four hours she knew none of them had had a bathroom break. 
        Her attention was drawn to this situation when one of her soldiers cautiously 
        approached her, asking &quot;Sergeant, can we go the bathroom -I mean, 
        some of us would like to pee!&quot; Dot really couldn't figure out how 
        to handle this - there was no place of privacy, men were all over. She 
        had been warned to keep her women &quot;in uniform&quot; and not to distract 
        male soldiers or ask for special treatment. If she asked the men nearby 
        to turn their backs, or move away, she would be accused of demanding special 
        treatment - after all, no one had asked the women to look away when men 
        were answering nature's call nearby. However, if she just let the women 
        drop their pants and squat, surely someone would complain of the women's 
        immodesty or find that in relieving themselves, they were a distraction 
        to the men. Dot's job right now was to prove women were tough. She would. 
        She would also hope for a bit more seclusion at the next rest stop.<BR>
        <BR>
        Abruptly, Dot gave her answer. &quot;No. Right now you wait. I'll tell 
        you when you can pee. Until then you hold it!&quot; Dot hardly had to 
        repeat the answer. Most heard it, for she made it loud and clear. Women 
        were tough. They would hold it. To herself, Dot hoped it wouldn't be for 
        too long.<BR>
        <BR>
        The march resumed. An hour or so later, they were allowed a short break 
        for breakfast - such as it was, from their field rations. It was getting 
        warmer, Dot noted. Also, there was no shelter, yet. The &quot;no pee&quot; 
        edict remained in force. Although several women asked if they could somehow 
        relieve themselves, there was no open rebellion, no vocal complaint. For 
        the moment, they were compliant.<BR>
        <BR>
        A new problem was arising. Dot noticed the women were reluctant to drink; 
        many were not opening their canteens, and it was getting warm. Soon it 
        would be hot. They were marching, sweating, and they would be getting 
        dehydrated. One thing she didn't need was a bunch of women suffering from 
        heat exhaustion, maybe even passing out. This was not going to demonstrate 
        that women were tough soldiers. She gave an order to her group, &quot;All 
        of you! You've got to get water in yourselves, or the heat's going to 
        affect you! I want every one of you to drain at least half of her canteen 
        right now! You can refill from the water bags on the truck later! Drink 
        up! NOW!&quot; Her command was in earnest. The women complied, looking 
        nervously at each other. They couldn't pee, and now they were being ordered 
        to fill up on water. Things were going to get worse.<BR>
        <BR>
        The day went on, the column still moving at a fast pace. The women were 
        tiring, and many were getting quite uncomfortable. Dot knew she was receiving 
        urgent signals from her own bladder demanding relief, and she hadn't found 
        the solution. About half past ten, the women had gone over eight hours 
        without urinating, she reflected. Something would have to give, and something 
        did. She gaped at Ellen, marching in an outside position in the third 
        rank. A dark spot was spreading in her fatigues, and her pants were dripping. 
        Dot grabbed her, demanding &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, 
        Sergeant,&quot; she replied, &quot;I just couldn't hold it any longer 
        - I had too!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;You're a soldier&quot; snarled Dot to the almost tearful girl. &quot;Stop 
        it! Now! I told you you can pee when you get permission - not before!&quot; 
        Quickly Dot pushed her to an inside position, moving another woman to 
        the outside rank. Then she took the girl's canteen from her, and inspected 
        it. It was full - she hadn't been drinking much. &quot;Drink it - all 
        of it - NOW!&quot; Dot noisily commanded, so all the others could hear 
        her. The girl continued to march in place, while chugging down the contents 
        of her canteen. When at length she emptied it, Dot handed her own canteen 
        to the girl, and commanded, &quot;Drink this, too - all of it!&quot; The 
        girl, fearful, finished what was left in Dot's canteen. Now, with a stomach 
        sloshing with water, she looked tearfully at her sergeant. Dot called 
        to the whole group, &quot;You see what she got? Fortunately for her, with 
        the hot sun, her pants will dry out in a while. Now she's got enough water 
        in her to give her a bigger problem than she had before! When I say hold 
        it, I mean hold it! You'll be told when you can relieve yourselves, and 
        don't try doing it until then!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Another twenty minutes and Dot spotted her second casualty. Marge, in 
        the rear rank, was trying to conceal what was obviously a leak into her 
        pants. While she appeared not to lose as much as Ellen, she was clearly 
        out of control. Again Dot scolded her severely, moved her position to 
        a less conspicuous location in an inside rank, and commanded her to fill 
        herself from her canteen.<BR>
        <BR>
        The truck with water bags was not far away, and Dot saw that all of the 
        canteens were refilled. Again, at a rest stop, she ordered the women to 
        drink deeply of the water. She had to keep them from being dried out and 
        subject to heat stroke, even if they got painful bladder problems. Her 
        own bladder was beginning to hurt, having passed to stage of just discomfort. 
        She knew she couldn't bully the women into holding themselves much longer, 
        and she was trying to think of an acceptable solution, when another emergency 
        became apparent.<BR>
        <BR>
        She got a quick look at Julie, as she moved up slightly from her rest 
        stop. On her pants could be seen a very noticeable red spot. Dot called 
        her to account, and in her most brusque manner, demanded an explanation. 
        Julie tried to answer softly, greatly embarrassed. &quot; It's my period 
        - I need to change my pad, but there's been no chance - I didn't mean 
        to make such a mess, but - what can I do?&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Dot quickly had three other women stand around Julie. She was ordered 
        to loosen her fatigue pants just enough to allow her to reach inside and 
        try to do the changes. Much embarrassed, but with the help of two others, 
        she managed a change. The red spot was still much in evidence.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot looked at her in apparent disgust. &quot;You'd better wash those pants 
        out right now! The pants will dry, but you need to wash out that color. 
        Now!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        The girl look incredulous. &quot;Wash it? With what? I 've nothing to 
        use!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;You've got a load of it to use! Pee! Now! In the pants! And don't 
        tell me you don't have a full bladder - everyone here does!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        The command was incredible to the others, but Julie complied. Her pants 
        were saturated. The red spot didn't disappear, but it faded considerably 
        as it washed all over the remainder of her fatigues. A nearby voice called, 
        &quot;Can I do it, too, please?&quot; The plea was met with a thundering 
        &quot;No&quot; from Dot.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot knew she was in deep trouble, and she was on the verge of just ordering 
        the women to wet their pants, realizing this would surely make them he 
        laughing stock of the army. As the march resumed, Dot could see the signal 
        station ahead - the intended site of a longer rest stop. A plan was emerging, 
        if she could just force the women to wait a bit longer. She knew what 
        trouble they were in, for her own bladder was stretched to almost unbearable 
        limits. It felt as though the bottom of her stomach had a huge swollen 
        spot with an increasingly severe ache. She secretly admired her women 
        for being able to torture themselves this far.<BR>
        <BR>
        Another three quarters of an hour saw them arrive the signal station. 
        It wasn't much, but it served as a landmark. It had several antennas, 
        a small wooden building for communications equipment, and behind it a 
        small barracks building for the small detachment of soldiers assigned 
        here, with a wooden building housing a latrine next to it.<BR>
        <BR>
        The several hundred men stayed well away from the station, since they 
        had no real business there and it served only as a landmark for the march 
        route. As she had noticed before, the men found other places to relieve 
        themselves, in fact virtually anywhere along the route of the column. 
        &quot;If only to be a man&quot;, Dot thought, realizing what problems 
        women had with what men considered a simple bodily function, easily done 
        almost anywhere outside. &quot;Well, easily done if only in male company&quot;, 
        she thought.<BR>
        <BR>
        It was arranged that the troops be given a one hour rest break here. The 
        column broke up, as units decomposed into bodies of men sitting and standing 
        along the route of march. Dot was not so easy on her group. &quot;At ease!&quot; 
        she commanded, &quot;For the moment!&quot;, and left her thirty eight 
        women standing in agonized discomfort as she walked a few steps to the 
        station. Quickly she approached a sergeant apparently on duty, and loudly 
        inquired, &quot;Have you got a really dirty, smelly latrine here that 
        needs a good GI treatment? Because I've got a bunch of lazy scrubwomen 
        who think the army is place for fun and games, and need a good dose of 
        toilet cleaning while the others rest up! Can you help me?&quot; The sergeant 
        smiled. Not before had he the offer of a female crew to house clean anything 
        in his area. He gestured toward the wooden building housing the small 
        latrine. &quot;Feel free! They'll find scrub tools inside the door!&quot; 
        He stood back to watch the fun.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot returned to her platoon, standing with grimaced faces and squirming 
        bodies. She drew herself up in front of the fatigue-uniformed women, knowing 
        quite well that under each of 38 sets of fatigue pants was an extremely 
        full female bladder. <BR>
        <BR>
        After addressing her charges with appropriate expletives, loud enough 
        to be heard by many of the men in the area, and rich enough in invective 
        to be worthy of the proverbial drunken sailor, she instructed them, &quot;while 
        the rest of the soldiers here get a short rest, you bunch of no-good lazies 
        will have the privilege of scrubbing out the local latrine, as a gesture 
        of thanks to the local inhabitants who have been blessed with the dubious 
        pleasure of your company! You will proceed to that building, one rank 
        at a time, and take turns cleaning the place until the floor shines and 
        everything therein is bright enough to reflect your disgusting faces! 
        MOVE!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        The first rank of women headed for the building, picking up buckets, scrub 
        brushes, and cleaning rags they found inside the door. <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;MOVE&quot; loudly commanded Dot, as the first group entered the 
        building and set to work. The little building was small, just one room, 
        in which were two toilets, two urinals, two sinks, and a shower stall 
        with two shower heads and a drain in the floor. There were no partitions 
        - everything was in the open, true military style. Loud with authority 
        she directed the handing out of cleaning items as the first rank went 
        to work. Then, in a low voice, to the women as they entered, she added 
        &quot;and while you're scrubbing the place you've got a private latrine 
        to accommodate your personal needs, and I suggest you be about it!&quot; 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        She returned to the remaining ranks outside, and began loudly reciting 
        their numerous flaws and offenses. As she stepped aside momentarily, she 
        encountered the station's sergeant. &quot;Sarge,&quot; he began, &quot;I 
        don't know that I'm yet in favor of women in the army, but I hand it to 
        you - you know how to treat recruits! Where did you learn?&quot; &quot;Growing 
        up as an army brat!&quot; Dot returned with a scowl, trying to cover up 
        her own internal torture as her bladder expanded to its very limits.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot entered the latrine, hoping she could soon withdraw the first rank 
        and send in the second. The scene that greeted her was almost insane with 
        chaos; both toilets were occupied, with a second woman standing by each 
        in obvious distress. Four women were squatting in the shower stall, pouring 
        out forceful steams near the drain, while two stood at the urinals, male 
        style, their pants and underclothes off, as they tried to maneuver themselves 
        in position to use the fixtures. Three more were on hands and knees, scrubbing 
        the floor and pipes. The soldier positioned on the first toilet was noisily 
        crooning, &quot;Oh, paradise is when you've had to pee for hours and finally 
        they let you!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Shaking her head, Dot quickly moved the women to cleaning work as they 
        relieved themselves, then sent several out to bring in the next rank.<BR>
        <BR>
        The procedure continued, amid loud clanging of buckets, dumping of water, 
        and much evidence of activity as women went back and forth through the 
        door. At one point, Dot unfastened her own pants as she went into the 
        shower, squatted with the others while she emptied her bladder onto the 
        floor, now awash with female urine gradually running down the drain.<BR>
        <BR>
        Half an hour after they had started, the women were relieved and the latrine 
        was gleaming from the work of many hands. Approvingly, Dot inspected the 
        results and recalled her charges to the positions in the column of march. 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Loudly, she again scolded them for their poor performance, but the smiles 
        on their faces belied her sincerity. The women, refreshed and much relieved, 
        were ready to resume.<BR>
        <BR>
        The afternoon was extremely hot, and Dot knew she wouldn't easily find 
        another place like to station to relieve her group. Nonetheless, she insisted 
        that they partake heavily of water to fend off heat stroke. They trudged 
        along, their spirits lifted with confidence in their leader. <BR>
        <BR>
        Dot was hoping they could last until dark before another bathroom break. 
        The women were sweating profusely in the heat and with their continued 
        exertion. In mid-afternoon they experienced a moment of triumph when they 
        saw a male soldier fall out of ranks and collapse in exhaustion. At least 
        it wasn't a woman who was the first to fall!<BR>
        <BR>
        As dusk settled, the women had been six hours without a bathroom break, 
        longer, Dot noted, than most of the men around them who were seen to be 
        taking opportunities to relieve themselves whenever there was a rest stop. 
        Dot was feeling fullness in her own bladder, but nothing like what she 
        had forced herself to endure in the morning. <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Sarge, when can we pee again?&quot; one of her women asked her, 
        now showing obvious anxiety. Rather than bully them with her rough mannerisms, 
        she answered quietly, &quot;when it's dark enough - it won't be much longer!&quot; 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        Dark fell, but there were no rest stops soon. In the darkness, with cooler 
        temperatures, soldiers were expected to last longer, and the pace was 
        kept up. Around eight o 'clock word was passed to break for half an hour, 
        and allow the troops to break out rations. No lights, it was noted, could 
        be allowed. They were to stay in blacked-out condition, no smoking, no 
        fires, no lights. There was little moon, and it was difficult to see beyond 
        one's closest neighbor.<BR>
        <BR>
        As they halted, Dot loudly commanded them to fall out, but remain within 
        touch of each other. Then, much more quietly, she instructed them, &quot;The 
        area within our perimeter is your latrine - use it, and keep yourselves 
        dry. The holding time is over, for now.&quot; Grateful soldiers did as 
        instructed.<BR>
        <BR>
        The night was long, and they were exhausted. They were allowed a two hour 
        break, to sleep if they could, before resuming the final stage at about 
        one in the morning. At long last, they were able to meet the trucks at 
        their terminal point, and the tired and dirty soldiers climbed into the 
        trucks for the ride back to their barracks.<BR>
        <BR>
        Dot had not seen Capt. McCaulley since the march began. She began to wonder 
        what had become of her. Finally she spotted her Captain as the trucks 
        unloaded. Mary McCaulley summoned her for a report. At some length, Dot 
        recited the events of the day. The captain seemed pleased. &quot;I don't 
        think there should be any real complaints about our women soldiers. I'll 
        be interested in hearing what the male officers have to say, later.&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        About to depart, Dot hesitated. &quot;Captain, could I ask you one very 
        personal question?&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; Mary replied.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Well, Captain, you were with the headquarters group - all men, except 
        yourself, as I understand.&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Right, Dot. Your old Captain and a dozen or so men.&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Just for my future guidance, Captain, would you tell me - how did 
        you, er, handle the bathroom problem?&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Mary laughed. &quot;Dot, when I first saw the men starting to step off 
        to the side to, well, we all knew it was to pee, they would often excuse 
        themselves with some remark, like 'I need to take a leak' and I tried 
        to ignore them. Usually they turned their backs to me, and they weren't 
        trying to offend me. None of them made any suggestion as to what I should 
        do; and I kept hoping there might be a tree or somewhere sheltered to 
        which I could excuse myself; but, as you know, the country was pretty 
        bare. By the time I saw men taking their relief the second or third time, 
        my bladder was hurting so bad that I didn't care who was watching or what 
        they thought. So when one Major stepped aside after giving some remark 
        to excuse himself, I simply said to him, 'I need to, too - I'll join you' 
        and I did. I just squatted down beside him when he got ready, and I think 
        I shot out the biggest stream I've ever done in my life. He just stared 
        at me, but I didn't care!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Weren't you considered a 'distraction' to the men?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;No one said I was! I'm supposed to be an officer and a lady - but 
        just then it was a lot more of being an officer and a woman! I may not 
        have been a lady, but I felt a lot better!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Captain, you will be glad to know that the members of my platoon 
        were soldiers AND ladies!&quot; Dot responded, reflecting to herself that 
        they would probably have much preferred to have acted as the Captain had.<BR>
