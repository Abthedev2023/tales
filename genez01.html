    <br>
    Robert, a friend of mine, related this story to me a few weeks ago over a drink, when he
    was already a little drunk, and I thought you might like to hear it, so I made sure to
    press him for the details. He had been looking for a job over summer, to get some cash
    ready for his second year at college, and the opportunity came in the form of the Daley
    family. The Daleys were from England and had been friends of Robert&#146;s parents since
    they moved in about five years ago, and so Robert was very familiar with their daughter
    Susanne. Susanne was fourteen, almost fifteen, and was growing up to be a very attractive
    young woman. I was introduced to her myself at around the same time, and she was quite
    striking in that she was so different to most girls of that age. I remember when I was
    fourteen all the girls around me were dressed up like whores, in the most revealing
    clothes they could find and with their hair died blond and their faces covered in makeup,
    but that&#146;s not how Susanne was at all. Her face was the gentle sort, with beautiful
    eyes like a deer and always a little smile on her face. Her brown hair only went down to
    chin length and hung down with a little natural flick forwards at the bottom, and a fringe
    that nearly reached her eyes but didn&#146;t quite. Her body was coming on beautifully
    when I met her, you know, she wasn&#146;t going to be the model type, not too sexy like
    the girls on TV, but perfect anyway with all the right curves in all the right places, and
    the right weight as well, she wasn&#146;t stupidly skinny but she certainly wasn&#146;t
    even approaching overweight. Her skin was pale and smooth-looking. In fact this was a girl
    you wanted to spend time with because she looked great and she was great to talk to as
    well, with her innocent little voice.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, Susanne wasn&#146;t the reason why Robert had been invited over that day. In fact
    it was her younger sister, whose name I can&#146;t really remember, I think it was Beckie.
    She was only six, and as Susie wasn&#146;t sixteen yet her parents thought it would be
    better to call Robert over to babysit for the weekend while they went out to visit
    relatives in Canada. They didn&#146;t want to take the kids, because it had been so long
    since they&#146;d been able to have a holiday together and with Robert available it seemed
    like a good idea to leave them with him.<br>
    <br>
    So Robert arrived just as the Daleys were leaving, they were getting a bit anxious in case
    they missed their flight, but they got out on time in the end. Robert had brought a crate
    of beers for himself (he knew the Daleys wouldn&#146;t mind), and so that Beckie would
    take to him he&#146;d brought a big box full of small bottles of cherryade, her favourite
    drink.<br>
    <br>
    When he got in he said hi to Susanne first. He said she had just finished getting dressed
    when he arrived, as it was about eight in the morning on a Saturday, so he met her as she
    came down the stairs. She was wearing a T-shirt with a large flower on the front (although
    he told me the T-shirt was getting a bit old so was a little tight, showing off her round
    breasts quite nicely, they were the sort that stayed in place and didn&#146;t sink down),
    and a grey ruffled skirt that came down to just above her knees. She was looking really
    nice, he told me, because he&#146;s always had a secret thing for Susie. He never acted on
    it of course, she was just a little too young still, but it was obvious to anyone who met
    her that she probably had a lot of admirers, and I can say that from personal experience.<br>
    <br>
    Robert found Beckie bouncing up and down in the front room, with a video on. It was
    something like Barney, I think he said, and all the kids on the TV were jumping as well,
    it was part of a song. When Beckie saw the Cherryade she went straight for it, and Susie
    asked if she could have some as well. Robert told her to help herself, as there was a lot
    of it there (he&#146;d got it cheap from a friend who worked at a department store), and
    then went upstairs to use the bathroom, as he hadn&#146;t been yet that day.<br>
    <br>
    There was something up with the bathroom door as he opened it, it made a sort of heavy
    clicking sound. He had been to the Daleys&#146; loads of times and it hadn&#146;t done
    that before. Still, he ignored it and carried on. When he&#146;d relieved himself he went
    to leave, but the door seemed to be jammed. He pulled it as hard as he could and it
    eventually burst open onto his toe. He left the room, swearing quietly, and again he had
    to really pull as hard as he could to close the door behind him, even harder than
    he&#146;d had to to open it.<br>
    <br>
    When he got downstairs he was surprised to find that Susie had actually drank more of the
    cherryade than Beckie had, Beckie was still on her first bottle but Susie had finished one
    and was half-way through the next. She waved to him brightly as he came and sat down.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Are you staying over tonight?&#146; she asked. Robert nodded.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Yeah, your parents won&#146;t be back &#145;till Sunday night.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Cool. Does that mean we can watch whatever we want on TV?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert laughed. He thought he might as well be nice, give her a treat just for tonight.
    &#145;Sure, why not. It&#146;s only one night. Not her though.&#146; He pointed to Beckie,
    who was now completely engrossed in Barney, with the now empty bottle of cherryade still
    angled as if she was drinking from it.<br>
    <br>
    Robert and Susie sat for a while watching Beckie&#146;s videos. They were quite funny.
    Susie got through another five bottles of cherryade before Robert noticed and told her to
    save some for later. Susie giggled and put down the bottle, then came and sat on the sofa
    next to Robert. Holding down her skirt so it didn&#146;t ride up her legs, Susie changed
    position so her legs were folded over to the side of her and sat like that for a few
    moments. Then she suddenly went to stand up.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Nope, it&#146;s no good,&#146; she said with a laugh, &#145;I have to use the
    bathroom.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Seeya,&#146; Robert said, watching her as she went out of the room and up the
    stairs. He liked the way she said &quot;bathroom&quot; even though she was British. He
    remembered how he always picked up phrases from his friends when he was her age. Her
    footsteps stopped for about half a minute, then started back down the stairs again. She
    sat down next to Robert again.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;That was quick,&#146; said Robert, &#145;did you go?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;No,&#146; Susie replied, &#145;the door&#146;s jammed.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Did you try pulling it real hard? That&#146;s how I got it to open.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I tried, but it didn&#146;t budge. Never mind.&#146; Susie swung her legs onto the
    sofa under her again. Robert returned his attention to the TV. Right now Beckie was
    watching a cartoon about a bear having a party. After a few minutes, Susie turned to
    Robert and said, &#145;Do you think you could try the bathroom door? You&#146;re probably
    stronger than me.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert noticed that as well as having her legs under her, Susie had them squeezed slightly
    together. He grinned. &#145;Sure, I managed it last time.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I have to go too,&#146; Beckie said, turning off the TV. &#145;Can I go too?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Sure you can,&#146; said Robert, and turned off the video tape for her. He started
    up the stairs and Beckie followed, running, with Susie behind her. Robert reached the
    bathroom door, gripped the handle, and pushed it as hard as he could. The clicking sound
    came again, quieter this time, and it sounded as if he had dislodged something in the
    hinges. The door then opened, and Susie started walking to the bathroom.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I have to go,&#146; Beckie complained, &#145;can I go first Susie?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie looked down at her with a slightly annoyed expression. &#145;Sure, of course you can
    Beckie,&#146; she said, &#145;go ahead.&#146; Beckie ran into the bathroom and, with
    Robert&#146;s help, shut the door. Susie leant against the wall watching the bathroom
    door. Robert noticed her bob down slightly, for just a moment, with one knee bent a
    little. He wondered how much she really needed to go. It seemed like she would&#146;ve
    liked to have said no to Beckie, but was too polite to do so in front of him.<br>
    <br>
    Robert turned away from the door and made sounds with his cheeks, trying not to hear the
    sound of Beckie peeing into the toilet, and Susie did the same. They heard the water
    running as Beckie washed her hands (the Daleys always made sure she did that), and heard
    the toilet flushing, and then the handle on the outside turned as Beckie tried to get out.
    But, of course, she wasn&#146;t strong enough.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m stuck!&#146; she shouted through the door. Laughing, Robert went up to the
    door and gave it a push.<br>
    <br>
    It didn&#146;t open. He pushed it again and still, it didn&#146;t move. &#145;Dammit,
    it&#146;s really stuck,&#146; he said, pushing against the door with his shoulder. He
    glanced over at Susie, who looked a little worried.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;You mean it&#146;s - she&#146;s trapped in there?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;No, no, we&#146;ll get her out.&#146; Robert kept pushing on the door, but it
    wouldn&#146;t budge. Susie let out an audible sigh and pushed herself away from the wall,
    frowning as she walked over to the other side of the stairs and rested her chest on the
    railing there, looking down to the front room. Her right leg left the ground for a few
    moments.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Are you opening the door?&#146; Beckie called from inside the bathroom.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m trying, honey,&#146; Robert called back, and, taking a slight run-up,
    crashed against the door. Nothing happened.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Isn&#146;t there another way of opening it?&#146; Susie asked suddenly, and stood
    next to Robert, her back perfectly straight and her hands gripped together behind her
    back.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I don&#146;t know,&#146; Robert said. He felt sorry for Susie, she obviously needed
    to use the bathroom, and he knew she would feel helpless if she could only watch him
    struggle against the door. &#145;Do you wanna try?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Yeah,&#146; Susie said, and began to wrestle with the doorhandle herself. She
    pushed, and pushed again, and then with a sudden effort that made Robert jump she bashed
    the whole side of her body against the door, but it still didn&#146;t open. She sighed
    angrily with a pained expression on her face and stamped one foot (in annoyance or
    desperation, Robert wondered), then returned to the balcony railing.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Help!&#146; Beckie&#146;s voice cried, muffled through the door, &#145;I&#146;m
    stuck here forever!&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;No you&#146;re not,&#146; Robert called, struggling against the door again,
    &#145;we&#146;re gonna get you out, you&#146;ll be okay.&#146; He hoped Beckie
    wouldn&#146;t do anything silly like turn on one of the faucets while she was in there.
    The last thing he needed was a flood on top of a trapped child, but if he told her not to
    do it it might give her the idea where before she hadn&#146;t thought of it. But, at least
    he had all of today and Sunday to figure out a way of getting her free if brute force
    didn&#146;t work on the door. But then there was Susie. She was too well raised to go in
    the garden, and too shy to go and ask the houses next door if she could use theirs, and he
    knew the house didn&#146;t have a toilet downstairs either. He looked around at Susie, who
    had her eyes closed now and was standing a distance away from the railing, bent over and
    holding it with her hands, putting all her weight on the railing. She looked quite
    desperate, she must have been already needing to go quite badly when they were watching
    the videos downstairs. &#145;It&#146;s true though,&#146; Robert thought to himself,
    &#145;when you&#146;re at home you don&#146;t always go to the bathroom until you really
    need to, because it&#146;s always there when you want it, you don&#146;t have to think
    ahead I guess.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie let go of the railing and put both her hands firmly down my her sides, pressing onto
    her legs. She gave two little jumps and bit her lip. For a moment, Robert felt a twinge of
    excitement watching her. He wasn&#146;t sure whether it was sexual excitement or the
    wondering <em>would she make it</em>? He thought it might be fun to make it a little more
    interesting.<br>
    <br>
    He walked over to Susie who, knowing Robert was watching her now, stood still.
    &#145;I&#146;m a little worried about Beckie in there,&#146; he said. &#145;If she messes
    with the faucets there could be water running everywhere.&#146; In his mind he gave a
    broad grin as he saw Susie&#146;s expression waver, she was obviously uncomfortable with
    the thought of running water.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Perhaps you should tell her not to,&#146; Susie suggested.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;ll do that,&#146; Robert smiled, &#145;for all we know she could be in there
    for hours.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    As he turned away he heard a rustling sound - Susie was fidgeting again.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Hey Beckie,&#146; he called, &#145;make sure you don&#146;t play with the faucets
    okay?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Why?&#146; came Beckie&#146;s response, just as Robert had expected, and immediately
    the sound of flowing water could be heard. Susie looked around with a frown on her face,
    trying not to catch Robert&#146;s eye. She bit her lip.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Hey Beckie, I said <em>don&#146;t</em>!&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;It&#146;s OK,&#146; Beckie called back, &#145;nothing bad happened. See?&#146; The
    sound got louder - she had turned on another faucet. Robert turned to face Susie again,
    and was just quick enough to see her hand whip back to her side from between her legs.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Don&#146;t worry, she won&#146;t be in any danger. I&#146;ll make her stop.&#146; He
    turned back to the door, trying not to laugh. &#145;Beckie, you gotta stop that.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Why?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Just do it, Beckie.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    The water stopped. &#145;Sorry,&#146; said Beckie.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;It&#146;s okay, just don&#146;t do it again.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Get me out!&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m trying. I&#146;m gonna go look for something to help open to door,
    I&#146;ll be right back okay?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Okay.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Be good.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Okay.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert walked over to Susie again so Beckie wouldn&#146;t hear. &#145;Susie, does your dad
    have any tools?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I think so,&#146; Susie said, her voice a whisper.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Where does he keep &#145;em?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m not sure, in the garage, I think,&#146; she said, a troubled look on her
    face as she struggled to stand still.<br>
    <br>
    Robert started down the stairs and asked Susie to come with him so she could show him
    where she thought they were. In actual fact it was because he didn&#146;t want to miss any
    of the show. The two of them went through the house, but Robert soon noticed that Susie
    had stopped. He looked around behind him and there was Susie, standing perfectly still and
    upright, her bottom lip firmly clamped under her teeth, with an anxious fear in her eyes.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;What&#146;s the matter, Susie?&#146; he said, genuinely concerned. Had he gone too
    far?<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Nothing,&#146; she said softly, &#145;I&#146;m just looking for something.&#146; She
    began to look around her, pretending there genuinely was something she&#146;d lost. Robert
    smiled. If she was going to play this game he wasn&#146;t going to stop her. He carried on
    walking, and she called to him that she&#146;d follow along in a moment. He thought it was
    a shame to miss whatever she was doing that he shouldn&#146;t see, but there was something
    he needed to do.<br>
    <br>
    He hurried into the garage and immediately spotted Mr Daley&#146;s tools. They were all
    hanging up neatly on the wall under a window. He grabbed as many as he could and shoved
    them behind a large wardrobe, which was presumably there in storage. Susie came in,
    walking slowly, and gave a weak smile.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Did you find it?&#146; Robert asked.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Uh... yeah...&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Good.&#146; Robert didn&#146;t ask her what it was she&#146;d been looking for. He
    didn&#146;t want to be completely inhumane. After all, the bathroom door really was stuck,
    that wasn&#146;t his doing. &#145;Where are these tools?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie&#146;s eyes went straight to the wall, and her face fell when she saw there were no
    tools there apart from a hammer and a few screws and nails in tubs. &#145;I don&#146;t
    know...&#146; she said. Suddenly she seemed distressed and pointed wildly to the other end
    of the room. &#145;I think there are some over there,&#146; she whimpered. Robert could
    see she really needed to go and wanted him to look away. He continued to look at her for a
    few moments before he followed her direction.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Over here?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Yeah...&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert stood there for a while facing the direction she had pointed, but he wasn&#146;t
    looking there, he was secretly watching the window, in which he could see a clear
    reflection of Susanne. She had her hand rammed tightly between her legs and was bent over
    at the waist with her teeth clenched. She was losing it. Robert could see from the way she
    was dancing her legs that she didn&#146;t have long left before she would wet her panties,
    so it was probably time to ease off and actually try to help her. Without waiting for her
    to get herself under control, Robert turned around, deliberately slowly so she would have
    time to let go of herself.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I can&#146;t see any,&#146; he said.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I must&#146;ve been mistaken,&#146; Susie said quickly. Robert began to look around
    the room now, pretending not to know where the tools were. &#145;No, I can&#146;t find
    any,&#146; he lied, &#145;let&#146;s go back upstairs and see what we can do. We&#146;ve
    been pushing it for so long the door&#146;s probably weakened a little now.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Okay, but let&#146;s <em>hurry</em>,&#146; Susie blurted, without thinking.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Why?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m... worried about Beckie,&#146; she replied, jigging up and down slightly.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Let&#146;s go then,&#146; Robert said, and added, &#145;you lead the way.&#146;
    Susie simply nodded, and set off, walking slowly. Robert chose not to comment on this. He
    noticed, as she walked up the stairs, that all the time she was keeping the tops of her
    pretty legs pressed together as she walked.<br>
    <br>
    When they got to the top of the stairs, Robert went straight for the bathroom door, and
    began to push on it again, putting all the weight he could on the handle.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly from somewhere around the hinges there came the same deep clunk, the sound he had
    heard last time which meant the door was no longer jammed, but this time it was very
    quiet. He stopped putting all his weight on the door and pushed it very slightly. It
    moved. The door was no longer stuck. He looked over to Susie - she hadn&#146;t noticed.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Are you getting any closer to opening the door?&#146; she pleaded, looking up at him
    with her big eyes and twisting a strand of her hair around one finger.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Uh... no, sorry Susie, she&#146;ll be stuck a little longer until we can think of
    something else to try.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Oh...&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert wondered whether he should have said that. Was he taking this too far? Perhaps he
    was, but this was all very entertaining. He could see her legs squeezing together again
    and again, and occasionally she jogged her weight from one foot to the other and back. He
    wondered whether she thought he could see this, and decided she probably didn&#146;t.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;What should I do?&#146; Beckie called.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Nothing honey, you sit still and don&#146;t do anything, okay?&#146; Robert
    wasn&#146;t going to take any chances and let the infant open the door herself.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Okay!&#146; Beckie sounded even a little excited by this adventure now.<br>
    <br>
    Robert looked back to Susie. She had her eyes tightly shut now, with the hair bitten
    tightly in her mouth as well as her bottom lip, with one fist clenched against her side.
    The other hand had grabbed the front part of her skirt from behind, and was pulling it
    back so it pushed up against her. She pulled tighter, and Robert turned away when he
    noticed it was so tight he could see where the material was pressing around the folds of
    her labia.<br>
    <br>
    He coughed, and in the corner of his eye saw Susie let go of the skirt. &#145;Susie, we
    need to think of something. Let&#146;s sit down on the stairs and <em>think</em>.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;OK,&#146; she breathed, obviously trying with all her might not to lose control. As
    Robert passed her he saw her dance on the spot, from foot to foot, her cheeks flushed red.
    She followed and sat down heavily on the stairs, but she continually changed position.
    Robert sat there with a frown on his face, pretending to be thinking, but instead he was
    having a lot of fun looking back at the desperate Susie every now and then, and watching
    her try to remain still.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly she stood up, and marched quickly around the corner into one of the upstairs
    rooms where she thought Robert couldn&#146;t see her. She forgot about the large mirror
    that sat on the opposite wall. Robert tried not to laugh out loud with delight as he
    watched her hand grab straight between her legs again, and her legs working furiously up
    and down. She was bent double now, rocking back and forth with her back. Her eyes were
    closed, her lip was still bitten, and occasional short breaths seemed to be escaping from
    her mouth, he could hear every one. He watched her fingers as they pressed with all their
    might, continually changing position and pushing up harder than before. Susie was
    desperate, and he&#146;d never seen anyone so desperate before. She wasn&#146;t just
    desperate in the way that people think of when they say they&#146;re desperate for the
    toilet, she was desperate in the classic sense - she had to get to the toilet right now,
    or she wouldn&#146;t make it. If she didn&#146;t get into that bathroom at exactly that
    moment, Robert knew, it would be too late.<br>
    <br>
    It was time to have some fun.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;ve thought of something, Susie,&#146; he said, standing up, watching her try
    to regain control and slowly revert to a standing position that was somewhere near
    ordinary. Then he walked to the bathroom door, pretending not to have noticed the mirror,
    as Susie emerged. &#145;I&#146;m gonna tap on different parts of the door, and see if I
    can hear any differences. That way I might be able to tell which part is stuck.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Okay.&#146; Susie&#146;s voice was almost a whimper now.<br>
    <br>
    Robert put his ear to the door, facing Susie, and tapped on different parts of it. He knew
    full well this wouldn&#146;t do anything but Susie was in such a state that she
    wouldn&#146;t notice it. Susie was looking around and continually squirming slightly.<br>
    <br>
    Susie&#146;s face suddenly went red, and she turned to walk into the nearest room. Robert
    knew she wanted to hold herself again, but he quickly stopped her.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;No Susie, don&#146;t move. I want to be able to hear this.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    She stopped, facing him, aghast. Her legs were pressed together and the look on her face
    was of genuine terror. She bobbed up and down and rubbed her thighs together, and even
    grabbed herself for a brief moment when she thought he wasn&#146;t looking.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Stand still Susie,&#146; Robert said, &#145;you have to be absolutely still or
    we&#146;ll never get this door open.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie stood still. There was nothing else she could do. Her feet were slightly apart and
    she tried to squeeze her thighs together but they weren&#146;t close enough. Her hands
    were down by her sides - she was simply standing there, facing Robert. She bit her lip,
    then released it, then bit it again. She lifted one foot...<br>
    <br>
    &#145;No, really, you have to be totally still.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    She let it fall again. Silent moments passed. Robert tapped on the door again, almost
    forgetting to.<br>
    <br>
    Susie made a small noise, and Robert saw that she was crying.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;What&#146;s the matter Susie?&#146; he said, his voice full of genuine compassion,
    but inwardly loving it.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m w-worried ab-about Beckie,&#146; Susie said, and managed to stop crying.<br>
    <br>
    And then, as Robert watched her, the thing he had been waiting for happened, and it was
    perfect.<br>
    <br>
    A tiny droplet, almost clear with a slight golden tint, appeared from under her skirt,
    running down the inside of Susie&#146;s right leg, leaving a wet trail. A second drop
    followed, and soon it was a continuous, though small, trickle. There was a gentle
    pattering sound as a few drops hit the carpet between her feet. The first squirt. The
    trickle became a stream, and was joined by a second, this time down her other leg.<br>
    <br>
    Never in his life had Robert been so utterly transfixed by anything. He could do nothing
    but stare at Susie as she stood before him, her eyes filled with tears and her hand
    pressed against her mouth, and the dark spots on the carpet between her feet. More drops
    joined the first.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly her legs were awash as the streams became a flow, running together, twisting
    around her legs, splashing down onto the carpet. She grabbed herself again but it just
    dribbled down between her fingers. Then the tide slowed to a stop.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m sorry,&#146; Susie whispered, &#145;I&#146;m sorry.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;D... Don&#146;t be sorry,&#146; Robert said, his voice just as quiet. He felt guilty
    now as he saw the tear run down her cheek. &#145;It wasn&#146;t your fault.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;It&#146;s worse than ever... There&#146;s so much more... I can&#146;t hold it...
    Open the door...&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Robert nodded and turned. He was going to open the door this time. But as he pushed, the
    clunk could be heard again, and the door was jammed fast. He couldn&#146;t open it no
    matter how hard he tried, and there was poor Susie standing helpless with her hand wedged
    between her legs and half-squatting down on the floor to try and keep control.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I can&#146;t,&#146; he whispered, &#145;I can&#146;t open it!&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I can&#146;t hold it! I need a wee!&#146; At least she had kept that British
    expression.<br>
    <br>
    Robert could think of nothing else to do. She had to get outside to the garden, but she
    couldn&#146;t get there by herself. He rushed forwards and scooped Susie up in his arms,
    her legs dangling over his left arm and her head on his shoulder, her arms around his
    neck. He lifted her up and started down the stairs, as fast as he could. He strode quickly
    through the house, and as he neared the back door he felt a warmth hit his arm and dribble
    down it. Susie gasped as another squirt escaped.<br>
    <br>
    The door was locked. Robert turned and strode back into the house, finding the keys hung
    up on the wall as usual. He grabbed them and went back to the door, feeling another spurt
    hit his arm.<br>
    <br>
    As he opened the door the spurt became a continuous stream, shooting out from between
    Susie&#146;s legs in a crystal arc through the air and down onto the cold stone of the
    patio. He ran with Susie across the grass, a trail of sparkling droplets left behind, and
    finally set her down against the garden fence. She flopped back and leant against it, her
    eyes closed, sobbing quietly, as the cascade continued to flow, a clear stream reaching
    out in front of her, drenching the grass.<br>
    <br>
    Robert was rooted to the spot as he watched her. He had never seen anything like it. He
    had never seen a girl do this before. He had always thought with a girl it would be more
    random, showering out in different directions, but this was a clear flow, like his own, a
    curved line of clear, yellowish water stretching out quite a long way.<br>
    <br>
    As if in slow motion, Susie&#146;s head lifted, and her eyes opened, to look up at Robert.
    Their eyes met, connected. The force of the stream dwindled. Susie wasn&#146;t crying any
    more. The last tear fell from her face, plunged downwards, spinning, the sunlight flashing
    on its surface, before it plopped down onto the grass between Susie&#146;s feet, mixing in
    with the puddle that had already formed there.<br>
    <br>
    Susie was smiling sweetly again, apologetically. She let out a tiny giggle, and lifted up
    her skirt slowly. Robert looked down at her darkened, almost transparent white panties as
    the stream drew closer to her and became a trickle, then a few drops, and then stopped.
    She looked back up, dropped the skirt, and flopped forwards into his arms.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;God, I&#146;m sorry.&#146; she said.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Ah don&#146;t worry about it.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;It&#146;s so embarrassing though, you must have been so embarrassed, I&#146;m so
    embarrassed...&#146; She started to sob again. Robert patted her on the back.<br>
    <br>
    &#145;Stop that, it&#146;s okay, it doesn&#146;t matter. Clothes wash, carpets wash, and
    I&#146;m close to getting Beckie free. We can keep her in there a little longer while we
    clean up, right? It&#146;s no problem.&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie stood back. &#145;You&#146;re sure?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    &#145;I&#146;m sure. Are you okay?&#146;<br>
    <br>
    Susie wiped the tears from her cheek and nodded. She turned and started to walk back up
    toward the house. Robert followed her, never taking his eyes off her. Her skirt was mostly
    dry, although there were a few splashed areas on the back and front. Her legs were still
    shiny and wet, but they were starting to dry off in the sun. He didn&#146;t like to linger
    on it, but his mind was telling him things. But, there was work to be done. He shook his
    head, and thought of England.<br>
