    <br>
    Parker wasn't in the school marching band -- he couldn't have kept step if he wanted to,
    which he didn't -- but he often hung out with band kids. When the band director asked his
    musicians if they knew anyone who could use a video camera well to film their practices
    and performances, Parker's name came up, and as such he was roped into being the band's AV
    guy. He didn't mind; it meant he could spend time with his band buddies, and while he
    wasn't getting paid, the band director always had free food for him, and that was pretty
    awesome. Plus, Parker was thinking about being a movie cameraman, or somehow work in
    films, so it was great experience. Last but not least, it meant he soon got the job of
    filming the drill team, too.<br>
    <br>
    The drill team was made up of girls who didn't quite have a cheerleader personality, but
    still wanted to perform in short skirts and tight sweaters; they developed complicated and
    often quite challenging routines, and in general looked much more impressive than the
    cheerleaders because they focused on one or two routines and practiced intensely, rather
    than trying to do ten or fifteen like the cheer squad did. The drill team wore skirts that
    almost never went below mid-thigh, with sheer tights underneath, and their sweaters
    usually showed off other assets to a nice advantage, so watching them perform was never a
    problem for Parker. Especially watching Kayleigh.<br>
    <br>
    Kayleigh was a very slender girl, so much so that Parker and others occasionally worried
    she was anorexic; she had long light brown hair, a cute round face and enormous, innocent
    eyes. For whatever reason she had convinced herself that she was dumb, and despite
    occasional flashes of brilliance that showed she was quite wrong about that, she usually
    acted the part of the dumb girl to perfection. But after three years on the drill team she
    was one of the squad's sharpest performers, and her short skirt showed off her long legs
    quite well. Parker had a minor crush on her -- in part because he was determined to show
    her how smart she really was, in part because she was very cute, and in part because she
    seemed to have a bladder the size of a peanut- a small peanut. It seemed that every time
    the team neared performance time she would rush to the bathroom, and then dash to the
    toilet again as soon as the routine was done.<br>
    <br>
    Parker would sometimes get called in to film the team during the week before a big show,
    so the girls would know where the rough spots were and what to work on. Sometimes the
    girls asked him to wait and film them again later, to see their improvement. He would hang
    out watching them, even giving helpful hints from the sidelines on the odd occasion. When
    the girls practiced during the summer they sometimes had to use an older, hotter gym. In
    their sports bras and booty shorts, glistening with sweat, they were quite a sight -- and
    they tore through a lot of water. Parker made a habit of filling their water bottles now
    and again, and would sometimes run other errands. Because of his solid &quot;nice
    guy&quot; reputation, the girls never felt uncomfortable with him as a spectator. A big
    parade drew near, a three-mile march through May sunshine. As it was the last big event of
    the marching band season, the director wanted to end strong. The drill team had one
    marching routine, and decided to join as well. Both naturally asked Parker to film their
    performance.<br>
    <br>
    The group met at the school, then hopped on school buses and drove to the parade site. It
    was a warm afternoon and the band director handed out bottled water to his crew. Parker
    swiped a few and took them up to the drill team as well, who would march in front.
    Remembering past experience he kept an eye on Kayleigh, and indeed as the starting-off
    moment approached she began to squirm her customary pre-performance pee dance. She looked
    around wildly but saw no porta-potties or any other place she could find relief.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she squealed to her closest friends, &quot;if I can't go pee before
    we start...&quot; She didn't finish. &quot;Where are the porta-potties?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker, deciding he didn't need to see her squirming -- and also concerned about her --
    trotted off to find someplace for her to go. There was indeed a big bank of porta-potties
    nearby, tucked around a corner and therefore out of sight, and the lines weren't bad at
    all. Parker wasn't sure if he was glad to find them or not, but he was still too nice a
    guy to leave Kayleigh to suffer. He hurried back.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Kayleigh,&quot; Parker called, but just then the band director blew his whistle.
    &quot;We're starting in a minute!&quot; the director shouted, pointing to the groups
    forming up ahead of them. &quot;Everyone get in your places!&quot; With a panicked squeal
    Kayleigh got herself into line.<br>
    <br>
    Parker noticed Kayleigh glancing around desperately, but he had to get his camera ready
    and there was no telling when the group needed to march. As usual, it was a case of
    &quot;hurry up and wait.&quot; Despite being called to attention and readied to march, it
    was at least another four minutes before the drum majors counted off the cadence and began
    the march. Parker was sure that Kayleigh could have run and peed before they started, but
    as it was, she held her place in line with a minimum of fidgeting.<br>
    <br>
    Once into the march itself, it seemed that the effort of keeping in step, her knees high,
    and making her pom-poms snap at the right moments distracted Kayleigh entirely. Parker,
    doing his duty, swept the group with his camera repeatedly, but he also shut it off
    occasionally to save the battery, and then he walked along between the band and the drill
    squad. As Kayleigh was a tall girl they'd put her near the back, and Parker's positioning
    allowed him to keep a close eye on her.<br>
    <br>
    All parades have stops and starts, and plenty of slowdowns. A three-mile march might take
    six hours. Luckily for everyone this one was a little faster, and they hit the last mile
    before three hours had elapsed. Despite missing her usual pre-performance pee, Kayleigh
    seemed to be handling her bladder just fine, never missing a beat or letting her cute
    smile slip. Parker began to suspect that the whole thing was just nerves; Kayleigh,
    despite her years of experience and her sharp performances, never seemed to accept that
    she was actually quite good.<br>
    <br>
    On the third mile, however, Parker began to notice that she was a touch out of step, and
    that her smile was a little strained. After three hours all the drill squad girls were
    smiling a little too fixedly, but Parker thought he could tell that Kayleigh's smile was
    beginning to spiral down into a grimace. While trying not to be too obvious, Parker kept
    an eye on her legs. Would he see a telltale streak down one side? Or was he just imagining
    things?<br>
    <br>
    As the drill team and the band marched across the finish line Kayleigh was definitely off
    step, but so were several other girls on the team, and half the band as well; sheer
    exhaustion might account for that. But as soon as they all fell out of formation, Kayleigh
    turned to her nearest friend, whispered something, and crossed her legs tightly. The other
    girl, a curvy blonde named Claire, nodded vigorously.<br>
    <br>
    The buses had driven around from the starting point to meet them. Because hiring the buses
    came out of the school budget and were paid for by the hour, the band director wanted
    everyone back on the buses as quickly as possible; if they didn't get back to school in
    the next thirty minutes or so, the band would be charged another two hundred dollars.
    &quot;Everyone back on the bus!&quot; he hollered. &quot;C'mon, let's get going!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Kayleigh and Claire looked panic-stricken at this. Kayleigh was too shy to open her mouth,
    but Claire started to say, &quot;Some of us need to use the bathroom.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can go at the school,&quot; the band director said, clearly not really paying
    attention as he herded more people towards the long yellow buses.<br>
    <br>
    Kayleigh and Claire glanced at each other, truly worried expressions on their faces, but
    they got on. Parker got on the same bus they did, but he couldn't sit near enough to them
    to hear their conversation. In a way he was relieved. The ride back to school was actually
    relatively quick; the band would keep its money. But Parker, whose mind barely got off
    Kayleigh and Claire the entire trip, felt every second, and every bump in the road, in
    sympathetic agony. He didn't need to pee at all himself -- but sympathy was wrestling with
    guilty delight in his mind, and sympathy was still winning- for now.<br>
    <br>
    The kids and the two or three parent chaperones that accompanied them piled off the bus
    and headed for the band room. Parker manoeuvred himself close to Kayleigh and Claire.
    Another of Kayleigh's friends, Anna, had joined them. The three were talking in low tones.<br>
    <br>
    The main school doors were locked, of course -- it was a Saturday. The band therefore
    trooped halfway around the school building to where the band room's exterior door was.
    This put them backed up against a little-used parking lot, a falling-down portable
    building used for storage, and beyond them the tennis courts and two athletic fields. A
    few trees stood on a dirt patch between the parking lot and the fields. No one could be
    seen in that direction.<br>
    <br>
    The band reached the band room door and then piled up there, unable to get in. The
    director had locked the door, of course, and he had the key. No one knew where he was. Now
    it turned out that the director had made a rather substantial miscalculation. He was an
    excellent musician and a pretty good teacher but he was horrible at navigation. He'd
    followed the buses to the parade site, parked his car, and then walked along with the
    band. While the buses circled around to collect the group, no one had brought the
    director's car, meaning he had to walk a good two miles back to find his vehicle, and only
    then did he start going home -- only to take a few wrong turns that deposited him on a
    highway going in the opposite direction. Realizing that the band would be waiting for him,
    he called one of the chaperones to let them know he wouldn't be there for at least half an
    hour. At this point the band and the drill team had been piled up outside the band room,
    waiting to get in and collect their belongings, for some time already.<br>
    <br>
    Parker, who had left his car keys in the band room, was as trapped as everyone else. He
    stowed his video camera in its bag and sat down near where Kayleigh and a group of girls
    stood. Kayleigh had her legs crossed and was shifting her weight from foot to foot.
    Neither was she alone. Claire also had her legs crossed, and Anna and several of the other
    girls were jiggling a little as Parker watched.<br>
    <br>
    Then the chaperone made the announcement that the band director wasn't going get there for
    half an hour. Claire threw her head back and groaned; Kayleigh looked terrified. One of
    the boys in the group said, &quot;That does it, I'm finding a bush,&quot; and walked off
    to the tennis courts and the trees there. After a moment's hesitation, another boy
    followed. Parker looked back at the girls he'd been observing; Claire was looking
    profoundly envious, Anna looked calculating. More whispered conversation followed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can't,&quot; Kayleigh wailed in answer to a question from Anna.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, we're stuck too,&quot; Anna said. &quot;Worse than you are, even...&quot; but
    then she lowered her voice again. Kayleigh shook her head again. Claire looked dubious
    too, until she jerked a little, and made an abortive grab towards her groin, pulling her
    hand back before she did. She glanced around; Parker looked away, but he was afraid she'd
    caught him looking. Out of the corner of his eye he saw she was doing a little dance,
    pretending it was part of the routine.<br>
    <br>
    Then suddenly Anna came over to where Parker sat and crouched down in front of him.<br>
    <br>
    Parker liked Anna a lot; she was sweet, funny, down-to-earth, and also a cutie with a trim
    runner's body and bright eyes -- which made her practically unique at their school. Not as
    willowy as Kayleigh or blonde-bombshell like Claire, she played clarinet, which matched
    her personality well -- not as flighty as the flute players, not as brazen as the
    saxophones, not as abrasive as the drummers. She was wearing the usual band uniform:
    jacket over uniform pants. She'd undone her jacket to reveal that the uniform pants were
    actually overalls of a sort.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Parker,&quot; she said, &quot;do you know any other way to get into the building? A
    lot of us need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't have any keys to the outside doors,&quot; Parker said. &quot;I've got keys
    to the tech room and that's it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, we knew you hung out with Justin, and people say he's got a master key.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker smiled. &quot;Justin's got way more keys than he should. He doesn't have a master,
    though.&quot; He paused. &quot;But he might have a door key, wouldn't surprise me -- and
    he just lives a couple blocks over, he could be here in two minutes.&quot; He pulled out
    his cell phone and called his buddy. Anna looked hopeful.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What's up, man?&quot; Justin said on the other end of the line.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey, man, do you have a key to the school?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why d'you ask?&quot; Justin said warily.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to get in.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Anna put her hands together in a silent begging gesture, mouthing a fervent
    &quot;Please!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well...&quot; Justin said, &quot;I don't have a key to the main building, but I do
    know a way in.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, it's kind of complicated, I'd need to show you... and you'd need a classroom
    key.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you have one?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Promise not to tell?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come off it, man, I know you've got it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, I do...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Dude, get over here!&quot; Anna perked up as she heard him say this.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Wait, are you at school right now?&quot; Justin asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, man. We need to get in. How long can you wait?&quot; Parker asked Anna.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Five minutes?&quot; Anna said, a worried grimace spreading over her features.
    &quot;And Kayleigh and Claire are about to explode.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to get in, like, ten minutes ago,&quot; Parker told Justin.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry, I'm way over in the city.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker swore. &quot;Not helpful, Justin!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, sorry, but I had plans....&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, yeah, it's not your fault,&quot; Parker said. &quot;Kind of a surprise
    situation for all of us.&quot; He said goodbye hurriedly and hung up. &quot;No luck,&quot;
    he said.<br>
    <br>
    Anna looked very worried at this point. &quot;Okay, that's not good- because all of us
    really need to go. I think Kayleigh's about to pee her pants, she hasn't gone since before
    the parade.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker decided not to mention that he'd been well aware of the state of Kayleigh's bladder
    for the last two and a half hours.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can you find a bush?&quot; Parker asked, half-ashamed of asking.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well...&quot; Anna said, &quot;Kayleigh says she can't pee outside. And us band
    girls have our uniforms to deal with.&quot; She opened her jacket wider to show him the
    overall shape. &quot;We'd have to take the pants all the way off, and some of us aren't
    wearing much underneath, you see? We'd pretty much have to get naked, and we can't do that
    unless we can find a really private spot.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker restrained himself from making the obvious smart-aleck remarks that this prompted
    in his mind. He considered, for a moment, just saying, &quot;Sorry, I can't help,&quot;
    and waiting to see what happened next. But the same feelings that allowed him to restrain
    his dirty comments also forced him to do something.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How about I run around to all the doors and see if the custodians left one
    unlocked?&quot; he said. It was a forlorn hope -- he knew how thorough the janitors could
    be -- but he had to take some kind of action.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks so much, Parker,&quot; Anna said, rising to her feet.<br>
    <br>
    Parker was glad to get away from the growing crowd of fidgeting females. He avoided the
    small cluster of boys peeing against the trees and began trotting around the building,
    trying every door he found. Three minutes later he arrived back where he started, somewhat
    out of breath and not sure whether he was disappointed or relieved.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Did you find a door?&quot; Anna asked. Now she, too, had her legs crossed, and poor
    Kayleigh was doing a rather impressive and decidedly noticeable pee dance. Anyone within
    sight could tell what her trouble was.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry,&quot; Parker said. &quot;There's no way in.&quot; He hesitated.
    &quot;Nobody's going to get here with a key for another twenty minutes. As far as I can
    tell you either need to find a bush or pee your pants.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Anna bit her lip, considering these two not-terribly palatable options.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I really don't want to wet my pants,&quot; she said, &quot;but the thing is, if we
    go pee in a bush I just know some of the guys are going to try and sneak a peak. I know
    you wouldn't, you're such a nice guy, but those other guys...&quot; she pointed to two of
    the more obnoxious boys. &quot;There's no way, not if we have to pretty much strip down.
    We've got to find a good hiding spot and then keep them away.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker wasn't as sure as she was that he wouldn't try to look. But the gallantry in him
    took over. &quot;I'll keep them away from you,&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you,&quot; Anna said fervently. Then she looked around. &quot;Where's the best
    spot, do you think?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker thought, remembering the circuit around the campus that he'd just done, and then
    said, &quot;There's a staircase down to the boiler room, the custodians use it sometimes.
    If you go down right next to the door, nobody can see you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Anna nodded. &quot;Sounds good. Now let's get Kayleigh and Claire over there before they
    pop.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately the boiler room was just around the corner. Anna explained the situation to
    her group -- by now six girls including her, about half band and half drill. The girls
    were by now desperate enough to grab at straws.<br>
    <br>
    As the group followed Parker, however, one of the chaperons called out to them.
    &quot;Where are you going, kids?&quot; It was one of the moms.<br>
    <br>
    The girls looked at each other. Anna glanced at Parker, who wasn't about to explain that
    he was taking the girls around a corner for a little public urination, not to someone
    almost old enough to be his grandmother.<br>
    <br>
    Anna must have sensed that no one was about to explain, so she said, &quot;Mrs. Butler, we
    all really need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The director said he'd be here in ten minutes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The girls, knowing that the director was not known for punctuality, especially when cars
    were involved, glanced at each other. Parker, having been leading the group, was now
    behind them, and saw Claire, not terribly subtly, reach behind herself as if to check for
    damp spots. All the girls were clearly nearing the wetting point. Anna again spoke for the
    group.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mrs. Butler, we really can't wait to get inside. We need to go now. It's hot, we've
    been drinking a lot of water... some of us haven't gone for hours.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mrs. Butler looked confused. &quot;Where are you going, then?&quot; Some onlookers were
    starting to gather.<br>
    <br>
    Anna glanced at Parker. &quot;Parker says he knows a spot where we can kind of get out of
    sight.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Where?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker explained, as quickly as possible.<br>
    <br>
    The grandmotherly woman wrinkled her nose. &quot;A stairway? No, that's disgusting.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, god, no,&quot; Claire muttered. She had one hand pressed against her groin now.<br>
    <br>
    Parker saw two boys who had come over and were eying the girls with clear interest,
    grinning and clearly enjoying the situation. Rage at the situation, sympathy for the
    bursting girls, and rage at himself for enjoying their discomfort so much all pooled, and
    he snapped at Mrs. Butler, &quot;Well, if they can't go on the stairs, find a better spot
    for them. Anywhere's fine, just as long as you keep those guys from watching.&quot; And he
    pointed to the onlookers.<br>
    <br>
    Mrs. Butler turned, and saw the open lust on the boys' faces just before they realized she
    was looking at them and tried to look innocent. That was apparently enough. &quot;All
    right, everyone back to the band room!&quot; she snapped, making shooing gestures with her
    hands and seemingly oblivious to the six frantic ladies she'd just been talking to.<br>
    <br>
    Taking advantage of her distraction, Parker said, &quot;Come on, right around here.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The girls trotted around the corner and out of Mrs. Butler's sight, as quickly as they
    could with full bladders. Parker pointed. &quot;Right down there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire burst into... well, not a full run, because that would have made her wet herself
    for certain, but a quicker jog. She got to the stairway ahead of the rest and trotted down
    it. Parker realized, however, that he'd misjudged the stairwell's depth; even standing at
    the bottom, Claire was still about one-third visible.<br>
    <br>
    She wasn't standing for long, however. She squatted down and out of sight.<br>
    <br>
    The other girls, reaching the stairwell, looked down to where Claire had her skirt up and
    was desperately tugging at her tights and panties. After a second's struggle, however, she
    had them down and the hissing rush of her pee filled their ears. Parker stole one highly
    guilty glance and then made himself move a few steps away, facing the other direction.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There's only room for one,&quot; said Jennifer, a band girl Parker barely knew.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's fine, we can squat on the stairs,&quot; said Monica, another drill team girl,
    and she hurried down and squatted next to where Claire was still pissing out a river.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We can still see you,&quot; Jennifer pointed out, &quot;and we have to take our
    uniforms all the way off.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll go last,&quot; Anna said, but then she turned to Kayleigh. &quot;Kayleigh, you
    can go.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Kayleigh was by now doing quite the pee dance. First she bent slightly, stamping from foot
    to foot while keeping her legs pressed close together, arms a little back, breasts hanging
    down and pressing against her sweater. Then she straightened up and pressed both hands
    between her legs, which hiked up her skirt. She bounced up and down, then bent forward
    again. She was crying.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can't, I can't,&quot; she said. &quot;I just can't, I gotta peeeee...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Anna took her by both her shoulders. &quot;So do I, we'll do it together, okay? And Parker
    will keep anyone from seeing us&quot; -- Parker hastily glanced away again -- &quot;and
    it'll be all right, okay? I don't want you to pee yourself.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm already peeing myself,&quot; Kayleigh burst out with a sob.<br>
    <br>
    Parker wrestled with himself for a long, long time, but in the end he couldn't resist one
    look. Kayleigh had pulled her skirt up at the front, apparently to show Anna what was
    happening beneath it. She still had her other hand pressed against her groin, but a dark
    stain was growing fast, and streaks of liquid were beginning to run down her tights.<br>
    <br>
    Claire had at last finished. She came up the steps past the still-pissing Monica, who had
    her head back as she sighed with the bliss of long-awaited relief. Jennifer took Claire's
    place at the bottom of the steps and started undoing her uniform. When Parker realized
    that she was only wearing a sports bra underneath her overalls he looked away... although
    admittedly he looked straight back at Kayleigh. Anna, who was still standing cross-legged,
    was hugging her friend. Kayleigh's cheeks looked as wet as her tights. Monica and Claire
    joined the embrace, but their looks of sympathy were clearly laced with expressions of
    vast relief.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;At least you feel better now, right?&quot; Claire said to Kayleigh.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I wet my pants!&quot; Kayleigh wailed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But you don't need to pee anymore, do you?&quot; Anna pointed out. &quot;I still
    have to go so bad! Tell you what, though, I don't think your skirt got wet at all. Take
    your tights off, no one will notice.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As the other two drill girls supervised this, Anna clamped a hand over her own groin and
    shifted from foot to foot, waiting for the other band girls to finish. As the process of
    getting out of the overalls was not an easy one, this took some time, but Anna valiantly
    held on until the stairs were clear. Parker allowed himself a glance backward, and caught
    a glimpse of Anna just getting into a squat. Yes, she too had only worn a bra under the
    uniform, and not a sports bra at that. No wonder she needed some privacy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Parker,&quot; Claire called, &quot;Could you go get my purse? It's black, with a cat
    on it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker hurried to do as he was bid. When he returned, Anna had finished peeing. Kayleigh
    had her tights and panties off, but her skirt was back down and concealed everything...
    barely. It was an awfully short skirt. Claire used some tissues from her purse to wipe
    Kayleigh's tears away, until the girl looked somewhat better.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Parker, you won't tell anyone what happened to Kayleigh, will you?&quot; Claire
    demanded.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;My lips are sealed,&quot; he answered gravely.<br>
    <br>
    Anna grinned. &quot;You were so nice today, Parker,&quot; she said. &quot;We all would
    have peed in our pants if you hadn't found this spot. And what you said to Mrs. Butler! I
    just about cheered.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I was so pissed at her... umm...&quot; He stopped himself as he realized what he'd
    said.<br>
    <br>
    Anna laughed. &quot;I was just about ready to piss on her. We were all about to explode,
    and she was just standing there telling us how disgusting it was... like it was our
    fault.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You were doing pretty well by yourself,&quot; Parker said, &quot;but I just got so
    mad. Especially at those boys checking you out, that really... ticked me off. I was ready
    to kick their asses right there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You wouldn't have actually hurt them, would you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, yes I would have,&quot; Parker said. He didn't mention that he felt like beating
    himself up too. &quot;How else was I going to keep them from spying on you? And I really
    wanted to give you some privacy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Really?&quot; Anna said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Totally.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So you didn't sneak any peeks?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; Parker said, but he knew it sounded weak. Anna raised an eyebrow.
    &quot;Well, maybe one.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She grinned again, and nodded. &quot;That's better. And I'm glad you told the truth,
    'cause I don't like dating liars.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Parker blinked. &quot;Wait, we're dating now?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You're objecting? Didn't like what you saw after all?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He blushed bright red.<br>
    <br>
    Anna laughed out loud and tucked her hand into his.<br>
    <br>
    Parker could only hope, desperately, that she never found out how much of the truth he'd
    kept back.<br>
