    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Note:&nbsp; This story contains
    Female Desperation.</span></strong></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A few years ago I worked part-time
    as a bartender in a strip club.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was easy
    work, the money was good and the scenery was great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
    Wednesday afternoon around 6:00 or so I was quietly tending bar when the owners of a
    little mom and pop company that supplied the machines for the bathrooms came in.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only did they supply the condom and tampon
    machines; they also took care of the electric air fresheners in each bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a good time for them to be there as the
    after work crowd had thinned and the evening crowd had not arrived yet. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The bathrooms were right across from
    the bar and they had been in the women's bathroom for a few minutes when one of the
    employees came out and told me that they would be in there a few minutes to fix the air
    freshener.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently it had quit working and
    they were taking it apart to fix it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
    think too much about it, as the vast majority of our customers were men. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of minutes later Lacey came
    to the bar to get her second drink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had
    found a customer who wanted to buy her a drink a few minutes earlier and now this customer
    was buying her a second drink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told me
    what she wanted and said she would be right back, as she needed to &quot;take a little
    tinkle.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told Lacey that the bathroom
    people were in there fixing the air freshener and she quietly muttered, &quot;Damn, I
    guess I will just have to wait.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave
    Lacey her $15.00 drink, she gave me the $5.00 the house made, the $4.00 I made and had me
    put the $6.00 she made in her tip jar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
    the girls kept their tip jars behind the bar for a couple of reasons.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>First the dressing room was small and there was
    nowhere to lock things up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, all the
    girls knew me and knew that I would never steal from them or let anyone else steal from
    them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girls each danced three songs.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was a teaser, top and g-string on.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The second song was the pleaser, where they took
    of their tops and the last song was the pay off where they dropped their bottoms.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Satin was finishing her third song and Lacey came
    back to the bar for some quarters for the jukebox for her three songs.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I was getting her the quarters,
    she asked if they were through yet, doing a little pee dance.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think she was that bad off at that point,
    as Lacey tended to be a bit of an actress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    figured she was just putting on a little show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    I told her no they were still in there I could tell by the look on her face that she
    really needed to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She took the money and
    went and picked her three songs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the first song hit I knew she
    was really in trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Lacey was one of our
    better dances and she had a particular style of music and songs she always chose from.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first song was not anywhere near what she
    would usually pick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then it dawned on me;
    this was one of the shortest songs on the jukebox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
    barely 2 minutes long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at that point
    that I realized that there was going to be more show here than anyone else ever imagined.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lacey's first dance was quick and
    she never slowed down a second, always moving, especially her feet.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't have that usual smile on her face
    either, just a forced looking grin that a couple of times turned into a grimace.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When her first song ended she just
    paced waiting for the next song to begin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yep
    you guessed it, another short fast song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
    her style at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her second song usually was
    a slow one that she would tease the guys on pervert row with.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lots of times it was a floorshow on a furry rug
    the girls kept on the stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not this time,
    she just kept moving, and as she did her best to give a show, running her hands on the
    body, I noticed that her hand seemed to stay in her crotch a few seconds longer and she
    was giving herself a quick squeeze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
    second song was over she quickly sat on the steps of the stage to take a breather.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could see that she had one hand between her legs
    at her knees with her knees together on her hand, and the other hand, the one away from
    the customers was in her crotch and she was squeezing tightly.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was also wiggling ever so slightly on the
    stage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The third song came on and it was a
    medium slow song, the kind that most of the girls used when they were dropping their
    bottoms.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This one was again one of the
    really short ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was glad that the boss
    wasn't here to see this, as he would have been pissed at Lacey for choosing three short
    songs in a row. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the slower more rhythmic song
    progressed I could see that Lacey was really in trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>All of a sudden this girl had no rhythm at all.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her moves were stiff and her legs were together a
    lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried to make it look sexy with her
    running her hands on her bare breasts and down to her g-string, but even these moves were
    jerky and she was holding her crotch too much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
    once did she come close to using the pole that was on the dance floor and she was one of
    the best pole dancers around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When it came time to drop her
    g-string I knew she was about to lose it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    committed one of the cardinal sins in this or any club at that time in our town.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once your bottom was off you DID NOT touch your
    crotch with your hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The cops if they had
    been there would be all over you if you did for lewd conduct.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lacey just couldn't help it, when
    she went into a half squat her hand shot to her crotch and she gave a hard squeeze.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The look on her face was one of terror and Angel
    another dance, who just happened to be sitting at the bar getting ready to go on next
    looked at me and said &quot;what the fuck is she doing, trying to go to jail?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The second her song was over she
    grabbed her clothes and was off that stage headed to the ladies room.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately it was still occupied.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she got to the bar she asked &quot;are they
    out of there yet, I am about to pee all over this floor.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her no and the tears started to well up in
    her eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had a hand jammed in her crotch
    and was hopping around behind the end of the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    couldn't even get her clothes on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She kept
    saying over and over, &quot;I got to pee, I got to pee, oh God, I'm about to pee.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I told her that if it was that bad
    she could go in the men's room and I would guard the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She stated that there was no way she was peeing in the men's room- it was
    just too gross.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a couple of minutes of dancing
    around and begging for the people in the ladies room to hurry up she finally looked at me
    and said &quot;Ok, I'll pee in the men's room cause I'm about to pee on the floor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She took one step towards the men's room when two
    men walked up to the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One entered and
    the other stood outside waiting his turn.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That was the last straw.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lacey looked at me with pleading, tear streaked
    eyes, both hand jammed in her crotch, bouncing butt ass naked and said now what am I gonna
    do, I'm about to pee on the floor and I can't wait any longer.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I always kept a couple of 5-gallon
    pickle buckets under the bar for trash, cleaner or what ever.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I quickly pulled an empty one out and set it in
    the corner behind the bar where no one could see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Lacey
    looked at me wide eyed shook her head no, but then a couple seconds later dashed for the
    bucket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She squatted over the bucket and
    looked around to see if anyone could she her at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Squatting over that bucket, no one could even see the top of her head.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A giant squirt of piss shot from her
    neatly trimmed tan topped pussy and splattered loudly into the bottom of the bucket in my
    full view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could not take my eyes of Lacey
    and the waterfall of pee coming from her gorgeous neatly trimmed pussy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She peed for what seemed like hours.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was long enough that one of Angel's songs ended
    and to cover the noise of Lacey peeing into the bucket I turned on the faucet into the
    half full sink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The look of relief on her
    face was amazing and when I turned on the sink to cover the sound of her pee hitting the
    liquid in the bottom of the bucket she mouthed a quick thank you to me.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the last drops fell from her
    tight little pussy and she realize she had one last little problem.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled and shook her tight little butt several
    times to get the last drops off, slipped her g-string on and stood up.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She looked around to see if anyone
    besides me had seen her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She realize that I
    was the only one, walked up to me very red faced, reached up and kissed me, telling me
    thanks, cause she really did just about pee on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She told me that no one had ever seen her pee before and that if I
    told anyone about what happened, she would kill me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    smiled at her as she walked away and told her &quot;your secret's safe with
    me..........peanut bladder.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know, a
    girl could put a guy's eye out throwing a rhinestone covered bikini top at him.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later that evening Lacey proved to me that there
    were other things she could do behind that bar and no one could see.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that's another story............... <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
