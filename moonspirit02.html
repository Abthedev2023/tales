    color="#000000">For some reason, I have always been shy about telling anyone that I needed
    to use the bathroom.&nbsp; Most of the time, if there were no facilities around when my
    need arose, I just held it silently.&nbsp; This story is about one of those times, but
    after a few hours, I could no longer keep silent (or dry)!!!<br>
    <br>
    Chris and I awoke early.&nbsp; It was a beautiful summer Saturday and we planned to get
    our errands done early, and then enjoy the day together doing absolutely nothing but
    enjoying nature.&nbsp; We went to the supermarket, the dry-cleaners, the pharmacy, and the
    garden shop.&nbsp; After all of this running around, we stopped at a diner for breakfast.
    &nbsp; When we finished our meal, Chris went up to the counter to pay the bill and I
    headed for the ladies' room.&nbsp; Of course, I never said where I was going, only
    &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to pee, but was not bursting.&nbsp; Upon
    arrival at the ladies' room, I saw a sign saying &quot;caution...wet floor.&quot;&nbsp; As
    it turned out, the ladies room was closed because the cleaning men were cleaning a mess
    left by its previous occupant.&nbsp; I asked how long before I could enter, and the man
    told me it would be about 15 minutes.&nbsp; I could have easily waited it out, as I didn't
    have to go that badly, but that would have meant that I would have to tell Chris I had to
    go.&nbsp; I'm shy about that, so I couldn't do it. I just walked out into the diner, met
    Chris at the door, and left with him.<br>
    <br>
    Chris drove home to put our packages away.&nbsp; He told me to wait in the car and that he
    could handle the three small bags we purchased at the stores.&nbsp; Again, I couldn't tell
    him about my need to pee, so I just said &quot;fine.&quot;&nbsp; I watched as he walked
    into the house with the packages.&nbsp; I know I should have just gone in with him so that
    I could relieve my now aching bladder. Chris was in the house for about eight minutes, so
    I knew he must have used the bathroom.&nbsp; Well, at least one of us was comfortable!<br>
    <br>
    When he got back in the car he told me that he decided to go to the beach.&nbsp; It was
    kind of cool for sunbathing, but relaxing on the beach sounded great.&nbsp; We were both
    wearing shorts and tee shirts, and had sweatshirts tied around our waists.&nbsp; Traffic
    moved briskly on our hour-long drive to the beach, but every bump we hit sent a pain
    through my midsection. I had to pee - BADLY!&nbsp; The words were on the tip of my tongue
    &quot;please stop at a gas station, I gotta pee&quot;... but I could not say them. So I
    suffered, in silence. I occasionally crossed my legs to ease the tension, but it was more
    like a casual crossing of the legs rather than a &quot;I gotta go&quot; crossing.
    &nbsp; The only way I could get a bit of relief was to lean forward a bit so that my
    peehole was pushed tightly against the car seat.&nbsp; Even then, I knew that if I relaxed
    just a bit, I'd lose some urine when I shifted position, so I held my bladder muscles
    tightly.<br>
    <br>
    Just before we arrived at the beach, Chris pulled into a gas station and asked the
    attendant to fill the tank.&nbsp; My hand was on the door, and I could see myself getting
    out of the car and walking to the bathroom.&nbsp; It was hard for me to say the words, so
    I just said, &quot;be right back,&quot; and walked out of the car. My bladder felt like it
    was about to explode. I had to walk around the building to the bathroom, but the door was
    locked. There was a sign on the door that read &quot;please obtain key from
    attendant.&quot;&nbsp; This was going to be hard for me - remember, I'm shy about letting
    people know I've gotta pee, and this would entail walking to the front of the building,
    where Chris would see me asking for the key.&nbsp; I had no choice, I was about to burst.
    &nbsp; When I got to the front of the building, Chris was paying for his gas purchase. I
    waved at him and then asked an attendant for the key.&nbsp; I was told that the bathrooms
    were out of order. Chris was watching, and I didn't want him to know that I couldn't use a
    bathroom, so I walked back behind the building so that he would think everything was fine.
    &nbsp; I had to go so badly now, that I didn't think I could walk back to the car
    normally. I looked around and saw no one.&nbsp; I had to go - right now!&nbsp;&nbsp; I
    contemplated unzipping my shorts and pulling them down so that I could squat right there,
    behind the building to relieve my aching bladder.&nbsp; I feared that someone would come
    walking by and did not want to get caught with my pants around my ankles, so I opted to
    pull my shorts and panties to the side, and pee standing up.<br>
    <br>
    One more quick look around told me that I was alone, so I proceeded to pull my shorts to
    the side.&nbsp; I started to pee slowly, just a few drops at a time.&nbsp; This wasn't
    easy, as the pee was running down the inside of my legs and wetting my sneakers.&nbsp; Oh,
    but it felt so good! I'd peed a few drops, hold it, and then pee again.&nbsp; I didn't
    want to let it all out at once, because I knew it would gush and wet the sides of my
    shorts, as well as my legs and sneakers.&nbsp; My bladder wanted total release and I began
    to pee hard and strong.&nbsp; Just then, a man and a child came around the building. I let
    go of my shorts and tightened my bladder muscle for all I was worth.&nbsp; I had to bend
    at the waist to stop from peeing all over myself at that point.&nbsp; Luckily, I regained
    control and told the guy and his kid that the bathrooms were out of commission.&nbsp; I
    then walked back to the car.&nbsp; My thighs were shaking from the pressure of trying to
    hold back the piss I had started to take.&nbsp; I sat in the passengers seat and
    immediately crossed my legs - tightly!&nbsp; The rest of the ride to the beach was agony
    for me.&nbsp; The pee was right at the tip of my peehole and I couldn't hold on much
    longer.&nbsp; I was using every muscle in my body to hold it back at this point and
    couldn't carry on a normal conversation with Chris.<br>
    <br>
    Finally we got to the beach and parked the car.&nbsp; Walking was no easy task, but I
    tried to smile and make like nothing was wrong.&nbsp; We found a spot and spread out the
    blanket.&nbsp; I was wishing it was warmer and we were in bathing suits, for I would have
    gone into the ocean and peed at that point.&nbsp; We laid on the blanket.&nbsp; I was on
    my stomach with my hand underneath me pressed tight against my peehole.&nbsp; Chris
    decided to go get us a drink.&nbsp; Right there, on the beach, I scooted my ass off the
    blanket, pulled my shorts to the side, and started to pee again.&nbsp; I was peeing so
    furiously that a puddle was forming in the sand and I had to lift my butt up.&nbsp; It had
    to be obvious to everyone around me that I was pissing, but I didn't care, the relief felt
    so good.&nbsp; I then saw Chris rapidly approaching the blanket with two sodas.&nbsp; Once
    again, I pinched it off.&nbsp; This time wasn't so bad though.&nbsp; I had let enough out
    to be comfortable for a while.&nbsp; Of course, I still had to go, but was not bursting
    like I had been for the past hour.&nbsp; I was also thirsty, and drank the soda Chris had
    brought me quite quickly.&nbsp; Within a half an hour, my bladder was once again
    expressing its need for relief in a BIG way.&nbsp; I couldn't find a comfortable position,
    no matter how hard I tried.&nbsp; This pee wanted out - and it wanted out NOW.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A few drops escaped into my shorts. I glanced down and saw a wet spot the
    size of a quarter. I simply could not wet my pants.&nbsp;&nbsp; I jammed my hand into my
    crotch and squeezed my thighs together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon seeing this, Chris said, &quot;I
    think we should find you a bathroom.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded in the affirmative, as I
    could no longer deny my need.<br>
    <br>
    As we made our way toward the bathroom, a few more drops leaked out.&nbsp; Luckily, I had
    my sweatshirt tied around my waist, so this was not really visible.&nbsp; When we arrived
    at the bathrooms, there was a line for both the men's and women's room.&nbsp; Chris asked
    me if I was going to be able to hold it, and I nodded yes.&nbsp; I wasn't sure that I
    could hold it though, as by now, my shorts were quite damp.&nbsp; Chris must have known
    how badly I needed to go by the look on my face, because he said &quot;oh, you poor
    thing!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I told him I was fine.&nbsp; I was hopping foot to
    foot now, as pee was rolling down the inside of my legs.&nbsp; It was dribbling out and I
    couldn't stop it.&nbsp; I could control it so that it wouldn't gush out, but I simply
    could not control the spurting dribbles.&nbsp; If Chris noticed this, he didn't mention it
    to me.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, it was my turn in the ladies' stall.&nbsp; I pulled my sopping wet shorts down
    and sat on the bowl. Since I had peed in the sand, and then in my pants, there really
    wasn't much left for the toilet bowl, however sitting on the bowl with my pants down was
    such a relief.&nbsp; We walked back to our blanket, folded it up, and headed back for the
    car.&nbsp; Before we got in, Chris put the blanket on the passengers seat.&nbsp; He knew
    what had happened, but didn't embarrass me my mentioning it.&nbsp; We drove home and spent
    the rest of the afternoon making passionate love.&nbsp; Of course, I showered first!<br>
