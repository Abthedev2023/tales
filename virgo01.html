    Desperation, Humiliation and Accidental Wetting.</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is the story of Reginald. A tall, handsome, huskily built but elegant gentleman aged
    about 40. His little episode took place one evening at Bish Manor, England, ca. 1935.<br>
    <br>
    He had been with a wedding party all day, most of which took place out of doors at a vast
    estate in the English countryside. Once evening came, the party moved to an enormous
    house, practically labyrinthine, five stories or more, the rooms and passageways
    innumerable, and as Reginald was soon to discover, nearly impossible to navigate if
    unfamiliar.<br>
    <br>
    He had been out of doors and in the company of others for the entire day, (as this
    particular wedding party was very large, over two hundred people, most of them high
    aristocracy, and indeed, most of them, to Reginald, strangers).<br>
    <br>
    He was an exceedingly shy and proper gentleman, adhering at all times to codes of strict
    social decorum and manners.<br>
    <br>
    But on this particular evening, Reginald's dignity would be quite literally worn to
    nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Reginald closed the final door at the end of the massively grandiose and now dreadfully
    unfamiliar hallway. There hadn't been any facilities in THAT room either.<br>
    <br>
    So far he had examined every last room on that hall, and that was only one wing of the
    manor- as well as being only one of the five floors. He turned; his face visibly
    distressed and tried to decide on his next course of action.<br>
    <br>
    His bladder was well overfull. He'd been unable to seek relief until just minutes ago
    after hours of very constant discomfort. The feeling of heaviness beneath his fly buttons
    and snug tuxedo vest was beyond distracting, it had reached a level of painful urgency. He
    tried to think clearly. He wondered if it would be worth his while in the end to simply
    try and sneak away and search for privacy somewhere outside. But already it had begun to
    rain, and besides, to reach the outdoors, he would have to retrace his steps and make his
    way back through the reception downstairs, where there were...(he shuddered in his
    shyness)... people everywhere. If someone stopped him, even if only for a moment, well...
    considering the signals his bladder was sending him, he feared the worst.<br>
    <br>
    But he had to relieve himself of the torrents of water inside him. He absolutely HAD to.
    He'd been containing himself for so long now that the need was just terrible. He was
    almost afraid to walk. He did, however, as quickly as he dared. Though his mind was
    focused with every second on the throbbing, consistently surging muscle that felt, with
    every step, that it was seconds away from throbbing too strongly for him to bear.<br>
    <br>
    He realized his breath was shallow and quick as he made his way down the dim carpeted
    hallway. The doors of all the rooms he'd checked stood on either side, some still partway
    open. He glanced at one or two of them anxiously, seeing only classic furnishings and
    works of art, and could not help but halt in his steps. The discomfort was incredible. He
    could feel the muscles around his urethra practically vibrating with the effort it took to
    impede the inevitable flood of urine that wanted so desperately to escape. He made a
    small, whimpering sound in spite of his valiant effort to hold onto his modesty, and
    squeezed his legs together. The wave of pressure in his bladder seemed to deepen and bloom
    into a more severe state of need, and he felt even more swollen and close to the point of
    honestly bursting than he had even moments before. He despised the sensation of needing to
    pass his water and not being immediately able to do so, it terrified him. To be caught in
    such a dire and private need was not something he considered becoming to a gentleman.<br>
    <br>
    He forced himself to keep walking. It wasn't easy. His large, solid thighs were clenched,
    his ankles stiff, and he found himself slowing his hesitant gait to a full stop several
    times. His hand, not daring to fully meet his crotch, he stuck tight and flat between his
    knees. He could not believe he had to go so badly! It was awful. His bladder must have
    been enormous, barely the size that it was meant to be at all. It was hard as a rock,
    angry from having to hold so much for so long. He was suffering.<br>
    <br>
    At length he straightened his posture, allowing the particularly strong spasm to subside
    as best he could, and was ultimately able to take a few more steps. He had to hold it. He
    had to. He had literally no choice, at least until he was able to get upstairs, (more
    rooms and therefore the possibility of toilets), or downstairs, through the throngs of
    wedding guests and outside into the seclusion of the garden. Oh, God, the thought of
    urinating in the garden, or indeed any place at all was maddening. It was all he could do
    to keep from bursting right there as he was, merely trying to hurry down the hall.<br>
    <br>
    Finally he reached the end of the corridor near the landing. He pressed his legs together
    again. Thankfully, there was nobody immediately about. He stepped toward the edge of the
    landing and listened to the sounds of the crowd below, his bladder screaming at him to let
    go. He could hear the noise of the party and conversation quite clearly. Looking down, he
    could even see shadows.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ohh...&quot; he groaned quietly in his misery. There were people everywhere! His
    bladder swelled still further and pinched at him mercilessly in protest. He shushed it. He
    told himself that the bladder was a muscular organ and would therefore expand to contain
    whatever volume there was inside it. All he had to do was will it to stay closed. That was
    all. After all, he was a strong, handsome gentleman of property in the prime of his life.
    He could surely hold it however long he had to, no matter how... thundering the need.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, he had to go so badly! Now- he tried to take a deep breath, upstairs to search more
    rooms, or maybe- downstairs and out the door, probably having to evade others? He really
    didn't know at that moment which prospect seemed more promising. He found it difficult to
    keep a single thought in mind. All he could think about was how terribly he needed to
    urinate. He'd been holding it for so long! He bent at the waist, his hand trembling on the
    banister, in a cold sweat.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ohhhh, God please make it stop...&quot; he whispered, and closed his eyes for a
    moment, his body trying not to contort itself too ridiculously. His bladder, still
    thrashing madly with his need, sent him a particularly hot, sharp twinge; so strong and so
    urgent he was unable to his hand from burying itself again between his thighs. Oh, dear
    God, where are all the toilets in this bloody house?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ohhhh...&quot; he moaned softly. Oh, this is so silly, he thought. &quot;I have to
    relieve myself. I simply HAVE to. What if I... just cannot wait any longer? It's not my
    fault Bish Manor doesn't have proper facilities... at least any that I can find. Oh, just
    please make it stop...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He didn't dare move for several seconds. He stood, the white noise of desperation filling
    his head, his knees almost numb from being held so tense. Finally the rush of pressure
    edged off just enough, and he was again able to stand more or less upright. Just hold it a
    little longer, he told himself. Just try and make it... well, he decided then to try and
    venture UP the stairs. There were fewer of them, for one thing, and it was more private
    although there was no greater promise of possible proper relief. He crossed the short
    hallway, his great need weighing him down with every careful step. I don't know how much
    longer I can take this; I really don't, he thought, his agony reaching a fevered level.
    It's beyond uncomfortable; it badly HURTS for goodness sake... I'm so damned full, it's
    simply impossible, I can't, I really... his thoughts trailed off as he reached the first
    step on the landing. His bladder trembled, threatening him. It was the worst state of
    desperation he could remember in all his years as a gentleman.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm not going to make it!&quot; he said out loud suddenly. He turned back to the
    hall behind him. His bladder was dying. It was more, now, apparently, than posh, polite
    Reginald could stand. He took only a few more mincing, contorted steps, as far as the
    first door, (one of the few he'd thought to close), when suddenly his bladder quivered
    with sick violence, and to his horror and humiliation, he felt a hot, thin slash of urine
    escape the tip of his penis and soak, warm, into the fabric of his underwear and formal
    gray pinstripe trousers. He let out a cry and his hands, both of them, darted to his fly,
    scrambling madly to undo the buttons. It was too late. He couldn't help it. He was wetting
    his pants. He struggled, still wrestling with his buttons, he struggled to stop himself,
    and with a good deal of painful clenching and contorting, was just able to stem the
    ferocious oncoming deluge, issuing only threatening threads and dribbles down his legs and
    into his clothes.<br>
    <br>
    Immediately he ducked into the first room opposite, its door still open from before. He
    scuffled into the dark, both hands tearing at the front of his pants. His bladder throbbed
    tyrannically, and before he was even fully into the shadows, he began to void even more
    strongly. &quot;Oh, god, please no, not here, not here...!&quot; He whispered, his voice
    piteous and sincerely plaintive, feeling himself on the very verge of breaking utterly and
    completely.<br>
    <br>
    He just had to get his pants open; already he could feel an alarming amount of wetness and
    warmth between his legs, trickling down the insides of his thighs. He was wetting, most
    certainly, but not yet in full force by any means. He fought to control the complete
    spill, dying from shame, and by the time he was finally able to free his spurting,
    exhausted penis, he was in tears.<br>
    <br>
    Immediately he took hold of the head of the soft, wet thing between his thumb and
    forefinger and squeezed it shut tight. A large amber drop pooled at the tip of the glans
    and then fell. Reginald tried to catch his breath. He was trembling all over, crying from
    how badly it hurt. He didn't dare let go of himself. He crouched forward in an agonized
    curtsey, his bladder screeching and weakening rapidly. He looked with frantic,
    tear-stained eyes around the strange room for anything he could possibly use for a
    receptacle.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mmmmmnn...!&quot; he cried softly, alone in the room, now not only clamping off
    around the shaft of his member just behind the head, but pinching the flesh of the slit at
    the tip closed as well with his other hand. He hopped a little, biting his lip, his lovely
    English face desperate and shifted his weight around like mad, his wet pants open at the
    fly. There were only a few drops on the floor beneath him, not at all the massive puddle
    he wanted so desperately to avoid. &quot;Oh, dear GOD, I have to peeeee!&quot; he whined.<br>
    <br>
    He crossed his legs, fought another wicked, needful surge and kept his fingers closed
    tight around his quivering penis in both places. He saw nothing in the room but tables,
    chairs, and books. Obviously it was a library. He took a few comically hunched tiptoed
    steps over toward the other side of the room, peering into the corners, hoping against
    hope for the sight of a wastebasket. Nothing. He bobbed up and down, made cringing, little
    sobbing noises. He had never in all his life as a gentleman been so embarrassed.<br>
    <br>
    I don't know what I'm going to do, he thought, I just can't hold it in anymore, oh God,
    I'm going to wet on the floor... he squirmed. &quot;I'm going to wet on the floor!&quot;
    His bladder shrieked in frenzy and felt as if the stone it were made of was beginning to
    crack. He felt another rush then, so strong and so overwhelming his muscles quite forgot
    their task, and despite all his efforts, all his contortions and childlike squeezing, a
    long, hot stream managed to escape.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, god, I can't hold it! Another warm splash pulsed forward and fell to the floor with a
    splattering sound. He wrenched himself tightly, but it was simply no use. He was bursting,
    completely. He scurried like an animal into the closest corner leaving a trail of
    long-held urine underfoot, swearing and finally peeing so thunderously and furiously he
    was almost unable to bring himself to a full stance there up against the corner wall. He
    could not stop. The urine came in hard, pouring waves, fast, pounding, making an
    embarrassingly loud, un-ignorable hiss. He gasped aloud, his eyes fluttering, faint with
    the rapidly building landscape of relief. He felt it come, so heavy and so complete, all
    that fullness and all that water, so heavy...<br>
    <br>
    He moaned and tried his best for a clear aim at the floor, and he realized with terrible
    shame that he had truly and finally lost his most private battle. It was all he could do
    to stand there, his legs trembling, and watch helplessly as hours of waiting and suffering
    and torture came at last to a gorgeous end. The puddle grew quickly, pooling hot around on
    the hard wooden edges of the polished floor before finally seeping into the large oriental
    carpet. The red nap of the fabric turned dark and glistened. He loathed spoiling it, but
    there was nothing to be done. Soaking the floor had turned out to be an inevitability.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ohhh, dear God forgive me, I just couldn't wait,&quot; he whispered in all valiant
    modest sincerity. He felt that hateful pinch at the crux of his bladder inside him slowly
    and blessedly begin to disappear. His mind began to turn a cool blue. Oh, he'd had to go
    SO badly! The relief was nothing short of orgasmic. After well over a minute, he felt the
    stream begin to subside and he looked down. The floor was covered with it, practically
    steaming around his resplendent black patent leather shoes. It was still coming. Wary,
    suddenly, of possible (horror!) discovery, he cast a quick, anguished glance over his
    shoulder to the direction of the door, and realized then that he had neglected in his
    haste to close it behind him.<br>
    <br>
    He hurried to finish up. &quot;Come on, Reginald...get to the last of it...&quot; After a
    few more slashes and dribbles he finally felt sufficiently empty, and so much better he
    could have slept for a quarter century. With no reason whatsoever to hesitate, he buttoned
    himself back up and stepped back, wiping the tears from his handsome face, to the open
    door. He inspected the front of his pants in the light of the hallway.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, dear...&quot; Well, it wasn't too bad, he decided. It could have been worse. He
    would be dry in ten minutes time, he supposed, and resolved until then to keep more or
    less out of sight.<br>
    <br>
    Reginald then stepped into the hallway, closed the door behind him, smoothed his slick,
    dark hair, tugged at his vest to pretty his silhouette, and headed for the stairs.<br>
    <br>
    He could really use a drink.<br>
