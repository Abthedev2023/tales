    Wonder Woman</strong></font><font FACE="Arial"><p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">(Based
    on my very first watersports fantasy)</font><b></p>
    </b><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though she&#146;d never convince anyone else of it, it was
    often difficult being the most powerful woman in the world. Certainly, being a
    superheroine had its moments. You got to stomp on the occasional arch-criminal, you never
    aged so you always looked stunning, you were adored by millions of fans, especially
    undersexed boys, and you could always stride around confident in the knowledge that you
    could do things that no one else in the world could do.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But there were drawbacks, things you couldn&#146;t let the
    public know about or they might tarnish your heroic image. Keeping a secret identity was
    always the worst, because leading a double life can sap anyone&#146;s strength, but there
    was also the hassle of finding parts for your supervehicle without leaving a paper trail,
    or finding just the right material for your costume. And now some criminals were suing
    their captors for &quot;superhero brutality&quot;&#151;and winning!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But for Wonder Woman, the tall, sexy, superpowered Amazon,
    the biggest drawback to being a superheroine was the way her body was designed. Though it
    was superhuman in strength and proportion, it was still human, which meant she had normal
    human needs, wants, and weaknesses. Mainly, every muscle in her body worked like every
    muscle in a normal woman&#146;s body, only in an enhanced fashion. That meant her heart
    worked harder, her arms lifted more, her legs carried her farther, faster. It also meant
    that other, less thought about muscles worked harder as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus the problem. One of those lesser known muscles was her
    bladder. Like her heart, it worked harder at it&#146;s job, in the case that it could hold
    much more urine than the average woman&#146;s. The problem was it couldn&#146;t hold it
    for much longer than the average woman, and Wonder Woman tended to forget that when she
    drank, always assuming that her bladder would hold until she got to a toilet, or found
    someplace to relieve herself. She didn&#146;t consider how high stress her main occupation
    was, nor that it often called her to duty when she needed to pee the most. And while her
    bladder worked twice as hard to hold her pee, it also worked twice as hard to expel it
    when it could last no longer. Once, after battling a giant ape to a standstill, she&#146;d
    had to pee so bad that she flew into the window of a nearby car and flooded the floor with
    a puddle of urine an inch deep. She begged the nearby reporters and police not to let it
    go public, but the blue fabric that covered her crotch dripped with piss, and the fact
    that the white stars had turned a shiny yellow made it pretty clear what her problem was
    to any observant person. She&#146;d seen nothing of it in the papers though, and was glad
    it hadn&#146;t turned into an event, but from that moment on, she tried to be more careful
    about her liquid intake, and visited any available rest room in her civilian identity as
    often as she could.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sometime later, she was invited to a special event in the
    city. The most prominent women in the state were there, honoring those women who had made
    a positive impact on city life. Wonder Woman was the most famous honoree, and upon
    arriving was set upon by the crowd. They peppered her with questions and compliments as
    they plied her with wine. Wonder Woman took the drinks to be polite, making the usual
    assumptions about her body&#146;s stamina. <i>It takes a lot of drinks to make me drunk</i>,
    she thought, <i>and they&#146;re only small glasses. I think my bladder will make it.
    It&#146;s been so quiet in the city lately. I&#146;ll be able to just go home and pee</i>.
    She wouldn&#146;t think of visiting the Ladies&#146; room in the convention center. Too
    many people to see such a weakness. If she had to pee, she would simply have to wait until
    she got home. It was an easy decision to make at the beginning of the event, and after
    only two drinks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a different story hours later. There were
    preliminary speeches to be made, then a toast for each honoree, followed by a plaque
    presentation and a speech. Wonder Woman knew she would be last, and there were so many
    others before her, and as each was introduced, then toasted, then given the plaque, then
    spoke, the Amazon felt her bladder fill, more and more. She looked out in the audience
    from the dais, watching as many of the women excused themselves to the bathroom. She
    wished she could bring herself to join them, but she was so concerned with her image she
    merely crossed her legs and prayed to Poseiden to keep the waters that filled her inside
    her until she could let them go in private.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When there were three women to go before her, Wonder
    Woman&#146;s bladder had reached its capacity. Her legs were crossed hard around her
    star-spangled crotch, and while her face was pleasant and passive, her body was in
    turmoil. Her hands gripped her seat hard enough to leave dents. Two to go, and the
    superheroine couldn&#146;t help but fidget in her chair, wiggling her beautiful bottom as
    inconspicuously as possible. One to go, and she pressed her ass into the chair as hard as
    she could without breaking it, squeezing her pussy between the cushion and her thighs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally she was introduced, and she was struck by a sudden
    panic. What if she peed herself as she stood? Or as she made her speech? What could she
    do? Suddenly it was too late to consider such things as she had to stand and receive her
    plaque. Standing upright was the hardest movement she had ever made, so desperate was she
    not to pee in her costume. She stood like a model, one leg crossed in front of the other,
    surreptitiously squeezing her thighs around her cunt as she smiled and held up the plaque
    for pictures, then for the amount of time it took to make her speech.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though the event was over, she was in agony as she was
    crowded on the way out as much as she was on the way in. Finally she made it outside, but
    reporters and fans made it impossible for her to fly off immediately, and Gods did she
    need to fly off! Her beautiful legs jiggled uncontrollably when standing cross-legged no
    longer worked, and her answers to the questions shouted at her from the crowd were short
    and terse. Ultimately she had to hold the plaque in front of her crotch, allowing her to
    squeeze her bladder with her free hand. Finally she made an excuse to go and leaped into
    the night sky.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Flying is harder to do than it looks to an average person,
    and with a full bladder it was nearly impossible. The speed and drag made the fluid weigh
    all the more, and she found that she had to cross her legs and hold her crotch in mid-air,
    making it impossible to fly a straight path. Soon she gave up and descended onto the
    nearest high-rise roof.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once grounded, Wonder Woman was totally immobilized. The
    plaque was thrown to the roof as she clasped both hands around her pussy and twisted her
    legs together, squeezing and crunching them all together. Her ass jiggled and bounced,
    shaking her fabulous tits as they rose and fell with her heavy breaths. She whimpered and
    sobbed as she wondered what the hell she was going to do. It seemed she had no choice but
    to urinate on the roof.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her costume was slight, but its style made it difficult to
    remove. It was centered on the belt, which was made of gold and didn&#146;t stretch.
    Molded to her waist, it had to be removed before anything else could be taken off. She
    tried, but she couldn&#146;t unclasp it with one hand, and the other was busy grinding her
    peehole. The fabric of the star-spangled crotch was too tight for her to just move it
    aside, and she&#146;d still wet it with as much as she was holding. It looked as if she
    would have to just rip it apart and repair it later.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wonder Woman&#146;s predicament was not as secret as
    she&#146;d hoped. She was being watched from far away. The evil witch-goddess Circe was
    watching her wiggle and squirm through a crystal ball, and decided to add to the
    hero&#146;s problems. With a spell and a gesture, Wonder Woman disappeared from the roof.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Amazon found herself trapped in a small, bare room, lit
    from above. Before she could get her bearings, two of the walls started closing in on her.
    She looked on in horror as they got closer and closer. She could probably hold them back,
    but not while she was locked in this struggle with her bladder. Soon she had no choice
    and, keeping her legs crossed tight, stretched out her powerful arms to hold back the
    walls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she struggled with the walls her ass bounced and shook
    more erratically, and soon she could feel urine escape into her urethra. It was coming
    out, and for Wonder Woman it wouldn&#146;t start with just a couple of spurts. Her bladder
    would push it all out in a huge rush.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At last, her bladder could take no more. She felt her piss
    gush through her like water through a high-pressure hose, then her crotch and ass were
    surrounded by a liquid heat as she flooded her pants in a split second. The rush continued
    out, sliding down her legs like a storm tide. Her piss cascaded to the floor, sounding
    like a hard rain shower on impact. The puddle she was causing grew wider and wider, some
    of it seeping under the moving walls.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wonder Woman wiggled in vain until she was about half
    empty, then sighed with relief as she opened her legs and just finished. The piss ran out
    of her like wine from an upturned jug, and it was long minutes before she finally dried
    up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She took stock of herself. Her legs and ass glistened with
    the sheen of pee, while the crotch of her costumed was immediately riding up between her
    cheeks. She could feel wet fabric up to her waist, and the puddle had taken up all the
    floor that was left in the still shrinking room. A sudden anger gave her an extra spurt of
    strength, and with a growl she broke the walls apart and leaped through the ceiling.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She found herself in Circe&#146;s antechamber. The witch
    was laying on cushions in one corner of the opulently decorated hall. Wonder Woman began
    to stride purposefully toward her, but the woman jumped up and ran toward the hero,
    shouting, &quot;I surrender! I surrender!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wonder Woman crossed her arms and glared at Circe.
    &quot;Oh, really?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Circe stopped right in front of the Amazon and looked her
    up and down, beaming. &quot;I saw everything!&quot; She exclaimed. &quot;Oh, by Zeus it
    was beautiful! You&#146;re beautiful!&quot; Every now and then Circe&#146;s gaze drifted
    to the dripping star-studded blue field of Wonder Woman&#146;s crotch, and she sucked in
    breath through her grin. &quot;So, I surrender, if only you&#146;ll grant me one
    request!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wonder Woman pondered the strange, eager look on
    Circe&#146;s face. &quot;What would that be?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Moments later, Wonder Woman was out of her soaked costume,
    laying on Circe&#146;s cushions as the witch ate her pussy, the powerful muscles of which
    grabbed and grabbed at Circe&#146;s tongue. The Amazon&#146;s legs scissored around
    Circe&#146;s head as she came closer and closer to orgasm. As she felt it coming, she also
    felt her bladder filling again, and just as she was lost in the spasms of ecstasy, she
    thought: <i>This may turn out to be an even closer trap than that room. I&#146;ll never
    make it home if she doesn&#146;t have a bathroom...!</font><font FACE="Arial"><br>
