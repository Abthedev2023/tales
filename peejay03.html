    <br>
    Debbie was walking along the country lane when the need to pee started. The urge had come
    upon her quite suddenly. No gradual feeling of fullness in her bladder, she seemed to go
    from not wanting to pee to being bloody desperate in a matter of minutes.<br>
    <br>
    This was not good. All she had on either side of her were tall hedges. Occasionally there
    was a gate that led to a field, but now that she wanted one there wasn't a gate to be
    seen. As she walked, so the feeling in her bladder became more acute. It was obvious to
    her that unless she could get into a field pretty soon she was going to have to empty her
    bladder on the path.<br>
    <br>
    The trouble with that was that the lane was pretty twisty which meant that anyone could
    come around a corner at any moment. The thought that someone would stumble on her
    squatting and having a pee wasn't worth thinking about.<br>
    <br>
    Now walking was becoming distinctly awkward and a dull pain had started in her belly.
    Desperately, Debbie rounded each corner in the hope that there would be a gate or some
    break in the line of hedgerows that she could nip into and get that little bit of privacy
    that she needed. But as each corner was rounded so her desperation grew, as the hedges
    remained horribly unbroken.<br>
    <br>
    She stopped and let a little squirt into her knickers. She was wearing white slacks, a
    blue blouse and sandals. The squirt relieved a little bit of the immediate pressure, but
    she realized it wouldn't be enough. Luckily there was barely a sign of the wetness on her
    slacks, though she felt the little trickle of warm pee start down the inside of her
    thighs.<br>
    <br>
    Another corner was rounded and then about 100 yards ahead she saw a gate. She moved as
    quickly as she dared, each desperate step threatening to unload the contents of her
    bladder into her underwear. But as she neared the gate she saw to her horror that the top
    of it was covered in vicious looking barbed wire. With sinking heart Debbie realized that
    there was no way that she was going to climb over the gate without doing her clothes and
    worse, herself, serious damage.<br>
    <br>
    Well that's it, she realized. Now she had no choice in the matter. She'd have to take the
    chance that no one would come around one of the bends and run into her relieving herself.
    Hell the odds were on her side. She'd not seen anyone in the half hour she'd been walking
    so far. It wasn't often she envied men, but when it came to getting caught short they were
    at an advantage. They could just whip out their dicks and pee where they stood, and best
    of all cover up quickly in an emergency. Debbie began to unbutton the slacks and was about
    to pull them down along with her tights and knickers when she heard the ringing of a
    bicycle bell from around the bend ahead of her.<br>
    <br>
    She froze as a group of some 20 or so cyclists came around the corner like refugees from
    the Tour De France. As they passed Debbie they made some comments and gave her looks that
    suggested they were impressed with her. Had they not been ringing their bells they'd have
    been a lot more impressed seeing her with her slacks around her knees! As they passed so
    Debbie valiantly hung on to her dignity, but even before they were fully past her she felt
    her resistance giving way. Try as she could she couldn't hold the pee back and more
    dribbled into her knickers. Just when it seemed they'd all passed a final straggler came
    around the bend and in his hurry he hit Debbie. He swerved enough so that the blow was
    glancing rather than full on, but it was enough to knock him off his bike and her into the
    hedge.<br>
    <br>
    However the real damage to Debbie wasn't the few scratches she picked up from the hedge,
    but from the fact the collision also resulted in her finally losing all control of her
    bladder. As soon as she hit the hedge and fell into a sitting position she began wetting
    herself. Unfortunately the shock meant Debbie didn't even realize she was wetting herself
    until her bladder was emptying in full flow. And even then it took another few seconds
    before she really became horribly aware of the wet warmth that was pooling around her bum
    and down the back of her legs. She looked at her crotch to see the white material of her
    slacks darkening. Desperately she tried to stop the flow by shoving her hands over her
    crotch but it was all to no avail. The piss was flowing and that was that. Debbie closed
    her eyes in horror as she felt the piss pooling around her bum in even greater volume. In
    her horror she had forgotten about the cyclist until she became aware of him looming over
    her, concern on his face. Then he noticed the spreading puddle around where she was
    sitting and embarrassment showed on his face.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;OK?&quot; he asked, unable to take his eyes off the sight of Debbie's pee.<br>
    <br>
    She simply nodded and silently screamed for him to get the hell away and leave her to die
    of shame with what little dignity she had left.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sure? I can get some help if...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm fine,&quot; Debbie croaked. &quot;I'll be fine. I'm just a little wet, that's
    all.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He nodded, seemingly relieved that she was willing to leave it at that. He remounted his
    bike and with a final look at Debbie he sped off to join his mates. What a story he would
    have to tell. She just prayed they wouldn't come back this way on some sort of mercy
    mission - or worse, to gawp at her.<br>
    By now the flow from her bladder had ceased, but the damage had been done. With a little
    sob, which was partly pain, mainly humiliation, Debbie gingerly stood. Some piss from her
    crotch dribbled down the front of her slacks, but most of it ran down the backs of her
    legs in a little flood and into her sandals. She gasped as it did so.<br>
    <br>
    She looked down at where she'd been sat. The big wet patch bore testament to her accident.
    She ran her hands over her rear, wincing as she felt the piss soaked material clinging to
    her butt. She then took a few steps and winced again at the feel of her wet slacks
    clinging to her legs. Well the fact was that she had no option but to walk home in this
    state. Desperately she hoped that the warmth of the day would dry the material out enough
    so that her accident wouldn't be too obvious, but she knew it was going to be a long walk
    home in more ways than one. <p>&nbsp;</p>
