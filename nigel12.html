    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria was in trouble. She hadn't
    eaten properly in days and her landlord was closing in fast on her rent arrears. Her last
    earnings had gone on keeping the gas and electric company at bay. Now she was faced with
    the prospect of finding £1000 within the next few days or face the prospect of being
    kicked out onto the street. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Times had been hard. From what
    little she managed to earn during the day as a temporary bar maid at one of the local
    pubs, she occasionally supplemented by taking herself onto the streets at night. She hated
    doing it, but it had become the only way. Twice the police had picked her up but necessity
    drove her to continue.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was late Thursday evening. She
    had just come in after earning a swift twenty quid. The guy had been almost half her age
    and had cum within seconds of slipping his young, inexperienced member inside her. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria ran a bath and while she sat
    on the loo the reached for her money container and forlornly counted her
    &quot;savings&quot; when added to the paltry twenty quid. Undressing, she admired her firm
    slim figure in the mirror before stepping naked into the bath to wash away the disgust of
    what she had been forced to allow herself to do. She was pretty liberal minded and there
    wasn't much she had drawn a line at. The young kid she'd just had was typical. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She had only a few hours now to pay
    her debts. She rolled herself into bed, ignoring the famished pangs of hunger from her
    stomach, and slept until mid morning. As she awoke she made herself a cup of coffee using
    the last dregs from the jar and put on almost the last of her make-up. She had to be at
    the pub by twelve and although it was hopeless she thought she might as well rake in the
    few measly quid she would get. Maybe...just maybe, something would turn up. It was almost
    closing time at half past two when two smart looking city gents walked in. One was in his
    mid fifties while the other was considerably younger, maybe in his thirties. Maria eyed
    her boss who had been about to call time. It had been a particularly slow session so he
    nodded, thinking he may as well take in a few more quid.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria served them. The younger one
    smiled politely and Maria smiled back. They ordered some food and along with a few other
    regulars they took seats and discussed business. Every now and then though, the guy would
    look up at Maria.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Eventually the pub closed and they
    had to leave. Maria was clearing tables and had just found a half empty packet of crisps.
    Her ravenous hunger drove her to finish them off and she looked up embarrassed as the
    younger guy spotted her. She smiled and blushed while he waved her goodbye.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Later that evening Maria was back in
    her flat. She put on her shortest black skirt and a pink vest top and headed out onto the
    street, hoping against hope for one rich city boy to save her from impending doom.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For three hours or more she paced
    around nervously on her usual street corner, keeping one ear and one eye out for police
    cars. It was getting late and she was cold. Her bladder kept telling her she needed to pee
    but she put it down to the chill night air. Suddenly a car drew up slowly. Her initial
    thought, as happened so many times was that whoever it was would just want directions. She
    stooped to the opening passenger window and there in the driving seat was the younger guy
    from earlier. Again she flushed crimson with embarrassment.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't pay you enough then at
    the pub?&quot; He said cheerfully. Maria shook her head nervously, &quot;Hop in,&quot; he
    said. With nothing to lose she joined him. Her short skirt rode up a little as she sat and
    she couldn't help notice the gleam in his eye. Perhaps she could squeeze a few quid out of
    him she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hungry?&quot; He asked. Maria
    nodded dumbly. She couldn't deny it - she was absolutely starving!&nbsp; With barely
    another word he drove off and pulled up moments later in a café car park. Together they
    wandered in and he ordered her a meal and a mug of tea for both of them.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As her food arrived she dug in
    ravenously. Small talk continued which inevitably circled around her second occupation.
    Maria saw no reason in lying and confessed her current predicament.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;And how much would you charge
    if I...?&quot; He said. Maria eyed him up, trying to work out how serious he was if at
    all, and if so how much she thought she might dare ask for, &quot;Fifty&quot; she said
    finally.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Fifty?&quot; He said. He
    pulled out his wallet. He withdrew a wedge of notes, mainly fifties. There must have been
    over a thousand pounds there. Maria's eyes bulged. He took a fifty and handed it to her.
    She took it and stuffed it in her bag without a second thought. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Where do we go for this
    then?&quot; He asked finally. &quot;That's up to you.&quot; Maria replied, returning to
    her meal.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm staying tonight at a hotel
    about three miles away. Any good?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Fine.&quot; Maria replied
    matter of factly.&nbsp; He watched while she polished off her meal and downed her tea.
    Then they got up and he led her back towards the car. Before opening it he paused,
    &quot;There is one thing.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'Oh shit, he wants something
    disgusting!' Maria thought<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I do have rather an unusual
    request.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Go on.&quot; She said, fearing
    the worst.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't want you to pee for as
    long as you possibly can. Can you manage that?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I guess so.&quot; Maria said
    curiously. This was not a request she'd ever had before.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll give you fifty quid for
    every half hour you can last, however I should warn you we will first be stopping off at a
    bar and you must drink whatever I say.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria nodded. Her brain already
    counting the fifties she was about to earn. Even three more hours in his company would
    mean an extra three hundred quid. This was a dream come true, &quot;Easy money!&quot; she
    thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They drove a couple of miles to a
    club. At the entrance hall Maria spotted the loos, &quot;Can I pee now before we start?
    She asked, already feeling a slight need from holding all evening and having that mug of
    tea.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He eyed her up and down, &quot;I
    don't think so.&quot; He concluded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She shrugged her shoulders and they
    went inside. Seating her at a table he went to the bar and returned with two pints of
    lager, one for each of them, and a jug of water. Maria tried to take her time but every
    few minutes he would indicate for her to sup up. Within fifteen minutes her lager had
    disappeared. He poured a pint of water from the jug for her. Another fifteen minutes past
    and that too was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He got up to get her another pint of
    beer. Maria gazed around the club quite happily. She didn't feel any greater need than
    when she'd first come in and smiled to herself at the thought of the fifty quid she'd
    earned just for sitting there. He returned with another pint each. This time he didn't
    hurry her and it was almost forty-five minutes until her glass was empty. Idle talk about
    home, families, work etc had made the time pass, however, as she took her last sip she
    became aware of the first real need to pee. She wasn't desperate yet, but she could feel
    her bladder starting to swell beneath her skirt. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He poured her some more iced water
    and insisted she drank it straight down this time. She complied as best she could and as
    soon as that was gone he was up again to the bar. While he was there Maria pressed a hand
    towards her crotch. She felt pretty full and for the first time began to wonder just how
    long she could hold off from peeing. He returned and she smiled as he handed her a fifth
    pint of liquid since coming in. She crossed her legs and took a small sip.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Again he didn't hurry her and by the
    time she finished another hour had passed and she had to admit to herself that she was now
    desperate for the loo.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; He
    asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Fine.&quot; She replied,
    smiling back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Liar!&quot; He said smugly<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Okay, I need to go!&quot; She
    confessed, pressing both hands down towards her lap in 'mock' desperation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I should think so.&quot; He
    said. He reached in his pocket and withdrew three hundred quid. He handed it to her,
    &quot;You can take this and leave now if you wish.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria stared at the money and took
    it before he changed his mind. She was desperate to pee but felt able to go on a bit
    further, &quot;I can last a bit longer if you wish!&quot; She said smiling cheekily.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He gazed at her, &quot;Are you
    sure?&quot; She nodded, &quot;If I ask you to go on I want your assurance now that you
    will not pee for at least another hour. Do we have a deal?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria glanced at her watch. She
    already wanted to plunge a hand against her pee-hole, but she wasn't experiencing 'too'
    much discomfort. She hesitated though. If she had to keep drinking at this rate she'd be
    totally bursting within the hour.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He could see her indecision and
    reached again for his wallet, &quot;Another three hundred if you make it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria could hardly afford to refuse,
    &quot;I can't drink any more though.&quot; She said finally.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Just one more pint and that
    will be it, I promise.&quot; He said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria hesitated again,
    &quot;Okay!&quot; She said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Without pausing he reached for her
    empty glass and returned shortly with another pint, &quot;Drink it quickly, it's time we
    went back to my room.&quot; She did as she was told, finishing it within ten minutes. Then
    they were up and heading to his hotel. The journey was awful. As soon as she stood her
    need to pee increased alarmingly. Waiting for the taxi outside the club was almost more
    than she could bear and she was literally hopping from one foot to the other as it drew up
    and making occasional grabs at herself through her skirt. He stood next to her, leering
    and enjoying every moment of her agony.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a mighty relief when the taxi
    came and she could take a seat in the back. Her skirt rose up as she crossed her legs and
    the pressure inside her tormented bladder was excruciating. She was dying to let some out,
    yet what would he say if she did? Besides she hadn't wet herself since she was six and
    didn't want to start now. Also there was the tantalizing three hundred extra quid waiting
    for her if she could last. Grimly she clenched herself shut and smiled at him as he took a
    seat next to her. He leaned over and gave instructions to the driver. Maria was barely
    listening as it was taking all her concentration now not to leak. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As they set off she gazed out of the
    window. After a while he reached a hand discretely to her abdomen and she turned as she
    felt his hand press lightly against the aching bulge of her bursting bladder. 'Just endure
    it until we get to the room!' she told herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The drive seemed to take an age. She
    was certain he had said it was only a few blocks. Ten minutes later it dawned on her that
    he was prolonging her agony still further. The driver was going round in circles! Without
    saying anything she grimly held on and prayed it wouldn't be too much longer. That extra
    three hundred would keep her fed and warm for months, what was another few minutes
    discomfort, even if she'd have given almost anything to be locked in a cubicle on her own
    at that moment.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">More agonizing minutes passed until
    finally the taxi pulled up outside his hotel. At least she began to hope it was over. If
    she had to walk far she would die, her bladder was extremely full and the pressure on her
    sphincter was almost more than she could stand. She struggled out and stood painfully
    while he paid the driver. Then he steered her into the hotel lobby and into a lift. She
    was almost crying as she stood in the corner, watching the lights of each floor light up.
    She was trying not to hold herself but eventually couldn't stand it any long and plunged a
    hand beneath her skirt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Nearly there.&quot; He said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I hope so!&quot; She cried,
    &quot;I'm almost doing it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At last the lift stopped on floor
    nineteen. He led her almost bent double now, down the corridor and stopped outside his
    door,<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh God, Please let me pee!
    Please let me pee! Please let me pee!&quot; She screeched, frantically hopping up and down
    and dipping one leg hard into the other.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Inside Maria immediately caught site
    of the bathroom to her left. Her bladder felt like a bowling ball and she begged him to
    let her go. Instead he guided her towards the bed where she sat thighs squeezed together
    and both hands at her sides squeezing the duvet. He looked at his watch. She still had a
    little more than twenty minutes to wait until her hour was up. He told her that she was to
    do whatever it took now to hold on. Meanwhile he positioned himself on the bed and sat
    back to watch. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria sat there a while not knowing
    what to do. Before long she was fidgeting again and eventually she stood and paced up and
    down the room, pretending to look at various things. All of a sudden she had to do deep
    curtseys almost constantly and it soon became apparent that she would need more than just
    her own muscle power to hold the huge amount of liquid she had taken on board. She sat
    again on the bed, gently squeezing herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He moved towards her and kissed her
    neck. She gasped at the unexpected pleasure this brought her. He slipped a hand to her
    breasts and she realized with some surprise that her nipples were already hard and erect.
    Her head leaned back and their lips met. Maria parted her legs and allowed one of his
    hands to press firmly against her crotch to hold back her wee. She was bursting to go, but
    now she realized she was also extremely aroused by the situation. She let him unbutton her
    top and unclip her bra, both her hands now wedged firmly between her legs as the urge to
    pee became even more excruciating. Her firm breasts free, his hands explored every inch,
    making her tingle with pleasure.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then his hands moved further down,
    forcing her own away from her crotch and replacing them again with one of his own. She
    moaned as the urge to pee almost overwhelmed her. She screamed she was about to pee and he
    plunged his hand even firmer against her so she couldn't. Her bladder was bursting, her
    mind in a whirl as she thrust herself against his hand, desperate for the situation to
    continue but also agonizingly desperate to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Somehow she maintained control and
    he eased his hand away and removed both her skirt and panties until she was naked there
    before him. Maria was in total torment, she was absolutely frantic to pee yet completely
    unable to stop herself from lying back and allowing this man to have his way with her.
    Before she knew it he was leaning naked over her, the agonizing bulge of her bladder
    almost breaking under the strain as he parted her thighs and entered her. She could feel
    every inch grazing against her bladder. She clenched her sphincter shut with all her might
    and just lay back, eyes closed as he pounded inside her until she heard him grunt in
    triumph as he came.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She must have lain there for several
    more minutes afterwards, an orgasm of her own sweeping torturously through her very being.
    When she awoke he was collapsed on top of her. The pain in her bladder was almost too much
    to bear. She struggled out from under him and shuffled uncomfortably to the loo. About to
    squat for the pee she'd been deprived of for so long, he appeared suddenly at the doorway.
    In absolute terror he'd make her wait longer, she literally begged him to allow her to go
    before he could even open his mouth. He stood there grinning back as she stood in half
    squat over the loo, feeling a burst of pee, so huge, right on the brink of entering her
    urethra. She could barely contain it!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You can pee now.&quot; He
    finally announced.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maria almost fainted with relief as
    she sank onto the loo. At last she relaxed and gasped out loud as the first clear trickle
    of her pent up piss finally broke free.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
