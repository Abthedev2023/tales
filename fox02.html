    color="#000000">And Now, This Message...</font></em></p>
    <p><em><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">(An advertisement we&#146;d all love to
    see)</font></em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was nearly impossible to drive with one
    hand on the wheel and one foot slammed down on the gas, but Brooke had no choice. Her
    other limbs were occupied. Her other hand was buried between her thighs, pressing and
    squeezing tight the mound of her puss through the sweaty spandex of her bike shorts. Her
    shapely, free leg was wrapped around the working one, and her thighs ground together hard.
    Her pert boobs rose and fell in her baby T-shirt as she breathed heavily through her
    teeth, every so often emitting a tortured moan or sob through her luscious lips. She was
    so lucky she hadn&#146;t yet been stopped for speeding, as she was tearing through the
    nighttime city streets like a bat out of hell, frantic to get to a toilet. It seemed like
    it had taken forever to reach her apartment building, and when she turned in to the
    entrance she had to stop at the barricade as always. She knew the guard running the gate
    would take time to ogle her cleavage and model&#146;s face through the security-cam before
    letting her in, and she took the opportunity to free her driving hand to help its partner
    for a moment. As she waited, she muttered through her clenched teeth: &quot;Stupid sports
    drinks!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Brooke&#146;s long red hair trailed behind
    her as she trotted as fast as her baby steps and clenched thighs allowed. The gym bag on
    her shoulder was awkward and weighed her down, but she couldn&#146;t adjust it because she
    was squeezing herself with both hands. She almost lost control when she had to free a hand
    to tap frenziedly on the elevator button, and she had to wriggle and jiggle her shapely
    ass until the elevator door finally opened. As she fell in, squirming and shifting her
    feet, she said a silent prayer that she would make it to her floor without any delays,
    then muttered: &quot;Stupid long workout!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The elevator made three stops before it
    reached her floor, treating new passengers to the show of her desperation. She
    couldn&#146;t have hidden it if she tried. The run to her apartment was brutal, and she
    danced her own, futile Riverdance as she fumbled with her keys and whined: &quot;Stupid,
    cruddy, gym bathrooms!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Brooke was almost crying as her objective
    came ever closer. She didn&#146;t bother to close the front door behind her. She had no
    time. She felt the heat and flow of urine in her urethra as she tossed her bag on a chair
    in the living room and ran into the bedroom and to the bathroom within. She raced to the
    door and grabbed the knob, realizing only with a painful impact that the door was locked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Nonononono!&quot; She moaned as she
    pounded on the door. &quot;Kathy! Oh God, Kathy, you gotta get out of there! I&#146;m
    gonna piss myself! I&#146;ve been holding it forever! Kathy? Are you all right in there?
    You gotta hurry up! I can&#146;t hold it anymore!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She squealed as a sudden gush of warm piss
    flowed out of her. Her crotch became saturated as the flow forced itself through the
    fabric and Brooke&#146;s hand, scattering and dropping to the carpet with a soft,
    sprinkling sound. It tapered off, but didn&#146;t stop, and it would be seconds before the
    rest came out in a flood.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Oh, man...Oh man, I&#146;m pissing!!
    Kathy!! Damn it, get out of there!! I have to go!! Are you hearing me?! Please, Kathy, its
    coming out!!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">In the bathroom, in a warm, sudsy bath,
    Kathy shifted her leg to give her hand more room as it lightly caressed her pussy. She
    listened with a smile on her face as her gorgeous roommate detailed the account of her
    latest accident. With a mischievous look in her eye she slowly raised a sweet candy bar to
    her lips, took a big bite and chewed ever so slowly, savoring every moment of the taste
    sensation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Cue the announcer: <i>Not going anywhere
    for a while?</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Kathy, you bitch!! It&#146;s running
    down my legs!!&quot;</font></p>
