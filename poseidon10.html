     A
     Deliberate 
      Accident<br>
    </strong>
    </font><br><br>Let me begin by saying that I don't make a habit of 
      wetting myself, certainly not deliberately as I did last Sunday. Like 
      most women I've had the occasional major accident (and since having 
      children plenty of experience of those embarrassing little leaks Tena lady 
      can be a saviour at times!). However, apart from a couple of drunken 
      accidents at University when I wet myself on the way back to halls 
      anything more than damp knickers has been rare, though not unheard of, 
      as I have occasionally left it rather late and wet my knickers sat on 
      the loo when I couldn't get them down in time.<br><br>However, back to last Sunday. My husband and I had 
      gone to the local pub for a snack and drink prior to going for a walk 
      on the moors above the village. I did drink a couple of pints of lager 
      and took the precaution of using the loo before we left. We would only be 
      an hour anyway and I ought to have been fine.<br><br>Our stroll took us up to a stream and waterfall with 
      views across the valley where we would usually sit for a bit before 
      making our way back. On this occasion my husband had taken his new 
      camera with him and decided to spend ages setting up a tripod and 
      taking pictures. Whether it was the lager or the sound of rushing 
      water I don't know, but I began to feel the need for a toilet. I 
      continued to sit in the sunshine reading my book while hubby played 
      with his new toy until I looked at my watch and realized that we had 
      been out almost two hours. Not only that, but when I stood up I 
      realized that I now needed the loo rather badly.<br><br>I told hubby I needed a wee and he just said to go 
      in the bushes. There was some cover but although I could have gone 
      into the bracken there were other people about and it would have been 
      obvious what I was doing. Husband insisted he needed another few shots 
      so I decided the best course was to head home on my own - its only about 
      20 minutes - and hope I could find somewhere to go on the way. I knew 
      some possible spots but only if no-one was about.<br><br>A quick but careful walk took me down the hill 
      towards a wall and I was about to squat down beside it when I realized 
      people were coming up the path towards the stile with others further 
      behind them. There was nothing for it but to keep going. I reached the 
      stile, like a step-ladder each side of the wall, and began to climb 
      over. As I put my leg over the top it happened - a spurt of wee 
      escaped then another as I climbed down the other side. It took me 
      completely by surprise for I must have been more desperate than I 
      thought.<br><br>I stopped and squeezed my legs together, managing to 
      regain control but realizing that the gusset of my cotton knickers was 
      soaked though fortunately my summer skirt was still dry. But what to 
      do now? With people on the path ahead of me I didn't want to walk on in 
      case I had a complete accident in front of them. It was embarrassing 
      enough knowing that I'd wet myself but at least so far it was only me 
      that knew. Looking round I saw a rock outcrop a few metres off the 
      path and went to sit on it while I composed myself and let the other 
      pass by while I sat, skirt pulled back, admiring the scenery and praying 
      they would not stop and talk.<br><br>Fortunately they went on their way and I sat there 
      with my mind racing. I didn't think I would make it home without a 
      major accident and being seen in the village with a wet skirt would be 
      just too embarrassing. Then a thought struck me - my knickers were 
      already wet and there was reasonable privacy if I faced away from the 
      path. So why not get it over with and just do it in my pants where I 
      sat. My skirt would stay dry and only I would know what I'd done.<br><br>With that I moved my bum to the edge of the rock, 
      made sure my skirt was clear and just let go. A hot flood poured into 
      my knickers, leaving a wet trail down the rock and a puddle beneath my 
      feet. I could feel my face flush with embarrassment at what I was 
      doing. Here I was, a normal 44 year old woman and I had just 
      deliberately and totally wet my knickers in public. But oh the relief 
      and the feeling of hot wee flooding my pants was not at all 
      unpleasant. I also felt incredibly naughty doing it like this.<br><br>I sat there for a couple of minutes, savouring the 
      relief and wondering what to do next, squeezing my legs together to 
      wring some of the wetness from my pants. Looking round to check no one 
      was about I put my hand up my skirt and squeezed the last drops from 
      my soggy gusset. The result was electric and I came immediately! I sat 
      there shaking from a mix of excitement and horror for several minutes 
      until the sound of a dog barking brought me back to reality.<br><br>I looked round just as my husband climbed over the 
      stile. Quickly I got up and went over to meet him, hoping that I did 
      not look too flushed and that my 'wet knickers walk' did not give me 
      away. As we walked he asked whether I had been able to sort myself out. I 
      mumbled that I couldn't find any cover but that I was alright now. My 
      voice must have given me away because he smiled at me and said, "You 
      silly girl, you've wet yourself haven't you?" I nodded, flushing red 
      again as he glanced round and then slipped his hand up my skirt and 
      fondled by wet bum. I almost came again on the spot as I brushed my 
      hand over the huge erection in his trousers.<br><br>Let's just say that it was a good job we had the 
      house to ourselves when we got home!<br><br>
