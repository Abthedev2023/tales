    <br>
    Vickie left her family's residence and her boyfriend in Philadelphia around 11:00 PM on
    Sunday. She was in route to Virginia Beach and she traveled down the eastern shore to get
    there. Traveling that late at night does not afford one a sufficient number of rest stops,
    and it was a very long drive. Vickie (a city girl) was still reluctant to bare her bottom
    to relieve herself even if she was to be covered by dense woodlands. As a matter of fact
    the denser the woods the more reluctant she was.<br>
    <br>
    So, she was determined to make the entire six-hour trip without a bathroom break. She had
    never driven this far before so she wasn't quite sure what she was getting into. However,
    when she set out she was feeling good and quite confident. She was wearing a charcoal
    flared wool skirt and white blouse with a cardigan sweater. Her outfit was designed
    specifically for comfort during a long drive in what could turn out to be slightly chilly
    weather.<br>
    <br>
    The first couple of hours went well and as she found herself deep into the state of
    Delaware she began to notice the lack of lights and a beginning urge to pee. She was to
    find out that in the wee hours of the morning Delaware and Maryland hadn't much to offer
    by way of rest stops. Neither did Virginia, but Virginia offered some hope in the fact
    that the south island tunnel ramp of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel had an all night
    restaurant- another couple of hours but a definite place to look forward to.<br>
    <br>
    For a while, Vickie was so proud of herself for taking on this long drive and at how well
    she was doing. Her navigation was flawless and she never missed a turn. And, she handled
    herself well in the megalopolis traffic of Philly and Wilmington. But by the time she
    reached Salisbury, Maryland she was squirming and fidgeting in her confining seat behind
    the wheel. She was, at least, grateful for the lack of traffic signals, as she had gone
    through this before in heavy city traffic. She knew that if she could just remain in
    motion she could make it.<br>
    <br>
    She was also thinking what a great job of dressing she had done- nothing too tight, nor
    restricting. Worse comes to worse she thought, I could always just get out and stand
    beside the car and let go without getting my skirt wet. But, that will be a last ditch
    choice. As she approached the north end of the bridge tunnel she knew she had a choice to
    make and she was very desperate. It was breaking day and that was the only light. Only the
    sun was lighting that morning of desperation, not anything that could be conceived as a
    comfort stop. She decided to proceed to the south island.<br>
    <br>
    Vickie was now surrounded by water and with no possible place to stop was seriously
    struggling with a full bladder. When she exited the north tunnel she was rocking the upper
    part of her body back and forth. She had learned to drive last year and she was taught to
    always keep both hands on the wheel but she could no longer do that. She alternated
    between rubbing her thighs with her left hand and actually grabbing herself between the
    legs. When she exited the south tunnel she was holding herself constantly. She made the
    right turn into the restaurant parking lot and parked. She rubbed herself and the pressure
    abated somewhat. She decided to try to walk inside. She swiveled on her buttocks throwing
    her feet out onto the pavement and stood up. She realized she was leaking and was going to
    lose control. She bent over and crossed her legs in an extremely desperate measure to
    maintain bladder control.<br>
    <br>
    Alas, it was too little too late. Vickie did indeed stand by her car and pee but not in
    the way she had planned. When she crossed her legs her skirt was caught between her legs
    and she soaked it. When the pressure subsided enough she regained control and started to
    regain her composure. She uncrossed her legs and noticed that her skirt felt extra heavy.
    Dreading it she looked down and saw a very large dark wet stain in the front of her skirt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh dear God no. Please, this didn't happen. It just couldn't. I can't believe I've
    wet myself.&quot; Vickie was on the verge of tears.<br>
    <br>
    As she stood there in the dawn's light she took stock of her situation. 'I can't cry,' she
    thought. 'If I cry it will be an admission that I wet myself. No one knows how my skirt
    got wet and if I don't do something stupid, nobody will know. Crying is definitely out.'
    Other than an initial tear or two Vickie did get control of her tear ducts. Then she drew
    herself up and with head held high she walked into the restaurant and glanced around to
    find the restrooms. When she had finished her long sought pee she walked out of the
    restroom over to the serving line to get a Danish pastry and cup of coffee. Vickie never
    showed any embarrassment even though she saw several people looking at her strangely. She
    walked over to the newsstand and bought a paper inviting other curious glances. In her
    heavy skirt Vickie finally found a table and sat down with her Danish, coffee, and paper.<br>
    <br>
    When she sat down she felt wetness on her bottom. Uh oh, my wet panties are making the
    seat of my skirt wet. Oh well, if anyone looks at my backside when I walk out they will
    definitely know I wet myself. What is done is done. I don't know anyone in here so I am
    not going to try to hide what I have done. She read and ate for the better part of the
    next hour. Then she noticed that many of the people who were in the restaurant when she
    entered had gone. She thought with irony that she was about to show an entirely new group
    of people that she had wet herself. Smiling inwardly she got up to leave. She couldn't
    help running her hand down her backside where she felt a somewhat smaller wet spot than in
    the front and then she held the paper over her backside and walked out.<br>
    <br>
    Seated in her car she now thought about how she was going to keep what she had done from
    her two roommates when she got to her apartment in Virginia Beach. She knew she would
    think of something and she then began to think of how much fun she was having. She put her
    hand into her crotch pushing her wet garments to her crotch. As she rubbed slightly she
    thought, &quot;I think I've been missing out on something.&quot;<br>
