    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So, I'm sitting here on
    my day off doing absolutely nothing. Well, not nothing...I'm listening to music and
    looking at dirty pictures on the Internet. A pastime I don't tell anyone about. I also
    have a very full bladder...another hobby I don't tell anyone about.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I am so wet right now that my pants
    are damp, although I haven't actually lost control yet. Really, I've never gotten that
    far. Whether it's from fear, boredom, or intolerance to pain, I don't know, but I've tried
    countless times. I always end up giving in and getting on the toilet. Maybe this time...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While I was living with John I
    discovered this odd (?) fetish of mine. He was telling me a story. It goes something like
    this: (it is one of my favorite fantasies, so I remember it well even though it happened
    years ago)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One winter day he was in town doing
    some shopping and having a cup of coffee. The walk home was about 20 minutes. He left the
    coffee shop and began the trek. A couple of minutes later, he realized that he had to pee.
    Deciding he could wait until he got home (famous last words!), he continued on passed the
    shops, becoming more desperate as he went. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He told me he considered ducking
    into a corner but there were too many people around. So on he went. By the time he got to
    the apartment building he was having difficulty not holding himself and said that he even
    allowed a couple of quick grabs when he thought no one was looking. He was near panic when
    he entered the building. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We lived on the fourth floor and as
    far away from the elevator as possible. He shared the ride with another tenant, so he
    still couldn't hold himself and to make matters worse, he couldn't move. He couldn't pace,
    squirm or do anything that would give away his situation. Finally, the door opened and he
    got out. He thought he would be able to make it into the apartment if he could only
    &quot;pinch the hole closed&quot; which is what he did...until someone walked out of his
    or her apartment... The rest of what must have seemed like a 10 kilometer walk to the
    door, completely unable to do anything to help alleviate the pain in his full bladder, was
    spent with his hands clenched at his sides, concentrating on not peeing on the floor right
    in the middle of the hall! <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once he reached the door he felt he
    was home free. This probably gave him a false sense of security, causing him to relax a
    bit, just enough to seal his fate. He was finally able to hold himself, for a very short
    time, while he rather ungracefully jammed the key into the deadbolt. Then, he needed both
    hands to simultaneously turn the door handle one way and the other lock the opposite way. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Unfortunately for him, while he held
    on to his penis, the muscles in his urethra relaxed allowing the pee into his penis (this
    is how he described it). Once the pee is in the shaft, there's no holding it. If the
    external pressure is removed, there is nothing but an open tunnel, a clear path. So, while
    both his hands were occupied with the doorknob, it started to come out. He was in an
    absolute frenzy to get into the apartment, standing there squirming around, with his legs
    pressed together as hard as possible, and pee coming out into his pants. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When he finally got into the
    apartment, he held onto himself again, stopping the accident for the moment. He bolted for
    the bathroom but found himself still unable to go. He said that he was groaning from the
    pain by this time. As soon as he reached the toilet he realized that when he loosened his
    grip to undo his jeans, it would start to come out again. &quot;Fuck!&quot; He said he
    could feel that it was in his shaft, ready to come shooting out. &quot;Shit!&quot; So he
    got into the bathtub and took his hand away...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I wonder if he even noticed the fire
    I felt when we made love that night. I never asked, but I was very interested in how it
    made me feel and I soon began to masturbate with a full bladder.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I still have to go. It's getting bad
    now. This is where I usually give up and go to the bathroom. My abdomen is tender and my
    vaginal muscles and anus are doing a little dance. I like that feeling, it makes me want
    to touch myself. I want to touch the spot between my clitoris and my vagina. That will
    send shivers all over my body. I know that if I insert my finger just inside my vagina and
    rub, it will make me moan out loud. If I bring myself to orgasm it will be very intense
    and satisfying, but I'm not going to do that right now. I wonder what it would be like to
    be unable to control it. I want to feel myself let go unwillingly and TRY to stop but be
    completely unable to. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I've only come close (as an adult)
    once. I was very bored in college. It was a private school and anyone who's ever been to
    one (at least the one I was at) knows it's very easy. Just to amuse myself, I decided not
    to use the washroom at all at lunch (I usually go twice). By the last period of the day, I
    was pretty uncomfortable (and very turned on). It was a long class - I spent it feeling
    the pleasure of the spasms in my urethra and anus but also vaguely aware that it was
    becoming a problem. I could not hold myself, wiggle or do anything to alleviate my
    discomfort. I could only squeeze my legs together and hope. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After class I got into my car and
    drove home. It was so painful I could hardly stand straight, but I could hold myself at
    this point and was doing it with relish. I was rubbing myself between spasms and pushing
    my hand hard into my crotch when it became too much. I was sooo wet. I could feel how
    slippery I was through my pants. I've never met a man who could make me that wet. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once I was safely in my apartment,
    with the door locked shut, I sat in front of the mirror at first and watched the crotch of
    my jeans become damp, then wet, then glistening. I stood up and felt the wet heat on my
    left leg, then right, slowly moving down. It was magnificent! There was a rather large,
    interesting puddle forming around my feet and the emptying of my bladder was sweet relief.
    It wasn't a real accident. I let it go willingly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I am in serious pain right now and
    my body is actively telling me to find the bathroom, but I think I can hold on. My crotch
    is dancing around like crazy and I can feel the pee pushing its way out. I'm still OK
    though. If I sit forward the seam of my jeans pushes into me in just the right spot. I can
    give my muscles a rest and relax a bit. It feels very weird, though. My body is telling me
    that I don't have long. I wonder if it'll be like the stories I've read, where some will
    squeeze out but I'll be able to stop it and hold on even longer. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I peed in my pants completely by
    accident when I was about 7 years old. My friend and I were out playing in the snow. I
    simply didn't want to go in. I don't know how long I waited but when I got into my house
    it was too late. I stood there and peed into my snow pants. I remember being unable to
    stop but I don't remember how it made me feel. I wasn't sexual yet so it was probably
    horror!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I am getting nervous. I can't
    believe how wet I am. I had to stop for a second to jam my hand into my crotch to stem a
    particularly severe spasm. I want to take off my pants and masturbate. I want an orgasm.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I told a boyfriend once about my
    fetish. He and I sat in front of my computer looking at women who had wet themselves.
    These are the kind of dirty pictures I like to look at. They make me moan, especially when
    they look real - like the poor woman couldn't help herself. He kept feeding me coffee and
    water, and wouldn't let me get out of my chair. It wasn't long before I thought I'd pee
    right there. He took me to the bed we began to fool around like crazy. I couldn't do much,
    really, because I was so full, but when he'd press on my bladder and I'd almost leak, I'd
    come closer to climax. He asked me what I was feeling...if I was sore, if I felt like I
    couldn't wait. I said that I couldn't wait and he told me to pee on him - &quot;it's OK,
    just let it go, let me feel your hot piss on my body&quot;. So I did. I screamed, &quot;I
    can't hold it anymore&quot; and &quot;Oh god! I'm peeing my pants&quot; and I let go. Wet
    sex is interesting and I came quickly, far quicker than is usual for me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I have to go for a walk or
    something. I don't want to give up yet...it's hard to stand up straight and although
    bending over with my legs crossed helps, I'm too tempted to give up, so I came back. I'll
    just sit and type and wiggle while I tell you another story.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Greg was one of the most boring
    lovers I've ever had. We were together for a month when I realized we had a routine - I'd
    get to come first - he'd eat me out then mount me and we'd do it missionary - every time. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once, he caught me off guard, ready
    to go. I was feeling horny myself; I had been watching TV under a blanket, on the couch.
    While I was waiting for my bladder to fill I was playing with myself so I knew that not
    only was I wet, I'd probably have a killer orgasm. His hot mouth and tongue on my already
    plump clitoris would be all it would take - no need for foreplay. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It only took a minute or so...I was
    pushing on my bladder (I wonder if he noticed) and his tongue kept hitting the perfect
    spot. The heat started to build to heavenly levels; those beautiful little twinges I get
    right before I explode began almost right away. The orgasm was one of the best I'd ever
    had...but my urethra gave way the tiniest bit and I peed right into his mouth. Not a whole
    lot and he didn't say anything so who knows? <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had to let a little of my pee out.
    I am so excited; I just don't want it to stop. Half way through my last story I lost all
    concentration. I couldn't type or think. My whole being is saying &quot;pee&quot;. So I
    sat perfectly still with my hands clenched and my eyes shut tight. I relaxed just a bit
    and felt the glorious feeling of urine filling my urethra then filling my pussy. Then I
    forced myself to stop. It took a lot. Oh, what I wouldn't give to soak my pants, this
    chair and the floor. My pants are a bit wet but I'm wearing jeans so I doubt that if my
    roommate were to walk in, she'd be able to tell.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had a friend in high school that
    hated taking the time to pee. She would hold it and hold it. When she felt like it was
    just about to start to come out, she would sit on her heel for a couple of minutes and
    wait for the urge to subside. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once, the bell rang for the end of
    class and she was the only one who didn't get up to go. When the teacher inquired why she
    was still sitting there, she simply said that she was about to pee her pants. He said OK
    and left. I wonder what he was thinking. She managed to get to the bathroom on time that
    time.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another time she spent half the
    lunch hour sitting on her heel. We were all outside because it was a beautiful day. The
    bell finally rang for us to go back to class but she had to stay in the playing field. She
    said she couldn't stand up yet. When she finally appeared in the school, she mysteriously
    had her gym clothes on. She told me later that she didn't make it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's taking me considerable will
    power to not go to the toilet now. I've been suffering with the need to go for about 3
    hours. It would feel so good to just let a little bit more out...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Oh, to heck with it...truthfully,
    I'm afraid I'm going to do some serious damage. I'm going to give up again and go in the
    socially acceptable fashion. Disappointed? Don't be - I've been doing this for years and
    haven't succeeded yet. My muscle control is just too good, I guess. Maybe next time...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
