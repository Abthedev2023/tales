    <br>
    <br>
    My name is May. I'm 26, 5foot 5, 9stone nearly (120 pounds) and my boy friend is twice my
    age nearly. Both of us like watersports and we play almost every weekend. It was a
    Saturday in August 2000; we were on Robert's boat under the shade of an avenue of trees.
    The afternoon sun shone on a notice board saying 'Beware- Army shooting range' so we
    stayed on board idly watching the ducks. My summer dress is the shortest a tubby girl can
    wear without looking silly. It's a pale blue with a belted waist and very full in the
    skirt covering my faded pink knickers by about three inches if I stand up straight.<br>
    <br>
    When it's hot I prefer to do without a bra but I stick out a bit so I only pluck up the
    courage when we're far from civilization. Near Coventry- that's not a problem! We were in
    George Eliot country because she's my heroine. Robert had gone to find a guidebook to the
    places she lived and I was spending a lazy hour or two pleasing myself.<br>
    <br>
    Drifting in and out of sleep on the top of the cabin, rousing every time a boat passed
    then slipping back into a daydream I became damp between my legs and wondered about a
    little rub. No one about I thought 'why not?' First a dribble, then stop it so that the
    lovely tickling feeling comes on. Sneak a finger under skirt to assess the progress, a bit
    more to drink and drift off again, wake to wave at a passing boat, dribble some more,
    tickle again, and dribble again.<br>
    <br>
    I must have been doing this for nearly an hour without arriving at a climax, just hovering
    close to the edge. The family on a passing boat included two girls lying on the roof
    apparently doing the same as me. Our eyes met and they smiled at me. It's a mystery how
    neither of the parents twigged but they were oblivious. As they passed I rolled onto my
    side to watch and felt my skirt sticking to my bottom. It was soaked, I must have peed a
    gallon without realizing it. Worse, the family decided to stop a few yards further on and
    I couldn't get up without it being obvious what state I was in. The girls would not mind
    surely, but what about the parents?<br>
    <br>
    No sooner had they stopped than the parents also took to the cabin roof no more than 20
    yards away. Although I'd stopped tickling myself I felt more and more aroused. Should I
    try and back away to avoid showing my wet skirt? If I stood up that would be possible but
    I'd have to turn round to get off the cabin roof. A pale blue dress shows wet patches very
    clearly so I decided to stay where I was in the hope that they would set off again later.<br>
    <br>
    An hour went by while my bladder filled up. Robert didn't come back; the parents and
    daughters lounged around carrying on a conversation in which they included me. It was
    obvious that they would soon be inviting me to come aboard. The berries on the bush
    overhanging our boat were some type that can be used to make a drink which the family were
    fond of, would I reach up and pick a cluster? Yes that could be done without turning my
    back but could I pass them across? No.<br>
    <br>
    A brainwave struck me. &quot;I'll bring some when Robert gets back and we'll both be
    sociable. He'll only be a few minutes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ah&quot; they said &quot;bring them over here and we'll have the drink ready for
    when he gets back.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    What a blunder! Slowly I stood up hoping for a better idea. No thinking was possible. I
    realized that a long afternoon rubbing myself had obscured how badly I needed a proper
    pee. Promptly sitting down again I claimed cramp and suggested that they put the kettle on
    and I'd be with them in a moment. Watched all the time I couldn't put off the standing
    operation any longer. If only they'd give me a minute I could rush into the boat, pee,
    change my skirt, put on a bra and bring the berries. Instead they began to point out which
    berries would be best. Pretending idiocy I pointed, &quot;Those?&quot; They looked up: at
    last a way to move without being seen but there would be only a second or two. I stood
    facing them, pointed again fearing that I'd spring a leak and as they looked I backed
    towards the cabin edge.<br>
    <br>
    Once more and my lower half would be hidden by our cabin as I stepped to the deck, but to
    do that I'd have to turn. It worked. I was down. Again I played the idiot pretending to
    point again at a different bunch. Staring straight into the mother's eyes I felt myself
    start to dribble, the sort that doesn't allow stopping; it was too late for that. Still
    looking earnestly at her as if to try and identify exactly which bunch was needed, I peed
    and peed all over the back deck.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look love I'll come and show you which ones to pick&quot; said the helpful mother.
    Panic, she would see the stream across the deck and my folly would be clear. The only
    thing to do to stop her was to get the bunch indicated and to do that I'd have to go back
    on the cabin roof.<br>
    <br>
    Reaching up to pick the berries now loomed. You will see my wet panties as I stretch up.
    Pale pink panties are hopeless for covering accidents as they show a dark patch. There was
    no turning back as I'd already gone through the charade of recognizing the correct bunches
    and climbed back to the roof. Could I have another attack of cramp? Nearing the branch I
    wondered if perhaps the offending panties might just be covered. Yes, maybe it was worth a
    try. Gingerly stretching up I looked down pretending to check my footing but really
    looking at the hemline. Back to the task, I reached and...........BANG. BANG.<br>
    <br>
    The army firing range had begun to practice. In a trice my sub-conscious saved the day. I
    grabbed myself whilst crying out in surprise. They were also taken aback but as we all
    calmed down I managed a fair imitation of someone caught unawares and quickly said
    &quot;I'd better go and change.&quot; What an understanding group of people.<br>
    <br>
    The clothes were hurriedly dropped and changed for whatever came to hand. A sports skirt
    and some white cotton undies with one of Robert's woolly jumpers and I was back picking
    berries. That was when Robert returned. We all went into the newcomer's boat and tried the
    drink. A bit sharp but refreshing it formed the basis of a long conversation about nice
    things to drink. All the while I wondered about the looks I was getting from the father
    and it made me feel uncomfortable. Robert spotted this and we made our exit.<br>
    <br>
    What was that man looking at? Robert sat opposite me and examined what he saw. Then he
    began to grin. &quot;I see a voluptuous young woman in the prime of life with her nipples
    protruding through the loose home-knitted woolly jumper and under her short skirt she
    shows soft white panties with a big yellow mark.&quot; I'd inadvertently picked an
    unwashed pair of special peeing panties.<br>
    <br>
    All that anxiety to cover my peeing together with a load of nonsense about not seeing the
    obvious bunch of berries only to be caught out and completely unaware of it. What a gaffe!<br>
    <br>
    Later in the evening the girls came round to chat and it turned out that they knew all
    along what I had been doing because they had seen my dribble across the cabin top. They
    thought it was quite amusing when they heard the full story and admitted that I had saved
    them from almost certain trouble because they had indeed been doing exactly what I'd been
    doing and were in a quandary about how they would get back to their own cabin without the
    parents knowing. Apparently they were fully-fledged knicker wetters and under strict
    instructions from the parents to stop it.<br>
    <br>
    A rather stern voice soon called them back in a few minutes. I hope I didn't get them into
    trouble. You can imagine the worried father talking to his wife about the country being
    infested with wet-knickered women. I wonder if it is.<br>
    <br>
    Have a wet day.<br>
    <br>
    Yours,<br>
