    Female Desperation.</span></strong></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><br>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Living in the dorms in college
    provided a great chance to see desperate women needing to pee.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My freshman year I lived in a dorm named Brandon
    Hall and consisted of three buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon
    Hall 1, 2 &amp; 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon Hall 1 was the
    oldest of the three buildings and as such had communal bathrooms.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1st and 2nd floors were female floors and 3rd and
    4th floors were male.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon 2 and 3 were
    both made up of suites with a bathroom between each two rooms.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon 2 was co-ed and Brandon 3 was all female.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As a Freshman I lived on the forth
    floor of Brandon 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There were two guys to a
    room and in the middle of the middle of the floor on one side of the hall was a large
    communal bathroom- 6 stalls, 6 urinal, 6 showers and 6 sinks.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shower room was a smaller room in the center
    of the bathroom with the sinks and mirrors facing the entrance to the showers.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The urinals were on the back outside wall of the
    shower room and the stalls opposite the urinals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We lacked the basic creature
    comforts of the upper classmen in Brandon 2 and 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
    had suites with one bathroom between each two rooms as well as air conditioning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Not so with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>But what we lacked in comforts we made up for in PARTY factor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Communal bathrooms have one great advantage.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shower room makes the best damn place in the
    world to put a bunch of large well-iced Kegs of beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now the fourth floor was named the
    ZOO for a reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We were the party animals
    of the entire dorm system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no one
    on campus that could throw a party like the ZOO animals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A couple of weeks into the first semester we decided to throw one of our
    signature parties.........a Kegger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We went
    out, bought five 32-gallon kegs of beer and enough ice to freeze a small herd of cattle.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Friday night came the 44 guys on the floor
    hauled the 5 kegs of beer and all that ice up to the 4th floor via the stairs and filled
    the shower room with running beer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were in
    heaven, or so I thought at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little
    did I and everyone else know that things were going to get a whole lot better than we had
    ever planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We had been passing the word of the
    party for a week and promptly at 7:00 PM we had a large crowd each with $5.00 in hand and
    their own non-breakable glass in hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We had
    very few rules for our keggers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No fighting,
    no puking on the carpet, and you don't drink out of anything that breaks.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Plastic wood or metal was fine, NO glass.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than that, things were pretty free.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We cranked up the stereo, and started taking
    money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every room was open and people were
    crowding the halls, people's rooms and of course the shower.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As with any good party the beer
    flowed and flowed and flowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And with any
    good beer party the pee flowed and flowed and flowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The guys would just go around the wall and pee in the urinals.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The girls for the first hour or so would go down
    stairs to one of the girls' floors and come back up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After about 2 1/2 hours of so the
    girl's bathrooms began to get a line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To make
    matters worse, the dorms locked the hall doors for the girls' floors at 10:00 PM.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which made it difficult for the girls that did not
    live on the floor to get onto one of the girl's floor so they could use the facilities.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had been talking and dancing with
    a really cute little red head named KC all evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    had gotten to know each other the first week of school and had really clicked.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had a boyfriend at an out of state college and
    my girlfriend was a senior in high school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    sort of became a couple without a commitment, as well as without some of the perks.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But she was fun to be with and a really good
    friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Around 11:00 or so, I noticed that
    KC was getting a little quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her
    what was wrong and she stated she needed to pee but she didn't want to have to go
    downstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She complained that it was hard
    getting on the floor since she lived in Brandon 3 and didn't have a key for the floor and
    because the line had been pretty long a the last time she had went.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she could wait a few more minutes and we
    went back to talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did notice however
    that she was rocking her legs back and forth, like a little kid would do in school when
    they had to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A few minutes later she said she
    would be right back, and left to go pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    was back a lot faster than I thought she would be and when I asked her if she felt better
    she scowled and said NO.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went on to tell
    me that the line for the bathroom had 15 girls in it on the 2nd floor and she didn't even
    go down to 1st floor to look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked at
    me and said, &quot;I got to pee pretty soon, suppose I could use your guy's
    bathroom?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I smiled and said, &quot;sure,
    you're welcome to, but I don't think you will want to.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her to come on though, cause I had to go
    anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We walked into the bathroom and
    around to the urinals and stalls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked up
    to a urinal, pulled out my dick and took a much- needed piss, smiling and laughing all the
    while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>KC didn't think I was very funny as I
    pissed and chuckled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What I had neglected to
    tell her was that in the men's communal bathrooms we had stalls, but no doors.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Having lived a few years in Europe
    when my father was in the military, I am aware that a large portion of European women are
    not all that shy when it comes to taking a pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
    the Autobahn it was nothing to see a bare white German female butt pointed toward the road
    with pee pouring onto the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We here in
    the states are a little more sexually repressed than that, and women here just don't do
    that for the most part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I finished and KC just scowled at me
    and said thanks a lot, I can't pee there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
    are no doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I said suit yourself, but I'm
    not the one dancing around in a bathroom dying for a pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She swore at me and called me a bastard when two guys walked in and began to
    pee into the urinals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sound of both of
    them peeing was just too much for KC and she dashed into the last stall and dropped her
    jeans and panties and quickly sat down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
    the look on her face and the splashing in the bowl you could tell she was really enjoying
    the relief she was getting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With no door I
    just watched the whole show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What I didn't realize at the time
    was that behind me on the other side of the bathroom were a couple of other girls who also
    needed to pee pretty badly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they
    happened to look over and see KC peeing in our bathroom they decided that they didn't want
    to wait in line either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They discussed it
    between themselves for a couple of minutes, then one of them rushed over to the stall next
    to where KC was just finishing up and promptly took a pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Her friend was right behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Figuratively and literally that
    night the floodgates opened.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When word of
    what KC and the other two girls had done, mixed with a whole lot of beer drinking, got
    around a lot of the women on the floor quit going downstairs after that.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Modesty lost out to intoxication and an aching
    bladder and our bathroom was never the same again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
    were times that the sound of pee hitting porcelain was louder and stronger than beer
    hitting the bottom of empty cups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
    say, I and several of the guys from that point on relieved ourselves a little more
    frequently that night for there was always a show to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>As for the party, well we made our investment back on the door charge and
    had enough left over to do the whole thing over again the next month.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Things between KC and I were never quite the same
    after that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her boyfriend just decided one
    day that he didn't want a long distance relationship without sex and as for my
    girlfriend...well, I guess a senior cheerleader isn't supposed to sit home being faithful
    either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which worked out find for KC and I,
    and she was never pee shy around me again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    that's another story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
