    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It had been a really lovely day.
    We'd been camping for almost a week and Des and I were so close it was perfect! We shared
    everything, told each other everything - a magical relationship, in fact.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We'd been together for about two
    years, and once - and only once - I'd told him how I felt about getting desperate to pee.
    He'd taken it well; excited even - but I'll tell that story another time!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There had been a couple of times on
    this camping trip when one or the other of us had been pretty desperate but we'd always
    managed to reach a bathroom before disaster struck and on this particular night I was hot
    and ready for something to happen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We'd been to a bar for a few drinks
    - I'm teetotaler so had been drinking a lot of Coke after a hot day. Des had had beer,
    which always makes it's presence felt in his bladder quickly, so as we were getting ready
    to leave the bar he said, with some urgency, that he must go and pee before we set off
    back to the camper. I frantically thought of ways to hold him up. I was already sitting
    with my legs tightly crossed, leaning forward in my seat to press my pee-hole against the
    wood of the bench and was getting a little excited... He took the used glasses back to the
    bar, and to my surprise, picked up his jacket and moved to the door! He'd forgotten to
    pee!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I stood up from the bench, I
    realized just how badly I needed to go, never mind Des. A shiver went down my back as I
    clenched my muscles to get a hold of my need, but it was ok, I wasn't about to pee my
    pants. However, as we walked out into the now cool evening air, I felt a stinging in my
    pussy that was ominous. I dropped back behind Des a little and pushed my fist into my
    crotch. That helped me to gain control. I didn't want Des to see that I needed to pee, in
    case it reminded him of his own need - we were still near enough for him to go back and
    use the facilities in the bar.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once we we'd walked too far to go
    back, I said, &quot;Des, I really need to pee!&quot; I wanted to see what his reaction
    would be. He looked worried and said, &quot;So do I! Why did I forget to go before we came
    out?&quot; I squeezed his hand and said, never mind, we'd be back at the campsite soon and
    we could both go. I was enjoying the sensation of having to hold onto my own pee and
    knowing he was pretty desperate too made that even more intense. It was dark, so I could
    occasionally sneak my hand into my crotch to press on my peehole without anyone noticing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly Des said, &quot;I REALLY
    have to go! Look for somewhere I can unzip!&quot; I told him he couldn't possibly do that
    here - we were approaching the campsite and there were up-market caravans around and worse
    still, the camp owner's bungalow. As I was concentrating on his need I forgot my own
    troubles for a moment and was shocked when a small spurt of pee shot into my knickers. It
    was only a drop but I shoved my hand hard into the seam of my jeans and held on tight. I
    said nothing to Des and we struggled on, not really talking, each trying to concentrate on
    holding back the flood. I was doing ok till an owl (of all things!) hooted, somewhere
    right near us. I jumped out of my skin and a bigger spurt of hot pee went into my panties,
    I felt it spread out along my jeans and when I pushed against my crotch my hand came away
    damp. I said in a panicky way, &quot;I've peed in my pants!&quot; Des reached out to feel.
    &quot;You bad girl,&quot; he said with a sly smile and then his face fell as he grabbed at
    the front of his trousers and said, &quot;Hell, I'm going to pee mine if we don't get back
    soon!&quot; I looked down at his front and saw a tiny wet spot there.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We were both walking in a tensed-up
    way by now and I kept pushing against my jeans to try to stop the bursting feeling. I was
    sweating and shaking and when Des grasped impulsively again at his cock through his
    trousers, a slightly bigger patch appearing, I had a strong pulsating between my legs and
    several strong spurts shot out of my peehole. &quot;I'm really going to pee myself&quot; I
    cried - I'd NEVER done this before outside of my home, not since I was potty trained as a
    child! Des said, &quot;Well, I'm not going to pee in MY pants, and I've GOT to pee right
    now, and he just unzipped his fly, got out his dick and just pissed and pissed regardless
    of whether anyone could see or not! This was absolutely too much for me. As I watched him
    getting that blessed relief I just let go! The first spurt was so hard that it shot thru
    the material of my jeans onto the ground in front of us - pee from the pair of us was
    pooling on the ground and we watched it. My own seemed to go on forever, my jeans were
    soaked, front and back, and of course all down the legs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then Des came nearer, he unzipped my
    jeans, put his dick inside and peed the last of his golden liquid into my pants. As he
    pulled my jeans apart at the zip the hard material of the seam pressed against my clitoris
    and I start to orgasm. I reached down and took hold of his rapidly hardening cock and
    said, &quot;Put your hands into my panties, quick!&quot; Needless to say he did and I came
    immediately, so hard my legs almost gave way.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We walked back to our camper,
    cleaned up and had the most sensual night of our lives!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I &quot;can't wait&quot; to go back
    again this summer!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
