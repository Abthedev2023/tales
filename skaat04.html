    Episode 4 - The Wet Zone</strong><br>
    </font><br>
    <br>
    As Laurie's jeep was riding over campus grounds once more, she had some trouble keeping
    her mind on the road. Laurie sat fidgeting in her seat, trying to keep her feet on the
    pedals; she was wearing sandals, and she could see her toes curling in them. Her white
    cotton panties were already wet with sweat, partly from the heat, partly from the
    excitement but mostly because she was holding her sphincter muscle closed with all the
    strength in her body. Laurie was wearing a pink dress with a flower pattern, and both her
    thighs were pressing hard against each other through it; the soft fabric was the only
    thing that prevented her equally sweaty legs from touching each other (which she reckoned
    was a dirty feeling). The fact that Cathy was sitting next to her with legs crossed and
    one leg kicking against the dashboard nervously didn't help either- both girls really had
    to pee, but every attempt at reaching a bathroom that evening had been catastrophic so
    far. <o:p></o:p></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Look, I'm sure it's too late
    for her,&quot; Cathy pleaded, &quot;why would that creature take Kitty to the biology
    building anyway?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm not saying it did,&quot;
    Laurie answered, &quot;but I know it didn't kill her, so it must have taken her away. If
    it didn't take her to the biology building, I'm sure we'll find out there where it did
    take her.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's just that the smart thing
    to do is to get out of here as quickly as possible,&quot; Cathy remarked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm not leaving her,&quot;
    Laurie answered determined as she pulled the jeep over; they had arrived at the biology
    building. Cathy noticed that the doors were pulled out of the hinges, and that made her
    gasp in fear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's here!&quot; she whispered
    to Laurie, &quot;look!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That happened when we were
    here earlier,&quot; Laurie explained as she got out of the car, &quot;Kitty had to go to
    the bathroom and- oh God,&quot; she just realized something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What? What is it?&quot; Cathy
    also got out and crossed her legs in desperation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;There's a pattern,&quot;
    Laurie explained while walking up to the building, &quot;the first time we saw the
    creature here was when Kitty had to pee. The bathrooms were destroyed and she had her
    first accident; then, the creature came after us. It appeared again when she tried to use
    your bathroom, where she had a second accident. The third time was in our dorm, when Kitty
    was actually on the toilet - so the next time one of us pees, it might come after one of
    us.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh no,&quot; Cathy said,
    &quot;It saw me pee! I wet myself when I first saw it, remember? It must be coming after
    me next!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy started doing a pee-pee dance;
    the panic only made her more desperate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;And just when I really have to
    go,&quot; she added, &quot;I told you beer goes straight through me!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie grabbed her crotch through
    her dress and walked into the hall. &quot;It helps not to talk about it,&quot; she pleaded
    with Cathy, &quot;I'm desperate for a pee myself.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Whatever you do, don't use the
    bathrooms!&quot; the girls heard a voice warn them from the top of the stairs. A young
    woman came running down the stairs; she was in her thirties, had shoulder-length, dark
    brown hair and a nice figure, and was wearing a lab coat with numerous stains of dubious
    origin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Doctor Williams!&quot; Cathy
    exclaimed, &quot;What is going on here?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You know her?&quot; Laurie
    asked, letting go of her crotch as someone was watching now. She did cross her legs and
    pressed her thighs tightly against each other, however. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I've taken biology with her
    this year,&quot; Cathy said, &quot;Dr. Williams is quite the geneticist.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Too good, apparently,&quot;
    the doctor interrupted her, &quot;it's very dangerous to be here right now, you should
    leave immediately!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She then noticed how Laurie's legs
    were crossed; Laurie uncrossed them in shame, but pressed her knees hard together. Her
    bulging bladder was not going to be able to hold on much longer, she knew, but she had to
    know what was going on first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We've been here before,&quot;
    Laurie said, &quot;I don't know what you've been doing in this building, but whatever
    creature escaped here got a hold of my friend!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let me explain,&quot; Doctor
    Williams sighed, &quot;would you like a cup of coffee or something?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'd better not,&quot; both
    girls said in unison: then they looked at each other and blushed. &quot;We would
    appreciate a visit to a bathroom you might have,&quot; Cathy added as she pressed her
    index and middle finger firmly into her crotch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Whatever you do, don't
    pee!&quot; Doctor Williams exclaimed, &quot;look, we've been creating a hybrid creature
    here - but it came out more harmful than we'd ever expected. It can't see, but senses
    certain acids that are commonly found in human urine. As long as it's contained in your
    bladder, you're safe, but the scent seems to drive it crazy.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That's why it kept on coming
    after Kitty,&quot; Laurie realized, &quot;it got her scent, just like a trained dog.&quot;
<o:p></o:p>    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But I really have to
    go-ho.&quot;, Cathy hopped from one foot on the other, &quot;and it already has my
    scent!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Did it come after you
    too?&quot; Doctor Williams asked worriedly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, I kind of wet
    myself,&quot; Cathy admitted, &quot;When I saw the creature.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Did you wash yourself?
    Thoroughly?&quot; the doctor insisted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Kind of,&quot; Cathy now
    really felt five again, being asked after she cleaned up well after wetting her pants,
    &quot;and I got clean clothes from Laurie. But I'm going to go in them again if I don't
    get to a bathroom real soon!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie was getting into big trouble
    too: not only did she have to worry about the disgrace of wetting herself, now it actually
    could get her killed! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What about Kitty?&quot; Laurie
    asked, now hopping up and down too, &quot;it took her, we don't know where.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The creature encases its
    victims in a sort of satchel, like a kangaroo,&quot; doctor Williams explained, &quot;It's
    most likely carrying your friend along for the ride. But I don't know where it is right
    now, so maybe at least it's safe to use the bathroom just now.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thank god!&quot; Cathy said as
    she bent over; she only had one beer since she wet herself, but that was bursting to get
    out! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The toilets here are
    destroyed,&quot; Laurie sighed. &quot;Look, I'm desperate for a pee too, you know, but
    it's just too dangerous to go right now!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please!&quot; Cathy begged and
    stomped her foot on the ground like a little girl, &quot;I don't want to soil your clothes
    too!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie saw her puppy eyes and was
    about to say &quot;all right then&quot; when she heard something more alarming. A slight
    dripping sound from near her, that seemed to gain in speed and strength as the seconds
    passed. Cathy and Laurie looked at doctor Williams, and saw a small yellow puddle forming
    at her feet; tears welled up in the eyes beneath her large glasses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said with
    a trembling voice, &quot;I was too scared of the creature to go before and then you came
    in here.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please stop!&quot; Cathy
    screamed, &quot;I mean it, doctor! I really can't hold on any more!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As Cathy jumped around, Doctor
    Williams just started crying harder. She spread her legs and a hard yellow stream shot out
    from beneath her black skirt; a long night's work of coffees shot out of her with an
    unbelievable force. Cathy pushed both hands into her crotch, but the hissing sound seemed
    to press harder and harder onto her bladder; Laurie tried to concentrate on something else
    and looked around her, but couldn't help doing a pee-pee dance. Both girls took a step
    backwards as the warm, yellow flood flowed toward them on the tile floor. Laurie's toes
    curled once more in her sandals as she watched Dr. Williams' pee closing in on her. Cathy
    was clearly having more trouble; she squirmed like a snake and tears welled up in her eyes
    as the only things that stood between her completely letting go were her hands, pressing
    her sphincter muscles together. A few drops escaped, but she was able to keep most in.
    When Dr. Williams had finished she still stood trembling all over in a pool of her own
    pee. She held both hands in front of her face in shame as she kept on crying like a
    schoolgirl; Cathy had never seen the professional, perfectionist woman break down like
    this. Not even daring to relax her thigh muscles, she looked at Laurie and mouthed the
    word &quot;please&quot; she knew she'd be next, although Cathy was holding herself too.
    Then, both girls heard a thump from the corridor; Cathy shrieked shortly, but not only her
    mouth seemed to open. A small squirt flowed into her panties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh god, it's here,&quot; Cathy
    said with a high-pitched voice; she knew the creature had come. Laurie kept staring into
    the darkness of the corridor, but saw no movement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let's get out of here!&quot;
    Cathy pleaded as she felt a second drop leaking out of her. &quot;Don't tempt that thing,
    come on, we'll crouch outside. Far away outside.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We can't risk that,&quot;
    Laurie said bravely, although she was bursting too and holding herself through her pink
    dress. &quot;It might have Kitty!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly, they heard a second thump;
    Cathy felt a second squirt flowing into her panties - she tightened her grip, but she knew
    she couldn't hold on much longer. She could feel that her crotch was not the only thing
    getting moist - a single drop made it into her butt crack. The thump came from the
    corridor that lead to the place where the toilets used to be. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;She's right,&quot; Dr.
    Williams sobbed. &quot;You girls leave, I'll distract it - it'll be coming after me
    now.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Somehow, Cathy was relieved that Dr.
    Williams had wet herself; that way, her moist panties wouldn't attract the beast. But
    before anyone could do anything else, a large shadow ran towards them with a fierce howl;
    Dr. Williams pushed Laurie to the side, and all the girls saw was a furry fury throwing
    itself onto the soiled doctor. As Dr. Williams fell to the ground, Cathy fell down into a
    corner, tightly grabbing hold of her crotch and kicking her feet all around her, but
    Laurie watched how the creature started to encase Dr. Williams in a satchel near its
    immense jaws. Dr. Williams kept on kicking around, and that gave Laurie an idea; she
    jumped towards her legs and grabbed her soaked panties under her short skirt. Laurie
    pulled them off, trying desperately not to lose bladder control while doing so, and threw
    them back into the corridor; with another fierce cry, the creature let go of Dr. Williams
    and turned towards her wet panties; it ran off in that direction immediately. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Doctor Williams came to, her face
    and shoulders covered in a yellowish slime as the beast took off again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Doctor,&quot; Laurie grabbed
    her by the arm with one hand while grabbing her crotch with the other. &quot;Where did it
    go? You must know!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The bathrooms,&quot; Dr.
    Williams coughed, &quot;it must be traveling through the sewers.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But where is it going?&quot;
    Laurie asked her again, now crossing and uncrossing her legs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Where it smells the most
    urine,&quot; the doctor gasped for air. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The party,&quot; Laurie
    realized, &quot;it must be going to the party Kitty and I were going to. We must stop
    it!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can we at least pee
    first?&quot; Cathy begged her, &quot;I'm really going to wet my pants, and I mean
    it!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No time,&quot; Laurie said as
    she dropped Dr. Williams and pulled Cathy through the door, &quot;the lives of about
    everyone on campus depend on us!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
