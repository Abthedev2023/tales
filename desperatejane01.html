    <br>
    I'm a 31-year-old slim blonde math teacher at this local high school. I remember a really
    memorable experience I had a while back. When the classes were done for the entire year,
    the students had to take a math exam this one particular day, and after 3 hours every
    student had finished the test and left the school. By that point, I had to pee kinda
    badly. <br>
    <br>
    During the test, I think I had drunk at least a litre and a half of water, and I didn't
    get a chance to use the washroom that morning either because I overslept. Plus, I had
    drunk around 2 large cups of coffee that morning as well. But I decided to hold it in
    because I had a lot of exams to grade and such. Even though I could've taken the exams
    with me and just marked them later, but I preferred to try and get it over with now
    instead of later. With each exam I grade, the more desperate I've become. &quot;Fuck,
    there are a lot of papers to mark!&quot; After marking about half of the exams, I decided
    to head to the washroom. I head towards the staff's washroom, then noticed that it was out
    of order, so I went to the girls' washroom. But once there, I noticed the same thing, an
    out of order sign was at the door. I quickly head towards the office and asked why are all
    the washrooms was out of order.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It had something to do with a student prank... apparently the students thought it
    would be humorous to purposely overflow the toilets throughout the school,&quot; said the
    secretary. I felt really frustrated about that considering that I was had an urgent need
    to take a piss...<br>
    <br>
    I decided that I should just take the stupid exams with me, grade them later and just
    bring them back the next day. I hastily went to my car and drove off in search of the
    nearest public washroom I could find. I knew I wouldn't be able to hold it in until I got
    home, because my place would take around 45 minutes just to get to, and I had to pee badly
    by that point. <br>
    <br>
    By the time I found a gas station a few minutes later, I parked near it and went to ask
    for the washroom key. I went straight to the washroom and when I got there, it stunk so
    badly in there that I could gag... despite the fact that I had to pee so badly at the
    time, I decided that I just couldn't bear it long enough in there to use the toilet. So I
    went back inside to give back the key and looked for somewhere else nearby. After a
    desperate search, I saw a pharmacy and just thought of an idea that I normally wouldn't
    even be considering. I thought that I might as well buy a pack of the most absorbent
    diapers that they had and just use them. I hesitated for a minute but I knew I was going
    to lose control of my bladder really soon if I didn't do something, so I went in to buy
    them.<br>
    <br>
    As I walked in, I tried my best to act natural and not to show any sign of my urgency... I
    looked around and chose the one that was probably the most absorbent. &quot;Nice day we're
    having today, huh??&quot; The cashier asked me kindly. &quot;It sure is real nice and
    sunny today!&quot; I responded, trying my best to respond and not to letting my words
    swirl or stutter due to my full bladder. <br>
    <br>
    After purchasing them, I said good day, and went bursting into my car... so to speak. I
    put one on and even though I knew I couldn't hold it in much longer, I was still felt a
    bit hesitant because this felt really weird- a grown woman in her late 20's in this
    position... not too common. But I couldn't really drive in this predicament, so I decided
    to quickly get into the backseat because the windows at the back are tinted so nobody can
    see what I was doing.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the fact that it felt really weird, I started to feel this bizarre pleasure from
    holding it in. Soon after trying to hold it in, I started peeing just a bit into the
    diaper. Moments later, I started leaking out larger bursts, and eventually, I lost total
    control of my bladder. I didn't even bother trying to stop it; I just let it naturally
    flow out. During the entire time, I thought it felt sooooo good relieving my bladder.<br>
    <br>
    After what seemed like an eternity, I had finally finished. I quickly slid the diaper off
    and quickly drove back to my place. All and all, I actually quite enjoyed this more than I
    thought... I knew I would definitely enjoy doing this again in the near future... but next
    time, I would test it out with much more fluids going into me...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    A week had passed since the incident at school with me holding a full bladder in during my
    students' math exam. Now, I've finally finished my job at the high school, and have been
    on summer vacation for the past 2 days. One morning when I woke up, I realized that I
    didn't have anything to do, so I had decided that I should test the limits of my bladder.
    I decided that since I still had the extra diapers I bought last time when I was
    desperate; I could try using them again since I don't know any good spots I could go other
    than the bathroom. <br>
    <br>
    Anyways, since I had awoke from bed that morning, I had drunk a bit of water whenever I
    could, and I made sure I use my water bottle because I was curious to find out just how
    much water I could drink before becoming desperate. Throughout this entire ordeal, I
    started feeling aroused and somewhat excited. Since last time that this had happened, I
    couldn't think about anything except about my bladder, so I made sure to try and preoccupy
    myself from obsessing over my bladder by doing my regular routines, like email, phoning,
    watching some news, etc.<br>
    <br>
    Before I had started feeling really desperate, I made sure that I had put on a pair of
    diapers to make it more convenient for me later, because I didn't want to try risking it
    by putting them on with a full bladder and in a desperate state. Also, I made sure that I
    closed the curtains in my apartment because I was afraid some random guy or whoever may be
    watching me. During this entire time, I kept checking the time more often then I normally
    would because I was getting too excited and couldn't stop myself from checking it. If I
    remember correctly, I kept checking it at least once every 5 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    Roughly 3 hours had passed since I had started doing it, and I could already start feeling
    the pressure in my bladder, but I wasn't desperate yet. Unfortunately, by this time, I had
    already done all of my normal routines, and I wasn't sure what I could do to kill some
    more time and keep my mind occupied. I decided to just watch some TV while waiting for
    what my bladder to do what it does best. After flicking through some channels on TV, I had
    finally found a movie that I loved to watch, and luckily, it was a long movie and it was
    still in the very beginning so there was still at least a couple hours left before it
    ended. <br>
    <br>
    While watching the movie, I kept absentmindedly drinking my cup of water. During
    commercial breaks, I kept going back to the kitchen to refill my bottle because I kept
    running out. Eventually, without noticing, I had drunk over 2.5 litres of water by the
    time that the movie was over. Add that to the other 1.5 litres of water that I had drank. <br>
    <br>
    After the movie had finished, I noticed that it had been a little over 5 hours since I
    started, and by that point, I had to pee quite desperately. Even though I really had to
    pee badly, it still wasn't enough to make me want to do the pee pee dance.... if you know
    what I mean. I decided to continue trying to keep my mind off my bladder by going to check
    my email and calling my friends again. After a whole hour had passed, I had to go so badly
    that by that point, I was desperate enough to actually do the pee pee dance. Because of
    that, I knew I was close to losing control of my bladder.<br>
    <br>
    I went to lie on the couch and tried to watch some news or something. After some time had
    flew by, I had to pee so badly that I knew couldn't hold it in much longer and no matter
    what I did, I couldn't keep my mind off of it. A couple of minutes had passed, then all of
    the sudden, someone called me. I went to check the caller ID, and I noticed that it was my
    boyfriend who was calling me.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Darn... I don't know exactly how much longer I can hold it in,&quot; was the first
    thought that came into my head. Despite the fact that I already knew that I would lose
    control of my bladder quite soon, I decided to pick up the phone and start talking to him,
    but also try to keep the conversation as brief as possible.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hello?&quot;, I said. &quot;Good afternoon, sweetheart!!&quot; He said with a sweet
    voice.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Want to have lunch together later today??&quot; He asked.<br>
    <br>
    With the full bladder on my mind, I tried to answer as clearly as I possibly could under
    the circumstances. &quot;Surrrre honey, IIII.... can have lunch with you!! What...
    time?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, he noticed me stuttering a little, so he asked me if anything was wrong!<br>
    <br>
    I told him nothing was wrong, but he really thought I had a problem or something. I kinda
    laughed a tiny bit because he doesn't know that he's actually talking me into losing
    control of my bladder into the diaper. But I also thought that he was sweet to have been
    so concerned about me.<br>
    <br>
    I assured him once again that there wasn't anything wrong, so he dropped the subject.
    Anyway, he suggested 3:30pm. I looked at the time and realized it was only an hour from
    then. I decided that it would be a good time to meet up. We both agreed to eat lunch at
    that time and after saying our usual romantic goodbyes we then hung up.<br>
    <br>
    Since I had to meet him in an hour, I decided to kneel down right there by the phone and
    slowly release a jet of pee. I intended to only let a few seconds of pee out, but
    inevitably, I couldn't control just how much I could pee out at once because I was too
    desperate, and so I just started peeing uncontrollably. <br>
    <br>
    I didn't care though because it felt soooo good peeing like that. The stream of pee
    literally lasted over a minute before I was completely emptied. And I enjoyed every moment
    of it all up to the point that the last drop of pee I had in me came out. I felt so
    relieved that I started masturbating a bit. Then I quickly examined the diaper after a
    moment and noticed that the diaper was so full that if I had to pee any more, it could've
    start to leak out. I just quickly went to throw the wet diaper in the garbage can and take
    a long shower to get rid of the smell of my urine. Then I hopped into some clean clothes
    and went to have some lunch with my loving boyfriend.<br>
    <br>
    On my way there, I decided not to tell him about my new pleasure for now, considering that
    I wasn't sure how he would take it, even though I thought it was kind of funny that he was
    talking to me on the phone just a moment before when I was in my full bladder state!!!!
    Overall, this was a very great experience for me!!!<br>
