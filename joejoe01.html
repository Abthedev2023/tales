    I'm 18 years old, female, and a senior in high school. I have a story I think would fit
    nicely on your page.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was Friday night and I had a
    track meet the next morning as I usually did on Saturday mornings. I went to bed at about
    11 o'clock since my meet started at 9 AM and I was in the first event, so with the hour
    traveling time I needed to get up at about 7:30. I went to bed, and since it was a Friday
    night, went into a really deep sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I woke up the first thought
    that came to my mind was: &quot;I really have to pee!&quot; since I hadn't gone all night
    it was time for my morning piss. Then all of a sudden I looked at the clock and realized I
    had forgotten to set my alarm. The time was now 8:10 and I was really late. I rushed out
    of the house half forgetting about my problem, but half of me was saying I'd wait until I
    got there since I didn't really have time anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I got to the platform and was
    waiting for the train. The service isn't great on Saturday mornings, so I was waiting for
    quite a while (about 15 minutes). All the time I was dying to pee, but it was okay because
    I'd be at the meet soon where there's a bathroom. Finally the train came and I got on. It
    was a local, of course, since the express trains don't run on the weekends.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I couldn't even sit down I had to go
    so bad, I stood as we pulled out of the station. I was slightly hunched over, but still
    okay and was going to make it. The train pulled into my station and I got out. I couldn't
    run because I needed a toilet so bad so I walked as fast as I could. I got inside relieved
    that I'd finally be able to relieve my aching bladder! As soon as I walked in I heard them
    announcing the girls 300m (my event). I had no time to stop at the bathroom: I had to
    change and get to the track. My desperate pussy would have to wait.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I went to the changing room to
    change and it was so hard to get my clothes off in my condition. I ripped them off and put
    on my uniform. The tight bottom piece to my uniform pressing on my bladder wasn't helping
    the situation. (It's like the bottom of a bathing suit, but tighter.) I went upstairs to
    my coach and he made all of us drink and entire pint of Gatorade before the race. He
    wouldn't accept ANY excuses. As I guzzled it down I felt the pressure on my bladder
    increase tremendously. I didn't want it to show though, because there were some really hot
    guys right there. I left and went to the track. I got there just in time. I had no idea
    how I was going to sprint in my condition, but I was going to have to try. (And I was
    hoping that knowing I'd be able to relieve myself after the race would help.)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I got in line where it took so long
    to call all the names; it was about an hour before I was at the starting line. At that
    point it was already 10:30. The gun fired and somehow I was able to run the race and I did
    pretty well. The race had made my urge to pee much worse, but I was finally going to be
    able to relieve myself. I walked into the main lobby and went over to the bathroom. Just
    seeing the door made me almost lose control. I had made it. Then I noticed a sign on the
    door. It read, &quot;OUT OF ORDER&quot; - I flipped out!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now what was I going to do? I jammed
    my hand into my crotch and went down the stairs wondering what to do. I couldn't leave
    since that was only the 300m trials and I had to run the finals, which was the last event
    of the meet (they like to give us time to rest). Track meets take forever and my next run
    wouldn't be for another four hours. My coach wouldn't let me go home first because some of
    the girls had left and not come back in previous meets.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I clutched my pussy and tightly
    squeezed it together. I was all hunched over and didn't no what i was going to do. The
    next several hours were hell! I had to keep my hand jammed in my crotch and my thighs
    squeezed tightly together and somehow I was able to manage to wait the three hours. There
    was still half an hour until my race though and the pain was worse than ever. More than
    that it was time for my second pint of Gatorade. Oh gosh!!! That was the hardest of all!
    With one hand I squeezed my crotch as tight as I possibly could and chugged the bottle
    down. My race was in 20 minutes and I was already too desperate.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I got to the track and they lined us
    up. This time it was faster and only took about 15 minutes. I got to the starting line and
    realized I couldn't spread my legs. When the gun fired I knew I had to run. I forced my
    legs apart and started to run. Just then I felt a drop of pee seep out into my uniform,
    then another, then it began to come out more and more, but I was trying to hold back the
    entire time. There I was running around a track in front of almost a thousand people with
    a stream of pee coming from my crotch. Fortunately I was able to hold back and not too
    much leaked out (not before it was noticeable though and it was so embarrassing!), but by
    the time I finished the race I still desperately needed a bathroom!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My need was almost worse now that I
    gotten a little relief. It was lose-lose: I had embarrassed myself and still REALLY needed
    to pee. I went to my coach, grabber my clothes, and ran out the door. I ran to the train
    station just missing a train. The 15-minute wait was unbearable! I was bent over with my
    thighs tightly crossed squeezing my pussy as hard as I could. Once the train came I got on
    and sat down. Everyone was staring at me since I was totally bent over and squeezing my
    crotch.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A few stations later the train got
    more crowded and it was uncomfortably tight. I was still clutching myself, not knowing how
    much longer I could hold on. Suddenly a drop of pee came out as I squeezed harder. It was
    no use though: I all of a sudden burst out in tears as my pee started shooting out in all
    directions soaking me and wetting the people around me. I ran off the train at the next
    stop with pee still pouring out and still crying not knowing what to do. I decided to walk
    home since I'd see fewer people that way and it would be less embarrassing. That had to
    have been the most embarrassing moment of my life!!<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
