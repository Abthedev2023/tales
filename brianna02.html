    Kameron woke up at 7:45 am on the dot. &quot;Oh shit!!!&quot; She screamed as she jumped
    out of bed. This was the day that Kameron was supposed to catch the 9:30 flight to
    Orlando, Florida. The previous night, she partied hard with some friends, so she hadn't
    even packed yet.<o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Calm
    down, Kameron!&quot; she mumbled to herself as she searched for her, &quot;Travel
    Checklist.&quot; It was a default checklist that she always made out whenever she was<o:p></o:p>
    traveling. It had all of the basic things that she would need to bring along on the trip.
    Kameron spotted the checklist hanging up on her refrigerator. She opened the fridge and
    took out her 32-ounce bottle of Aquafina, as she eyed the checklist quickly. She drank a
    huge gulp and then began to run around the house grabbing the necessary items for the
    trip. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Naturally, she wouldn't have much
    time to take her usual 15-minute shower, so she cut the time by 10 minutes. She brushed
    her teeth, dressed, and then went through the checklist once more. She seemed to have
    everything. Just as she dragged her luggage out to the car, she realized that she really
    needed to eat something. He stomach was making very loud noises, and she didn't want to be
    embarrassed at the airport if people heard her tummy. Knowing that there was little time
    to spare, she ran into the house to grab something to fill her stomach. She grabbed a
    multigrain bar, an apple, and 2 bottled waters. Now she was on her way to the airport.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once she started the car, Kameron
    turned on the radio to hear the traffic report. Apparently, the expressway was backed up
    thanks to a car accident. &quot;Damnit! Now how am I gonna make it on time?&quot; The
    quickest way to the airport was the expressway. The street would take forever and she
    would definitely miss her flight. The report DID state that the accident was quickly being
    cleared out and traffic would move smoothly in about 15 minutes. Kameron figured that this
    was her only real chance to make itt to the airport so she headed out to the expressway
    anyhow. Traffic was backed up much more than the news radio show had said it was.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kameron cursed to herself as she sat
    in the traffic; which didn't seem to be moving at all. In her frustration, she drank the
    majority of the water that was in the first bottle. She kept the radio station locked to
    see when traffic would be moving again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Minutes continued to pass and
    traffic seemed to only inch ahead. &quot;There are construction delays on I-96. Be on the
    lookout for even more back ups.&quot; Kameron sighed heavily. &quot;Now I am never gonna
    make this flight... I guess I'd better call and reserve a ticket for a later flight.&quot;
    Traffic still wasn't moving. Kameron hadn't gone to the bathroom since she had gotten up
    in the morning, and now she was beginning to feel her bladder swelling with the water that
    she was drinking. &quot;Man I have to pee,&quot; she said aloud, still drinking more
    water. The lack of movement from the traffic didn't allow much air on this 82-degree
    morning. Kameron's air conditioner only kicked out hot air anyhow. This water would be her
    only source of cooling off.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Traffic started to move. Kameron was
    elated! She looked at the clock... 9:05. &quot;Great, now I can still make the
    flight!!!&quot; Kameron's bladder was totally full now and in desperate need of relief. At
    the rate traffic was going now though, she would be able to make her flight and make it to
    the bathroom. She knew that she might barely make it to the restroom, but that didn't
    matter much to her. Traffic started to slow up a bit, but not too much. &quot;Oh come on!
    I have to make this flight!&quot; Kameron said to herself. Her real thoughts were about
    making it to the bathroom though. Kameron remembered the time she was stuck in rush hour
    traffic and she peed her pants badly. She certainly didn't want a repeat of that. Kameron
    was 22 years old...far too old to be wetting her pants.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally after 12 more minutes,
    traffic ran smoothly. Kameron was near speeding when she got close to the airport. Her
    bladder was so swollen that she didn't know what to do. She was excited and still trying
    to hold in her urine. Once she exited, there was a bit of a traffic backup leading to the
    airport. Kameron was irritated because she really had to pee, AND she was in danger of
    missing her flight. Traffic was moving at a snail pace through the parking lot. This could
    only mean one thing... There weren't many parking spots.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kameron's bladder really needed to
    be emptied.&nbsp; She fidgeted in the driver's seat as she tried to keep her mind off of
    her full bladder.&nbsp; The cars moved around the parking lot and Kameron looked for a
    parking spot. &quot;I have to PEE!!!!&quot; she yelled out of frustration. She was at the
    point of holding herself between the legs now. Kameron still didn't see any parking spots.
    She was squirming and fidgeting because her bladder was contracting. On top of that, her
    pants were tight, and pressing her bladder. &quot;Oh shit, I hope I don't pee my
    pants!&quot; she mumbled. Finally, she found a parking spot. Another driver saw the same
    spot, and Kameron had to zoom into the spot, and had to break hard to keep from hitting
    the car in front. She lost control for about a second, but quickly gained it back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yikes!!!&quot; she screamed.
    She could feel the wetness in her panties and it clung to her vagina. It was like torture.
    Kameron was quite a ways away from the door.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She grabbed her bags and started
    walking quickly. Feeling the wetness and not being able to hold herself was making not
    losing control almost impossible. Every step she took, it seemed like she was about to
    just totally lose control. She had a pain so sharp in her bladder that it caused her to
    double over. She knew that she couldn't walk much further without peeing herself. She
    decided that she had to let some of the urine go. She still had 8 minutes before the
    flight was scheduled to leave, and she was halfway there. She relaxed her muscles and let
    some of the urine escape into her already wet panties. She looked down to see if it was
    visible. There was a dime-sized patch between her legs. No one else could see that except
    for her. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Letting some of the urine go turned
    out to be a bad idea though. Now she had to go twice as bad. She tried to walk even
    faster, causing her to squirt in her pants. She couldn't stop walking though, but the
    squirts kept coming, and now it was visible that she was peeing her pants. Kameron knew
    that the inevitable was about to happen, so she ran to the side of someone's car, still
    squirting. She knew that she couldn't go into the airport like this and she was going to
    miss the flight. She started to cry as she tried to take her pants off to finish peeing,
    but her belt was stuck. &quot;No... NO!!!&quot; she screamed as she fought with the belt.
    This just pressed against her bladder even more, and Kameron just stood there in shock and
    embarrassment as warm pee began to flood her crotch. She cried hard as she pee cascaded
    down her legs and hit the ground. She peed for about 2 minutes, totally soaking herself.
    Some people walking by saw what was happening and they giggled and whispered to
    themselves. Totally embarrassed, she just grabbed her bags and went back to her car.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
