    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm coming, I'm coming,&quot; I yelled, setting down the cup after a final gulp and
    collecting my things on the way out after I heard Margo honking the car horn in the
    driveway.<br>
    <br>
    Usually, I am up, dressed; having my second cup of coffee and waiting on Margo by the time
    she arrives. However, the electricity went off sometime during the night and though my
    internal alarm went off early enough for me to take a quick shower, there wasn't enough
    time to fully enjoy a cup of coffee, much less a second cup. Maybe I could persuade Margo
    to stop somewhere before getting on the freeway.<br>
    <br>
    Hurriedly, tip-toeing in stocking feet across cold concrete with heels in hand, I glanced
    up to realize someone else was in the car with Margo. Oh no, I thought, was the new
    carpooler beginning today? Oh, what was his name? Mark yes, that was it. Margo and I had
    been carpooling six months now and looking for someone to join our twosome for sometime,
    but did it have to be this morning?<br>
    <br>
    Mark seemed like a nice enough man, middle 40's, typical accountant stereotype, rather
    quiet, with a low soft-spoken drawl when speaking, but his eyes were captivating. He has a
    knowing look about him, almost cynical, yet a woman could feel herself drawn into those
    pools of melted chocolate. I noticed it the first time Margo and I met him at the office
    and the way the other women seemed captivated by him, whenever he spoke.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh hello Mark, hi Margo,&quot; I said, somewhat aggravated, then apologized quickly.
    &quot;I'm sorry, it's just been a bad morning so far. The alarm did not go off and I even
    got shampoo in my coffee. Can we stop for a cup, before we hit the freeway?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Its alright with me if Mark doesn't mind,&quot; said Margo, &quot;I purposely
    arrived a few minutes early.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No problem,&quot; said Mark, &quot;I could use another cup myself and since this is
    our first morning together, I'll buy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, thank you, both,&quot; I excitedly replied, opening the car door and sliding
    into the back seat, relinquishing my front seat to Mark. At least this way, I thought, I
    could get a little composure time not having to turn around to talk with Mark and maybe he
    would just want to look out the window and not talk at all.<br>
    <br>
    Margo maneuvered her way thru the town's streets, chattering about the change in weather.
    I, rubbing my feet, trying to get them warm, added a yes or no when needed and Mark was
    occasionally glancing back and smiling.<br>
    <br>
    He was thinking, God, what I would not give right now for that to be my hand on her foot,
    inching up the curve of her leg, palm sliding over those tightly clinging silky hose. She
    is stunning with her legs crossed, first one foot then the other on her knee, hands
    vigorously rubbing and her skirt riding high up her thigh. If only it was not so obvious
    staring, I swear I could almost see tiny black pubic hairs poking through the crotch of
    those pantyhose.<br>
    <br>
    Within minutes Margo pulled into the first Tim Horton's that she saw. The drive thru line
    was somewhat longer than usual due to the cold snap we had last night, so Mark volunteered
    to run in and grab our coffees. As Margo and I sat, watching him weave through the cars,
    admiring his gait of confidence, we smiled, agreeing on the service being a treat this
    morning. Although the lines were long inside I could have jumped out and went to the
    restroom, but decided the effort was not worth it. Besides, we would be at the office
    within half an hour and the need was not that urgent.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;At your service, ladies,&quot; Mark said, tilting his head a little, as he handed
    each of us an extra-tall quad skinny.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you sir,&quot; we both replied, while I added &quot;and this size should take
    me right up to mid-morning break!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, maybe last week, but that's why I came a little early this morning because the
    city started road reconstruction this weekend,&quot; Margo said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What?&quot; I asked. Suddenly wishing I had gone inside, and glanced back as we
    snaked our way through the parking lot and to the exit.<br>
    <br>
    Mark noticed the sudden change in me and quickly said, &quot;We won't have any problems,
    everybody's inside or still in the drive-thru.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mark then thought: She did tense up, that slight flicker of panic in her eyes! The way her
    legs flinched suddenly then slowly drew tighter together. I know if my hand was between
    her thighs, I do not know whose grip would be greater, my fingers digging into her flesh
    or those muscles squeezing, preventing my hand to reach up and feel that warm crotch. I
    know she would be damp.<br>
    <br>
    Everything will be fine, I'll just sit still, drink my coffee slowly, make small talk with
    Mark to take my mind off any pangs of fullness and so long as I have my legs crossed
    there'll be nothing to worry about. There is only a little discomfort and besides, what a
    perfect opportunity to see if those Kegel exercises really do work.<br>
    <br>
    Margo pulled out, merging with traffic saying, &quot;Well, now we are set and off to
    work,&quot; while blindly pushing buttons on the radio, trying to find a station. Leaning
    back into the seat, I felt that sudden urge prompted by the hot coffee cup warming my
    hands and flowing through my body.<br>
    <br>
    Mark turned around smiling, &quot;Nothing like hot coffee on a crisp morning to warm a
    body. Wouldn't that be one of those ultimate experiences, filling a hot tub with
    coffee?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He was thinking- I would rather watch her fill my cup with pee. My hands wrapped around a
    small cup, watching her fill it to the brim, splashing over the sides, running over my
    fingers and then wiping those glistening hairs with the back of my hand before I bring
    them to my face.<br>
    <br>
    Oh why did he have to say that? I shifted slightly to the side, gradually leaning forward
    a bit, &quot;Well, yes I suppose,&quot; adding with a slight nervous laugh, &quot;that
    does sound better than warm champagne.&quot; If he keeps talking like this I will flood
    this back seat and I do not dare try to slip my hands under my skirt and between my legs
    to try and hold it back. &quot;Margo, is traffic still moving ahead?&quot; Trying to
    change the subject to no avail.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Just barely, but when you imagine that hot tub filled with coffee, will you add some
    floating toast? I'm starving and didn't have time to eat this morning.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Leave it to Margo to make some remark like that, I could not help but laugh and when I
    did, I felt it. That hard wave of fullness washing over my insides, those first
    uncontrollable drops seeping out and I crying out, &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mark quickly turned around. Margo looked in her rearview mirror, catching the look on my
    face asked,&quot; What is wrong?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can't help it, I knew I should have gotten out and went to the restroom when we
    stopped, but I didn't know there was going to be construction going on. I have to pee and
    you have to get us to work as soon as possible or find another restroom.&quot; I sat the
    cup on the floorboard thinking, if I accidentally pee, maybe I can hide it by saying the
    coffee spilt. No, they are never going to believe that, and if Margo does not find some
    place soon, that is exactly what is going to happen, an accident.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, I am trying, honey but I can't fly over these cars. Besides, I don't see how I
    can cross over two lanes much less find a restroom in this part of town.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, Mark was thinking: Can this really be happening? A dream is about to come true.
    I do not want to take my eyes off her. She is actually squirming on the seat; those hose
    must be wet and if that is so, can the seat be wet too? God, if my hand was there now to
    feel the dampness, her legs are clenched together tight. I cannot resist; I have to do it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't worry, we'll be there in no time, traffic is still moving,&quot; Mark said, in
    a calming voice as he placed a reassuring hand on the top of my thigh, slowly and firmly
    stroking as if he was willing me to take my mind off one thing for another, but it wasn't
    working. I had to get some relief. I pulled my legs up, Marks hand slid off my thigh,
    around to the front of my calf and just below my own arms as I wrapped them around my
    legs, hugging tightly. That is when I felt the first trickle run back between the cheeks
    of my ass.<br>
    <br>
    I could not look at him and yet I could not take my eyes off his. He seems so concerned,
    almost as anxious as me. Why did all this have to happen today? &quot;Margo, please,&quot;
    I pleaded, &quot;...anywhere, I'm desperate!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She is wet! I see a dark spot on the crotch. Why didn't I drive today? To have that spot
    on the backseat of my car, but then I would not have been able to put my hand on her leg.
    Feeling her desperation rack through her body, vibrating against my palm and then seeing
    that look on her face, this is heaven.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sorry, there is nowhere, they won't let me over and now we're stopped.&quot;
    Margo sounded almost as desperate as I did. I did not know if was concern for her backseat
    or me.<br>
    <br>
    I could not stand it any longer; I fell to my side, drawing my legs up tight. Maybe if I
    could just get my hands between my legs that would help. No, nothing is helping. I'm stuck
    in this car. I rolled to my stomach, pulling my knees up, half sitting half lying,
    crouched on my knees with my hands between my legs and I rocked back on my heels- anything
    for relief. &quot;I can't hold it,&quot; I could feel the tears welling up and I wanted to
    cry. All I could do was alternate the rocking and putting my face down on the seat.
    &quot;Ohhh, I'm so sorry, please help me,&quot; I begged, I did not even want to look at
    either of them now.<br>
    <br>
    Mark was ecstatic. Oh yes! Look at the back of her skirt, the wetness has soaked through.
    How long can she hold it before those little spurts turn to gushing? She mesmerizes me. I
    want to climb in that backseat and have her soak my body with her golden ocean. I want
    her.<br>
    <br>
    Mark eyes her cup on the floorboard and picks it up. Opening the car door slightly, he
    pours out the remains of her coffee. He turns completely around in the seat and Margo
    stares at him in wonder.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Margo asks.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The only thing any of us would do, if we were in her situation,&quot; Mark says,
    &quot;...and nobody other than the three of us will ever know what happened today. Do you
    understand me?&quot; Margo only nods her head.<br>
    <br>
    Mark places one hand on her back and holds the cup in his other hand. &quot;Take your
    hands away,&quot; he urges and while holding the cup and working his fingers and wrist,
    gently pries her legs apart. The dewy heat falls and caresses his hand. Then suddenly a
    spritzing washes over his fingers and he positions the cup to gather every precious golden
    drop. The warm pee was coming in spurts at first and then flowing out like a stream. He
    feels the cup become heavy and warm just like his cock, which is growing with excitement
    at the feel and sight of her being so helpless, humiliated and peeing. He never wants to
    forget this day.<br>
    <br>
    The words oh no, sounding like muffled cries escaped my throat. What is he trying to do? I
    begged for his help and he is trying to shove his hand between my legs? I cannot hold it
    anymore, the more I rock the stronger the waves sweep thru my lower abdomen. My bladder is
    bursting and I feel the spurts spilling over and downward. However, why isn't there a
    great puddle under me, and why isn't the seat soaked? What is happening? No, I do not want
    to know, I just want to forget this day.<br>
    <br>
    Very carefully, he pulls the cup away, not wanting to spill a drop and he looks at his wet
    fingers with hidden jubilation. His fantasy almost come to life would have been perfect if
    it had been just the two of them in the car. However, seeing Margo watch in amazement, he
    decides not to push his luck any further. He turns very carefully in the seat, the cup
    filled to the rim and opens door again, watching with a smile as the yellow stream spills
    over the rim and splatters on the road. With a deep silent sigh he turns in the seat
    facing Margo and glances to the backseat to catch her trying to sit up and regain some
    composure.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Looks like I was wrong this morning,&quot; he says, &quot;...not everyone was inside
    or sitting in the Drive Thru, one could even say, our cup runneth over.&quot;<br>
