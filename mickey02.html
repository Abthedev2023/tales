    It was a week before Christmas when I received a call from my friend, April. In past years
    April and I traveled home to New Jersey together during the holidays. When she called we
    discussed our options for that next week. With everything being so hectic on the airlines
    these days we opted to drive home this holiday. <o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So, on that day we were to drive
    home together April was actually running late. She lives an hour south of me these days
    and made the trip to my apartment that morning. By the time she arrived I was anxious to
    get on the road. She didn't need the restroom or anything so we got right in my Jeep and
    we were off. After a short while we reach Interstate highway 95, which takes us directly
    home. In the past April and I hardly ever had stopped for breaks. Basically we stop
    whenever we need gas, and that is when we grab a snack and use the restroom. We have
    always made good time on our trips home. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">April and I had some brief sexual
    encounters while at school. They were basically a result of our drunkenness, and we had
    never gone as far as actually having sex. She was very hot and popular and always had a
    boyfriend to keep me from really pursuing things further with her. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Back to the ride - after maybe two
    hours or so we passed Richmond and I stopped for gas. We made a really quick stop and
    neither of us used the restroom, not to my notice at the time, though. We both grabbed a
    quick drink. April got a huge 44 oz. Bottle of water, and I got a 32 oz. Coke.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of us ever really ate a whole lot during
    our drives either, just a drink or two. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Things were really cruising along on
    this day. A couple of hours after Richmond we passed through Washington with very little
    traffic, which is quite amazing actually. April had always been good at asking me to stop
    if she absolutely had to pee, but she hadn't said anything yet, even though she had
    finished every last drop of her water. Being that she was fine I pressed on towards
    Baltimore. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About an hour later we reached the
    outskirts of Baltimore. I didn't want to stop before the city. I planned to get through
    the tunnel, pay the toll and stop shortly thereafter. I was beginning to feel a need to
    pee, but no real emergency, yet. I could last until after the tunnel. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We got to within a mile when I saw
    the last exit before the tunnel. I didn't think much of it, but I sure did when I drove a
    little further and saw a long line of taillights. We had hit a real traffic jam. The first
    thing I realized was that I really needed to pee now. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Gosh, this looks pretty,&quot;
    chimed in April. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yeah, I've never seen traffic
    like this here before. I sure hope there isn't an accident in the tunnel. That could back
    up everything,&quot; I said. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We both got pretty quiet for a
    couple of minutes as we stared at the long line of cars extending into the tunnel. In the
    last couple of minutes we had only moved maybe 30 yards, things weren't going anywhere;
    traffic behind us was backing up quickly. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I began to get curious if April was
    getting as desperate as I was. If she was, she wasn't showing it. I decided to bring it up
    casually, &quot;Gosh April, I hope this gets going somewhere fast, I really need to go. I
    didn't use the bathroom when we stopped in Richmond&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh God Mikey, me too. I
    haven't gone since I left my house this morning. I really gotta go too&quot;. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Well, at least I had company, but I
    wasn't feeling any better. Thinking about it constantly wasn't helping. Added to that I
    had to keep constantly braking and clutching due to the stop and go traffic. This was
    making it hard to keep my legs pressed together. I kept looking over at April who seemed a
    bit nervous suddenly. She was bobbing her legs together while massaging her thighs. She
    had never gotten openly desperate on our previous trips and this was starting to turn me
    on. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ten minutes later we had moved maybe
    a quarter of a mile and we were still another quarter of a mile from the tunnel entrance.
    I began to wonder what would happen if we entered the tunnel and one of us couldn't hold
    it any longer. The tunnel is maybe two miles long and surely we would be in there for
    quite a while. Thinking of that was killing me. My need to go had tripled in the last ten
    minutes. April and I weren't talking much, she was staring out the window, but I noticed
    that she was changing her position about every thirty seconds. Every time she changed
    positions I noticed she would casually slip her hand past her crouch for a quick squeeze. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Noticing this was turning me on,
    even though I probably needed to go more badly then her. I wanted so bad to get a grab at
    my cock, but I couldn't do it without being obvious. I was dying from the pressure
    building up. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A minute or so later I pressed the
    clutch and I felt a couple of drops squeeze out. I squeezed as hard as I could without
    grabbing myself and I was able to stop the flow. I looked down and luckily nothing was
    showing through on my jeans. I was very worried and began doubting that I would be able to
    hold on much longer. I began thinking about pulling off to the shoulder and just letting
    go. The very thought of relieving myself was making it harder to hold on. I was dying to
    let go. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was moaning under my breath and I
    noticed April was doing the same. I looked over and she had her legs crossed tightly while
    bobbing her right leg. She had her hand held between her thighs. I looked at her and
    rolled my eyes. She moaned in agony. I believe she was about as desperate as I was. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple minutes later I thought I
    had lost it. I had again pressed the clutch when another squirt escaped, only this time
    when I tried to stop I couldn't. A quick jet of pee escaped and I looked down as my crotch
    began to darken.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Shit!!&quot; I muttered as I
    grabbed my cock. With my grab I was able to again stop the flow after maybe three long
    seconds of pee. April looked at my crotch and instantly grabbed her crotch as well.
    &quot;Oh God, Mikey, are you wetting your pants?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;God April...I can't hold it
    much longer. I'm having an accident. I just let a little out. I must pull over. I'm just
    gonna have to go on the side of the road!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mikey, what about me? I gotta
    go just as bad! I can't just go on the side of the road like you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;April, I don't know how good
    you are at holding it, but it's gonna be like another hour before we have any chance to
    exit. So, if you really gotta go you'll get out and do as I do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh God, all these people will
    see! I can't just pull down my jeans in front of all these cars! Oh God!!! But I can't
    hold it another hour!!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;April, after I get back in the
    car just get out and wet your jeans. You won't have to pull your pants down. I have towels
    you can sit on until we get somewhere we can change.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh Mikey, I don't think I can
    do that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, do whatever, but I'm
    pulling over.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With that I pulled onto the shoulder
    and jumped out. I began squirting in my pants as I rushed to right outside April's door
    and turned my back to her. I quickly unzipped and pulled out my gushing cock. Thirty
    seconds later April rolled down her window a crack, &quot;Ok, Mikey hurry up and finish
    and get back in the car!!! I'm gonna get out after you and wet my jeans. Hurry!!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sound of my pee hitting the pavement had to be
    making it tough on her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I kept right on peeing for another
    thirty seconds when I heard April open her door. &quot;April, hold on! I'm almost
    done!&quot; I turned my head and April opened her door and hopped out. She stood next to
    me and got locked in a stare with my huge cock as my last squirts were escaping. She was
    bending at the waist with both hands buried in her crotch, &quot;Oh shit.... I'm gonna do
    it. Oh fuck! I'm going...oh shit...shit!!&quot; I quickly shook and buried my cock back in
    my damp briefs. I stared as she spread her legs and squeezed them together again,
    &quot;It's okay April, just let it go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh God, here it comes!! I'm
    going to wet my pants.... oh god, oh...ohhhh!!! Mikey please don't watch!! Oh shit!!&quot;
    She unzipped her fly and shoved her hand in her jeans. She closed her eyes and tilted her
    head back. She was breathing heavily as I watched the flow begin. At first it started
    slowly down her legs and it stopped briefly, &quot;Oh God!! I'm going, I'm
    going...ohhhh!!&quot; With that, the pee poured out. Her ass was soaked in two seconds. It
    quickly got wet all the way up her butt crack almost to the top of her jeans. She spread
    her legs a little more and her legs were instantly soaked. Watching this, combined with
    the warm dampness in my own briefs was giving me wood. April peed for maybe a minute. When
    she finished she gave herself a quick rub and zipped back up. She turned to me, obviously
    ashamed of herself, not looking me in the eye, &quot;It's Ok April.... these things
    happen, let me get those towels real quick and we'll get out of here&quot;. Her jeans were
    completely soaked and clinging tightly to her legs. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I spread the towels on her seat and
    we rejoined the traffic. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We really didn't say too much to
    each other for the next forty-five minutes that we sat in traffic. I'm sure she was quite
    embarrassed, as was I. But I was also turned on. That was hotter than seeing my neighbor
    Casey wet herself. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After passing the tollbooth we
    turned off at the first rest area. As we got closer we realized there were a lot of people
    around. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;April, if it's Ok with you I'm
    just gonna park off in the distance and we'll have to change here in the car. I really
    don't feel like walking in there with soaked jeans, do you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yeah, that's totally fine with
    me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I passed all the parking spaces and
    headed to the farthest corner of the parking lot, maybe fifty yards from the nearest car.
    After I parked April reached into the backseat for her bag to grab a dry pair of jeans and
    panties. As she was reached back I had my head about a foot from her soaked ass. I could
    smell the pee from her jeans. She had such a gorgeous ass. I began getting a wicked hard
    on instantly. She sat back down in her seat after grabbing her jeans and panties.
    Immediately she took off her jeans and I was now caught in a stare with her soaked black
    cotton jockey briefs. She caught me as I was staring, &quot;Come on Mikey, I'm not the
    only one getting naked here.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Right! I'm right behind
    you!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I reached in the back for my bag
    and got a fresh pair of jeans and briefs as well. I could hear her as she was changing
    panties. I had to hurry; I was missing all the action. I turned back around with my
    clothes as I saw her pull up her jeans over a light blue thong. Oh it looked so good!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had a problem though. I was now
    totally turned on and I couldn't shake my huge hard on. I'm sure April could notice the
    bulge I was sporting. &quot;Well...come on Mikey.... time for you to change...let's
    go,&quot; she said with a huge smile. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Right...&quot; I said with
    hesitation. I had no choice; I only hoped somehow she wouldn't stare. I wasn't that lucky.
    I unzipped my jeans and took them down to my knees. I was screwed when I saw my soaked
    briefs clinging to every inch of my hard on. Christ, I was almost popping out of the top
    of my underwear. I quickly covered my cock with both hands...<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mikey...um.... you kinda
    excited?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sorry babe...I don't know
    why...but...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mikey, it's okay... just let
    me help you out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With that she reached her hand over
    and held my hand that was covering my cock. She slid over the console and sat right next
    to me. She began massaging my thigh and blowing in my ear. I turned my head towards her as
    she stuck her tongue down my throat. As we were kissing she began to massage my hard on
    gently over my wet briefs. She withdrew her kiss and went to my cock. She took down my
    briefs and began jerking my cock and hard.... It didn't take but a minute before I shot
    hot cum all over the steering wheel and dash. We kissed again for another minute...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I proceeded to get changed after
    that. We got back on the road after our short delay....<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We didn't make it all the way home
    without another couple of stops...but that is between the two of us!!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
