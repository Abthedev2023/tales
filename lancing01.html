      <br><span lang="EN">
      <p><br>We exited the coffee shop with our coffee in hand and got back on 
      the road. We had a full day of driving ahead of us. We got into the Ford 
      Focus we were driving and were off.</p>
      <p>"You ready for a fun day, Holly?" Jason asked me.</p>
      <p>The day would be full of driving, but tonight would be fun. Today was a 
      very special day for me, it was my twenty-first birthday and we were 
      headed to Vegas!</p>
      <p>"Of course!" I said enthusiasticly. Me and Jason hadn’t been dating 
      long, just over a month. I wouldn’t say I love him, but he is cute and kind, and when he said he would take me to Vegas, I 
      couldn’t refuse. We’ve never gotten intimate, but I bought some black sexy 
      silk bra and panties that I was wearing under my jeans and blouse for 
      tonight.</p>
      <p>"It was nice of my sister to let us borrow her car." Said Jason</p>
      <p>I agreed with him. Me and Jason were both college students, we didn’t 
      need any cars, we could get around just fine walking or on a bike.</p>
      <p>Jason put on his music and we headed down the highway from Bakersfield 
      to Vegas.</p>
      <p>The coffee that I drank had gone right through me, it hadn’t been a 
      long time since we left Bakersfield and I already had to pee. Me and Jason 
      hadn’t known each other long and I didn’t feel comfortable telling him I 
      had to go, I didn’t want him to think I had a small bladder or anything. I 
      decided to just hold it and wait for him to say he needed to go. We were 
      getting into the desert though, there were starting to be less places to 
      stop. I was already in mild discomfort, but I’m a big girl, I can hold 
      it.</p>
      <p>"We should stop here." Said Jason, there was a sign that said ‘no gas 
      50 miles’. I was saved, I had to pee really bad.</p>
      <p>This was a real run down place, only two real old gas pumps and a small 
      shack. Because they were the last gas station for fifty miles they could 
      get away with charging five dollars per gallon where everywhere else was 
      three fifty.</p>
      <p>"I’m gunna go find the bathroom." I said. There was no shame in that, 
      we were at a gas station with no stops for a while. </p>
      <p>I went inside the shack. "Excuse me sir, where is your bathroom?"</p>
      <p>"No bathroom ma’am" he said in a heavy Latino accent. I didn’t want to 
      hold it any longer. This might have been the first time in my life that I 
      thought ‘I don’t know how long I can make it.’</p>
      <p>I went back to the car "They don’t have a bathroom here."</p>
      <p>"That’s too bad." Said Jason. That wasn’t what I wanted to hear, I had 
      to go bad.</p>
      <p>The car was full. Jason went behind the shack. I knew he was peeing. 
      That was a big double standard. Boys can pee anywhere, but I can’t go 
      behind the shack and pee.</p>
      <p>Jason came back to the car. "ready to hit the road again?"</p>
      <p>I couldn’t do fifty miles, I had to admit that I had to pee. "Can we go 
      back to that diner? I have to pee pretty bad."</p>
      <p>"That’s twenty minutes in the wrong direction."</p>
      <p>"Ya, but I don’t want to hold it for fifty miles."</p>
      <p>"You can’t wait?"</p>
      <p>He was being pretty persistent about not going back, that wasn’t like 
      him. "No, I can’t"</p>
      <p>"ugh" he paused "This was supposed to be a surprise, but I have dinner 
      reservations for us at seven."</p>
      <p>That was sweet of him to surprise me, and I didn’t want to disappoint 
      him. "Alright, fine. But drive fast."</p>
      <p>I’ve never had to pee this bad before in my life! My bladder was 
      bulging out visibly. I unbuttoned my jeans. I was constantly shifting 
      trying to find the most comfortable position, but I was also trying not to 
      make it obvious. I didn’t want to look like I was grabbing my crotch, so I 
      had my hand ‘resting’ on my lap </p>
      <p>with two fingers pressing down hard.</p>
      <p>"Do you really have to go that bad?" asked Jason</p>
      <p>I didn’t think I was being that obvious, and him asking me that was 
      pretty embarrassing. </p>
      <p>"Yes, I’ve been holding it all the way through the desert."</p>
      <p>"Just I few more miles"</p>
      <p>"Just hurry up before I piss myself." Since he knew how bad I had to 
      pee I stopped trying to hide it. I pressed both my hands firmly in my 
      crotch, squeezed my legs together and leaned forward.</p>
      <p>He looked over at me "Wow you really do have to go bad. My sister has a 
      five year </p>
      <p>old daughter and she keeps some larger sized pull-ups in case she has 
      an emergency like this." </p>
      <p>He reached into the pocket behind the passenger seat and pulled out 
      three pull-ups and tossed them on my lap. They were blue with snowflakes 
      and Cinderella on them, they were pretty big too, they would probably fit 
      me.</p>
      <p>"You want me to wear diapers!?" I was very offended</p>
      <p>"Well you said you might piss yourself and if that happens you can make 
      a mess everywhere in my sister’s car, or you can go in a pull-up and no 
      one will ever know except us. You might want to put on two, and then sit 
      on the third one just in case they leak."</p>
      <p>"I’m not gonna piss myself" He was talking like it was a for-sure 
      thing.</p>
      <p>"Could you just wear them, just in case?"</p>
      <p>I thought about it, the underwear I was wearing now was also for a just 
      in case scenario. I didn’t want to, I just ignored him. Moments later 
      though out of nowhere I let out a big squirt. I felt a bit of warmth spear 
      through my underwear. Dammit! I just peed my sexy underwear! I decided to 
      put on the pull-ups, just in case. I looked at Jason, he had his eyes on 
      the road. I hadn’t been naked in front of him and I didn’t want him to see 
      me change. I undid my seatbelt. He looked over.</p>
      <p>"Please don’t watch, I don’t feel very cute right now."</p>
      <p>"Well it’s like a little girl kind of cute." He said</p>
      <p>I don’t know if he was just trying to make me feel better, but it 
      didn’t work.</p>
      <p>"Just don’t look."</p>
      <p>"Fine."</p>
      <p>I took off my pants and panties, I had a dime sized wet patch on my 
      jeans, my panties were black silk and didn’t look wet, but they felt wet. 
      I slid up a pull-up. It was a little snug, but it still fit. I this slid a 
      second one over, the waist of the first one was an inch above the second 
      one, but if the first one leaked the second would catch it. I laid the 
      third one flat across the chair and sat on it.</p>
      <p>"There you go, you look all ready."</p>
      <p>I was mad "I told you not to look"</p>
      <p>"I thought you meant when you were changing."</p>
      <p>"No, I don’t want you to see me wearing diapers."</p>
      <p>"It’s okay, I think they look really cute on you.</p>
      <p>I pressed my hands into my crotch again. It was less effective now 
      because of all the padding. It wasn’t long til I let out another even 
      bigger squirt. "What the hell?" I said</p>
      <p>"What"</p>
      <p>"These things are so cold!"</p>
      <p>"Did you pee?"</p>
      <p>"No" I lied</p>
      <p>"I think you did, the ones with snowflakes become cold when you pee so 
      that you know when it happens."</p>
      <p>I was blushing, I didn’t know saying they were cold would indicate that 
      I peed.</p>
      <p>"I bet you’re glad you wore them now huh? You could have done that in 
      your underwear."</p>
      <p>"Please don’t talk about it."</p>
      <p>I held it as best as I could. I looked up and saw a diner. I got so 
      exited that I let out a significant amount of pee. "There’s a bathroom!" I 
      exclaimed. This was finally over.</p>
      <p>We drove right past it. "Why aren’t we stopping?!" I asked 
      hysterically</p>
      <p>"Were you going to go run out like that?"</p>
      <p>My bladder let loose. I let out a flood into the pull-ups. It’s like my 
      bladder knew, since I wasn’t going to let it out there it decided just to 
      just let itself out. I felt my bladder empty rapidly. I felt my pee hit 
      the pull-up and splash around before </p>
      <p>getting absorbed and releasing the cold to let me know I was peeing 
      myself. I was in my own little world. This was inevidable, Jason wasn’t 
      stopping and I had nowhere else to go. I peed long and hard into my 
      children’s training pants.</p>
      <p>"Feel better?" Jason said lightheartedly</p>
      <p>I was about to be mad at him for commenting about me pissing myself, 
      but I realized that my greatest fear here was Jason thinking that I’m 
      disgusting, but he didn’t so I told him "I do </p>
      <p>feel better."</p>
      <p>"Good, we’ll get you some diapers more your size so you don’t have to 
      worry about leaks."</p></span><br><strong>
