    </font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My experience with hospitals and
    clinics has been limited, because I have generally been in good health. My last hospital
    visit was for a maternity event, some twenty years ago. The product of that experience has
    now grown up and found her way to college, so you can guess I can no longer claim to be in
    the fresh bloom of youth. Nonetheless, with my fifty years, I certainly do not consider
    myself old, or, I hope, completely unattractive. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My experience with the clinic really
    began with an auto accident. I was in a collision, in which no one was injured seriously
    (except the car), but I did suffer from some minor damage. My right ankle and foot were
    cut rather badly, and obviously bruised. I had an assortment of other minor cuts and
    bruises, with some soreness of unknown origin. My own tendency was to get these treated
    superficially and trust they would heal quickly; but the insurance company thought
    otherwise. To cover their possible liability, they advised me to get a thorough medical
    check-up to establish whether I might have any other (perhaps not obvious) injuries. As
    they were paying for it, I agreed to comply.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The physician I had selected
    practiced in a clinic used by a number of doctors. It also had quite a bit of diagnostic
    equipment and a small lab. It was not, however a hospital, and did not care for overnight
    patients.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I arrived in the early morning and
    checked in for a nine o'clock appointment.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mrs. Karen Whitestone?&quot;
    the receptionist inquired.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes, that's me,&quot; I
    answered, standing at her counter on one leg. I was using, I hoped temporarily, a borrowed
    crutch because I couldn't put any weight on my injured foot. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She inquired for the usual insurance
    authorizations and had me fill out a fairly lengthy paper. Shortly afterward, I was told
    to proceed to an examination room. A nurse escorted me, and gave me my instructions.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The doctor will be with you
    shortly. I need to do some preliminaries, if you will just sit on the table there&quot;,
    she said, indicating the examination table. She asked a number of questions, checked my
    blood pressure and temperature, drew a blood sample, and a few other items. Then she told
    me, &quot;For the examination, you will need to remove your clothes and lie on the table.
    I am sorry, we have run out of the usual gowns, but I will give you a plastic sheet with
    which you can cover yourself. Now, if you will just get ready, it will be only a few
    minutes before the doctor comes in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I did as instructed, though it was
    rather difficult with one leg out of service. I lay on the table and arranged the sheet
    over my now naked body. It wasn't as long enough to cover me from neck to toe, but I
    arranged it so it covered most of me, leaving my feet hanging out at the bottom and just
    my shoulders at the top. I waited.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Shortly, a nice looking man,
    probably forty something, came in. &quot;Good morning, Mrs. Whitestone,&quot; he
    introduced himself. &quot;I am Doctor Murray. Now, first, let me look at that foot you
    have all wrapped up there&quot;. He was looking at my right foot, sticking out from under
    the sheet but wrapped heavily in a homemade bandage.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He spent quite a bit of time on my
    foot and ankle. He concluded that I probably had a bad sprain and an assortment of cuts
    and bruises. With his nurse, he cleaned and treated the foot and ankle, then wrapped it
    tightly in what seemed to me to be an enormous bandage.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mrs. Whitestone&quot;, he
    instructed me, &quot;I am going to have you keep off that foot for a while. Don't try to
    walk on it. Don't put any weight on it at all, for a few days. Now, I need to look over
    the rest of you and see what other damage you might have.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He lifted the sheet a section at a
    time, at times having me sit up and then turn over. He seemed to be quite thorough. He did
    quite a bit of writing and communicating with his nurse, not all understood by me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally, after an hour or so, he
    seemed to have evaluated most of my sore spots, and at least looked at the assorted
    scratches, cuts, and black and blue spots I had developed. After some consultation, he
    turned back to me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I am going to have some x-rays
    made, and a few tests run. They will be done here, and will take a little time, but they
    are important. You are not to walk, so I will have you taken there on a gurney. Oh, yes,
    after the x-rays and some other items, I want you to have a pelvic ultrasound, because you
    have indications of possible problems in that area, and I want to be sure.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The rooms where the x-rays and
    several other tests were done were down the hall from the examination room. A man came in
    with a gurney, and then left the room as the nurse helped me to transfer myself to it from
    the table.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">During the next two hours I spent a
    lot of my time trying to preserve my modesty by constantly adjusting the plastic sheet as
    I was positioned for various tests and pictures.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally, it seemed, most of it was
    done.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A male staff worker took me on the
    gurney down to where I was to have the ultrasound exam. &quot;It's down the hall a bit
    farther, and I will just leave you there because they have a line of patients and you will
    need to wait until they get to you&quot;, he casually informed me. He parked me at the
    side of the hall outside the room that evidently had the equipment. I waited. I could see
    other patients coming and going, mostly young women. Ultrasounds, in my limited knowledge,
    were used mostly for pregnant women, and several of the patients I saw seemed to be in
    that state.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a while, a technician came to
    check on me. &quot;Your name?&quot; he asked, then, not trusting me, looked at the tag on
    my gurney. &quot;Oh, yes, you're Mrs. Whitestone. And you want an ultrasound?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The doctor ordered it&quot;, I
    replied.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He shrugged. &quot;We're pretty
    busy. You have been checked?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes, the doctor just examined
    me. I've had a lot of tests!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Not what I mean. Are you
    prepped for the ultrasound?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I wasn't sure what he meant.
    &quot;Why, I think so. What do I need?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mostly, you need a full
    bladder. Has yours been checked?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was a bit surprised. I didn't
    realize this was needed. &quot;No, I haven't had that check - but I haven't gone in about
    three hours. Maybe it's full enough.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was embarrassed at discussing
    this, but he wasn't interested anyway. He just said, &quot;I'll get Mike, over there, to
    check you, when he's through with that patient.&quot; With that he rushed off. Mike, I
    could see, was talking to a young woman patient whom I could see through an open door.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I waited for a while, and then
    recognized the one he had indicated as Mike walking out, clipboard in hand, and picking up
    a new patient from the waiting room. This one, I noticed again, was another rather nice
    looking young woman. Probably pregnant, I guessed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After he passed me several times, I
    tried calling him. &quot;Are you Mike?&quot; I asked. He turned and looked at me.
    &quot;Yes, that's me? What do you need?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I was told I needed to be
    checked whether I'm ready for an ultrasound. Do you do it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm pretty busy right now. Did
    you prepare yourself?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This seemed to be getting nowhere.
    &quot;I didn't know I needed anything, but--&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He cut me off. &quot;OK, lady, I
    guess you need a bladder check. Right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Apparently.&quot; I answered.
    &quot;OK, it just takes a minute, but I'll have to do it here, or you'll have to wait
    until we can take you inside.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I suppose you can do it
    now,&quot; was all I could think to say. Something had to get moving.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He lifted the bottom portion of my
    sheet, and placed his hand on my lower belly. He pushed on it slightly, hesitated, and
    then pushed harder.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You're not pregnant, are
    you?&quot; he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No, I don't think so!&quot; I
    answered with a smile.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, you need a very full
    bladder. Your bladder's hardly got anything in it. You've got to get filled up before we
    can do you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What do I do? I was brought
    here, and I can't move myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mike shook his head in frustration.
    He walked away, and then conferred with another male employee. Mike then called back to
    me, gesturing to the other man. &quot;He's going to take care of you!&quot; The next time
    I saw Mike he had another patient in tow. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Eventually a female nurse came to
    me. She was carrying a pitcher of water and a straw. &quot;Can you sit up at all?&quot;
    she asked me. I told her I could rise up a bit, but the way my leg was fixed I couldn't
    really get into a sitting position. &quot;OK&quot;, she said, &quot;That will have to do.
    It's hard to drink a lot of water when you're lying down.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I looked at the size of the pitcher.
    It was a big one, and from the gradations on it, appeared to hold two liters. She told me
    to drink it, using the straw.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;All of it?&quot; I asked.
    &quot;All of it,&quot; she answered. &quot;If you had come prepared, it might not take as
    much, but we don't know how fast your kidneys work, and we need to get your bladder as
    full we can, as fast as we can.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She left me with the pitcher. I went
    to work on it. It took me half an hour to get it all down. After another half hour I knew
    the water was doing its work, because my bladder was sending signals to me calling for
    relief.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">No one had checked on me in some
    time, and I was getting concerned as to whether I had been forgotten. Then I saw Mike. I
    called to him. He hesitated, and then came to me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What do you need? I think
    you're in preparation, aren't you?&quot; he asked, with a somewhat irritated tone.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I think I'm ready - I feel
    quite full, now. Can I get checked?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You're probably not ready yet.
    I'll have someone check you later&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I almost pleaded with him to be
    checked. Reluctantly he raised the sheet over me and put his hand again on my belly. He
    pressed. I knew my bladder was full, but when he repeatedly pressed on it, it hurt, and I
    winced a bit.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He withdrew his hand, replaced the
    sheet, and shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You're not ready yet- maybe in
    another half hour or so, if you had enough water. How much did they give you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Two liters. I really do feel
    full, and when you pressed- &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He didn't let me finish.
    &quot;You're not full enough. You're not pregnant, so you shouldn't be complaining. Those
    ladies have a hard time holding it - you'll have to take your turn. Anyway, yes, you have
    a full bladder; but for this check it needs to be very, very full. Just hold it for a
    while, and we'll get to you later.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He rushed off. From what I could
    see, there were about three technicians doing the ultrasound; one female and two men. I
    didn't see much of the female, because she seemed to stay in the room with the equipment.
    The men seemed to be the ones taking patients in and out. I got the impression that they
    rather enjoyed working on the young women, but they didn't seem to have much interest in
    me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I lay there for a while longer,
    trying to keep the sheet arranged to preserve my modesty, but growing increasingly
    uncomfortable with my expanding bladder.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But, true to his word, Mike did come
    back in a half hour or so. &quot;Think you're ready now?&quot; he asked.
    &quot;Absolutely&quot;, I answered, &quot;and I'm anxious to get this over!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Everyone is - because you
    don't get to relieve yourself until its finished. Now, let's see how full you are.&quot;
    He slipped his hand under the sheet, and again ran his hand over my abdomen, pushing hard
    in several places. At the first push I jumped a bit at the sudden pain. He appeared to pay
    no attention. &quot;I guess you're probably full enough, now. But you'll have to wait a
    bit. We have two patients ahead of you. Just stay calm.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I gritted my teeth and waited. It
    wasn't easy to stay calm when your bladder is already way beyond its usual capacity. It
    was hurting me, now, and I wasn't sure how long I could wait.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In about fifteen minutes they
    finally took me. The procedure didn't really take long. The woman technician ran the
    sensor over my abdomen, with one of the men standing by. The sheet had been pulled up to
    my navel, so my entire pubic region was exposed. No one seemed to care. When the task was
    finished, the sheet was dropped back over me, and I was pushed into a small antechamber
    next to the examining room.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Someone from Dr. Murray's
    office will come and get you when they're ready to finish your work. But it might be a
    while, because I hear they had an emergency of some kind down there and the doctor's tied
    up. Just wait&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can I go to the bathroom,
    please? I mean- &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He knew what I meant, all right. But
    he walked away, obviously not wanting to get involved in my personal problem. I couldn't
    get up, and even if I wanted to defy the doctor's orders I doubted I get over the railings
    on each side of me. My belly was hurting something awful, and I had no idea how I was
    going to get relief.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The room I had been placed in didn't
    get much traffic, and no one was paying much attention to me. I was hurting worse with
    every passing minute. Several times I tried to call one of the staff, but no one seemed
    interested in me. I hoped Dr. Murray's man, or technician, or nurse, or whatever would
    come and get me quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There seemed to be some supplies
    stored in a cabinet in the room I was in, and then I saw a man I had not before noticed
    talking to someone outside my door. Then, to my surprise he came into the room where I was
    to get something from the cabinet. He was dressed in the blue suits the staff members
    seemed to wear, and he was about the same age as Dr. Murray, probably forty plus. As he
    rummaged in the cabinet, he glanced at me, offering a cheery &quot;Hello, there!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was squirming, moaning a bit,
    virtually in agony, and in no mood for cheery conversation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly he turned and looked at me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You look like you have a
    problem. Is someone helping you?&quot; he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No&quot;, I managed to answer,
    &quot;but I sure need it. Everyone ignores me. I'm waiting for someone to take me back to
    Dr. Murray, when he's ready for me, but -oh oh&quot; I started to moan involuntarily.
    &quot;It hurts so bad!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What did you get?&quot; he
    asked. &quot;Did they prescribe a painkiller for you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't need a painkiller - I
    just need to use a bathroom! But I can't walk, and I can't get out of this- I just had an
    ultrasound, and no one gave me any way to relieve myself!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, lady, I don't work in
    this department, and I'm not sure how to help you. But I understand your problem.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He looked me over a bit. I was still
    squirming, and moaning in my agony. &quot;You sure it's OK for you to relieve yourself,
    now? I mean, they didn't tell you that you weren't supposed to?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I shook my head. &quot;There's just
    no way. I felt like I was going to burst a long time ago. I didn't think it could feel any
    worse, but - oh, it hurts so bad!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He looked around, but saw no one who
    might attend to me. &quot;All right&quot;, he began, &quot;you say you can't walk, so you
    have to stay lying there. I don't know how to relieve you, but let me see what we can do.
    Let me see how you're set up!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I thought he was going to check
    something on the gurney, but instead he picked up the right side of my sheet and folded it
    back over the left railing of the gurney. That kept anyone in the other room from seeing
    me, but my entire naked body was lying in front of him. He looked me over thoroughly.
    &quot;My apologies - if you were a man, I'd know how to handle it, but for a woman--&quot;
    he pondered the situation, carefully studying my anatomy. After a minute or so, he said,
    &quot;Just wait a moment; I'll be back&quot;. Then he left, leaving the sheet hanging over
    the railing, and me completely exposed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In about three minutes, though it
    seemed like hours to me, he was back. He was carrying a device that looked like a small
    bottle with a kind of spout. I recognized it as a urinal, the kind used for male patients.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He studied me and looked at the
    device. &quot;You got to excuse me; I'm a lab technician, not a nurse. I don't know much
    about these things; but it doesn't look like you've got the right equipment to use this
    gadget.&quot; He studied my lower anatomy with care, then added, &quot;There was another
    kind I think maybe would fit! Let me get it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Again he left me, naked and exposed,
    groaning with the agony I was in. Shortly he was back, this time carrying a female urinal.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;From that bulge I see on your
    bottom, you've got a lot in you. I hope this holds enough. Now, let's see--&quot; He tried
    to get the urinal in proper position. I spread my legs a bit and tried to help him.
    Finally we seemed to have the mechanics right. I thought he might leave me, but he didn't;
    in fact, he held the urinal against my body with his hand. My modesty and privacy was
    hopelessly lost, but all I cared about was getting relief.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can you let go, now?&quot; he
    asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I tried to. It wasn't easy. My
    muscles were so tensed from holding that relaxation didn't come quickly. I kept trying. I
    shook my head, as I told him, &quot;I've got to go so bad, and now it just won't
    release!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Patience&quot;, he answered,
    &quot;I can wait. He spent the waiting moments focusing his eyes on my naked body, spread
    before him. He seemed to be studying my breasts.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally the patience paid off. I was
    able to produce a stream that poured into the urinal. He nodded his head as he watched.
    &quot;Now it's coming. We'll have you relieved right soon, now!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thank you&quot;, I replied. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He continued. &quot;Name's Al - I
    work in the lab down the hall. You say you're a patient of Dr. Murray? I do a lot of work
    for him. Good thing I happened by here - you must have been in bad shape. Did you say it
    hurt a lot? Say, you're filling that thing up pretty fast!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I told him I had been in an auto
    accident and was being checked for possible further injuries. I wanted to be friendly,
    because I certainly appreciated his help.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Inwardly, I was mortified. I
    realized I was lying on my back, naked, uncovered, and calmly talking to a strange man
    while I was urinating. Indeed, I was urinating profusely; and he reminded me of this when
    he abruptly told me, &quot;You better shut off your water - this thing's almost full. I'll
    have to empty it and come back. You feel like you have much more?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With some effort, I was able to stop
    my stream. My bladder still was calling for relief, but most of the pain was gone. To Al,
    I replied, &quot;I think I have it stopped - but, yes, I have more in me! Please do come
    back!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He removed the urinal, and looked at
    the gradations. &quot;Gee! You let out almost a quart! And you still got more? No wonder
    you were moaning and squirming! OK, I'll be back in a couple of minutes. Just wait, and
    we'll get you emptied yet!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He took the urinal away to empty it,
    but as before, he left the sheet hung over the railing. He made no effort to cover me. I
    thought of trying to pull it down over my body, but decided to leave it until he returned.
<o:p></o:p>    </span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He was back in a few minutes.
    &quot;Hope you don't mind your pee going into the men's room! I can't very well go into
    the ladies!&quot; he began with a smile. &quot;Now, let's get this thing back in place and
    let you finish emptying yourself!&quot; He placed the urinal again in position, holding it
    against my body with the pressure of his hand. &quot;Now&quot;, he told me, &quot;You can
    open the valves again.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I did. My stream started immediately
    and forcefully. While holding the urinal, he again started surveying my body, his eyes
    falling quickly on my breasts. Somehow, I wanted to tell him, &quot;Please don't
    look!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that didn't seem appropriate
    under the circumstances. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally, my bladder felt empty and
    my stream abated. I indicated I was finished, and he withdrew the urinal. &quot;You
    know&quot;, he said, studying the container, &quot;you had almost a quart and a half in
    you. I wouldn't have thought a lady your size could hold so much. I see why it hurt you so
    badly. Well, I need to go take care of this!&quot; Again, he left with the container but
    failed to cover me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This time I did pull the sheet over
    me. It didn't stay long. When he returned he had a paper towel in hand. He again raised
    the sheet, hanging it on the railing. Then he began to dry my private parts with the
    towel. &quot;Couldn't leave without doing the clean-up job, could I?&quot; he asked, as he
    finished. He discarded the towel in trash receptacle, but stood beside me without making
    any effort to cover me up. I could have done it, but I was really feeling a little
    satisfaction that he was looking at me - no one else had seemed interested. They were, I
    thought, too fascinated with the younger women.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a few minutes of conversation,
    he seemed ready to leave. &quot;Guess it's time for me to get back to business. I'll check
    Dr. Murray's nurse and see if they can get you soon. Want me to cover you up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I suppose you should. I
    shouldn't be lying here with nothing over me,&quot; I answered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He placed the sheet over me, and
    started to leave. Then he came back, raised the sheet and looked at my body again,
    replaced the sheet, and moved away. As he left, he added, &quot;That's so I'll remember
    you for the next time. Incidentally, I don't do this kind of thing as a rule, but I think
    you have nice looking peeing equipment. Your topside's not bad, either. Well - bye,
    now!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now I was really in no hurry to
    leave. My sore foot was still there, but I had received all the treatment I needed for my
    aches and pains - and for my self-esteem!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
