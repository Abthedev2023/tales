    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Between Nancy's junior and senior
    years in college she found a job as a toll collector on one of the state's highways.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy was to attend and occupy a tollbooth at one
    of the least traveled interchanges on the highway system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her position was created to allow
    the permanent and full-time toll takers some vacation time in the summer.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was to come in on Monday, Wednesday and
    Friday from 10:00 AM till 3:00 PM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pay
    was quite handsome compared to the other summertime jobs she had during her college years.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She only had to be in the booth for
    four hours and she had an hour for lunch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was provided with a uniform,
    which consisted of: a smoky gray cotton twill blouse and A-line skirt of gabardine which
    had an inverted center pleat and a dark blue stripe down each side.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy was tickled pink with this job and the
    people she worked with as they welcomed her wholeheartedly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>After going through some training and apprenticing with an older tollbooth
    attendant Nancy was finally allowed to take a tollbooth under her command.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After several days she was
    completely in command and her supervisor said so in no uncertain terms.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy wondered; what could possibly go wrong.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Read on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On Nancy's fifteenth day, in the
    tool booth, she got into trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trouble
    with her bladder, which she sometimes had trouble controlling.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On this day she had checked back onto duty at 1:00
    PM for her afternoon shift, which would end at 3:00 PM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She had used her lunch hour to shop and had ignored the slight swelling in
    her bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she returned to the toll
    plaza she was told to relieve the third booth immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She wanted to protest but realized that any protest would be denied.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she pushed a protest she would be definitely
    fired from his cushy job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When Nancy reported to her booth her
    slightly full bladder began to assert itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
    to worry, thought she, as it is only a couple of hours before I get relieved.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I can wait that long easily.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A half hour later she was in the first
    throes of desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She got on the
    intercom and asked how long it would be before her relief showed up.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shift supervisor advised her that her relief
    would only show up when he was supposed to show up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    didn't push it but she was starting to squirm and fidget.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">By now, an hour later, her distended
    bladder was definitely seeking relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy called again over the intercom
    and asked if it was possible that her relief would be coming in early.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer was an emphatic no.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So far, Nancy had not told the shift supervisor
    that she needed to pee and needed to in the worst way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She simply did not want her supervisor to know that she had neglected to pee
    on her lunch break and that it had been several hours and more than several liquid
    refreshments since she had a chance to relieve herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Nancy was now in the most desperate situation she had ever been in her life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her hands were shaking as she handed
    the customers their change, and quite often she had to stop bouncing up and down on the
    balls of her feet as a customer pulled up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    crossed her legs and stood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pranced
    around the booth like a drum majorette kicking her knees high.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried everything to keep from wetting herself
    but 15 minutes before she was to be relieved she knew it was only a matter of time before
    she wet herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She called over the intercom
    again and was told that her relief may be a little late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy, on the verge of tears, said
    into the intercom &quot;For God's sake, I've gotta pee.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Can't you get somebody out here?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All she heard was, &quot;Hang on relief is on its
    way.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Nancy thought, &quot;Not
    before I make a complete fool of myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She decided that unlike similar
    situations she experienced before she had the advantage of wearing a skirt.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, she had a container, which kept her from
    peeing in the bushes somewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She grabbed the trashcan and pulled
    it to the middle of the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She reached
    under her skirt and pulled the crotch of her panties to one side.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she straddled the trashcan so as to pee into
    it without wetting anything else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While she
    made these preparations she failed to notice that a GMC carryall was approaching.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the carryall stopped with its
    family of four she was still in a straddle legged position over the trash can.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her bladder was screaming for relief.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had gathered as much skirt as possible into
    her right hand and pulled it up out of the firing line (pee stream).<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she took in the twenty-dollar bill from the
    customer she wondered how much he could see of her through the small opening in the
    half-round doors enclosing her booth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She let
    her skirt go and used both hands as usual to make change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she was doing so she completely
    lost bladder control and began to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She peed and peed into the trashcan
    but her skirt was now stretched across her thighs and calves and therefore in the line of
    fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She was wetting the front of her
    skirt, her hose and the trashcan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she
    turned toward the cash register her right leg pushed the trashcan over her left foot where
    it tipped over and soaked her shoes and the floor of the booth.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy managed to give the customer his change and
    wished him a &quot;Good trip&quot; with a forced smile on her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She had peed all over herself, her
    hose, her skirt, and her booth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her shoes
    squished when she moved her feet and her hose showed wet tracks down each leg.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked and didn't see another vehicle
    approaching her booth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She yelled into the
    intercom. &quot;Have my relief bring a mop.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At 3:00 PM sharp her relief showed
    up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He stood shaking his head as Nancy mopped
    the floor with the mop he provided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she
    took the mop and trashcan and headed toward the locker room while her wet skirt and slip
    clung to her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy wanted to crawl into a hole,
    bawl her eyes out, and suck her thumb, but of course, neither of these actions was a
    viable option.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked upright with head
    held high across four lanes to the locker room her wet skirt clinging to every step.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the locker room several others who had been
    relieved looked at her and snickered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    had once again humiliated herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, two
    of the other ladies came up to her and said that the same thing had happened to them when
    they first started and that she shouldn't take it too hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Nancy thought that in all the embarrassment she had gone through she had
    never actually wet her panties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were out
    of the line of fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With that encouraging
    fact in mind she went out and waited for Bruce to drive her home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
