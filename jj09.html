    <br>
    One day I had to go to a business meeting in another town. For this meeting one of my
    female co-workers had to go with me. This co-worker was a close friend of mine; I'll call
    her Amy. Amy and I were kidding around a lot of the time, and my boss tried to let us work
    together as little as possible, for we wouldn't do much at all if we were together all the
    time. We were however, the best people in the business and we had to close this deal. At
    work we had the joy of working with a lot of people, so they were sad to see us go. We
    were going to go away for at least a month.<br>
    <br>
    One day we were going to a meeting and she said she had to pee and asked if she could go
    to the toilet. I told her not to go and she said she had to pee her pants then. I said she
    didn't dare to do that and after she looked at her crotch and her legs she said she didn't
    dare indeed for we had to go to our meeting. She went to the toilet.<br>
    <br>
    I thought that was that but a few days later when we came out of a meeting she made the
    same remark about needing to go. We did the same discussion with me saying she didn't dare
    to pee her pants again. She looked at her legs and crotch and said she didn't dare indeed
    for we still had to go out for dinner. She went to the toilet.<br>
    <br>
    Again a few days later we had the day off and were at the hotel pool. She was wearing a
    black swimsuit and again made the comment about needing to pee. The same discussion with
    me saying she didn't dare to pee her swimsuit. She looked around and under her chair. She
    said she didn't dare indeed for she was afraid anyone could see her pee and got up. She
    jumped in the pool and swam four laps. When she came out she said she didn't have to go
    anymore. Now this was beginning to get interesting.<br>
    <br>
    I must tell you I didn't get into every remark she made about peeing because I didn't want
    it to be too obvious that I was more than kidding. To this day I don't know whether she
    was interested in pee fun herself, or if she found my first reaction strange and decided
    to test me further, or if it was all harmless fun from her point of view.<br>
    <br>
    About a week later at the pool when we were going to our rooms she said she had to go to
    the toilet before we went to lunch, so it would take some more time, if I was willing to
    wait. I said I was famished and didn't want to wait longer than necessary. We were in the
    elevator and she said she'd better pee her swimsuit here then, it would take less time to
    do it now than it would take later. I said she didn't dare to do that and she just smiled.
    Suddenly I heard a hissing sound and her crotch and legs started to glisten. A pool of
    urine formed around her feet and she was finished before we reached our floor. She said
    something like 'yes, I do dare' and winked at me when she went into her room. We changed
    into clothes and went out for dinner, I couldn't get the image of her pissing her swimsuit
    out of my head, and though I'm married I masturbated thinking about it that night and some
    other nights as well.<br>
    <br>
    A few days later when we were on the way back to the hotel Amy said she had to pee bad and
    wanted to walk faster to get there. I sighed and started to walk faster. She said she was
    sorry I had to hurry and I told her I was only kidding. There was nothing else to do if
    she had to pee this bad, now was there? She said she could pee her panties under her skirt
    as well. I said since she didn't dare we had to walk fast, and she asked me- who said she
    didn't dare? I told her to do it then if she dared and she stopped, looked around and took
    me into a quiet ally. She spread her legs and suddenly her piss came cascading down
    between her legs making a big puddle. After she was finished she giggled and said
    something like 'see, I do dare' and winked at me. This was something again for me to wank
    over for a few days.<br>
    <br>
    Later that week we were at the pool again in the sun and she needed to pee. We were
    talking about work and were in the middle of a very difficult formulation of part of the
    deal. I told her I wanted to finish this first because we were writing an almost perfect
    piece now, and we would be out of it when she came back from the toilet. She said she just
    had to go now, and apologised if she embarrassed me and peed her bathing suit sitting in
    the chair. We finished our masterpiece and I started to revel in the memory of her just
    sitting there, peeing herself for all she was worth.<br>
    <br>
    That appeared to be the end of it. We were working very hard on the deal and were more
    times close to a toilet than not. We closed the deal three weeks later, a week sooner than
    expected, and the deal was better than anyone had hoped. We had saved many jobs, kept a
    factory fully operational and it had cost us less than we had expected and got more
    accomplished than we had hoped. We stayed one more day and than went home. When we were in
    the plane Amy went to the toilet but came back without peeing. Apparently the toilets were
    broken. Amy had drunk a lot of water and started to fidget by the time the plane was
    approaching the airport. When the plane had finally landed and we could get out, Amy was
    in trouble. She let everyone get out before her, whispering to me she wasn't sure if she
    could make it. We got out and went looking for the nearest toilet. Suddenly she bent over
    and moaned. Apparently she was in pain. I just asked where the nearest toilets were and
    was told we had to go past customs to get there. Since we were at our destination we
    couldn't go to the tax-free part of the airport to find a toilet there. Amy knew she was
    in trouble for we had to get our bags and then get past the customs for her to get to the
    toilets. That would take an hour at least at this airport and we both knew it. She asked
    me what she was going to do, and I told her she either had to hold it or pee her pants.
    She moaned and asked me if I was going to tell our colleagues if she peed her pants and
    wasn't I going to be mad at her. When I told her not to worry she just let it flow. Her
    pants got soaking wet and she made a big puddle. At that moment one of the flight
    attendants walked by and saw what had happened. She moaned and bent over, holding her
    crotch. She was in trouble as well. Suddenly she spread her legs and a river of pee
    cascaded down between her legs. She said something like wearing skirts was one of the
    advantages of being a flight attendant and walked away fast. I lent Amy my long coat and
    we went through customs without any trouble. Amy changed into something clean in the
    toilets and we have never talked about it since, though I noticed she started to wear
    skirts more often and once she had a lot of fluid in her waste bin. I never know whether
    she used it as a toilet or dumped some water in it.<br>
