    <br>
    <br>
    It was a gorgeous day, simply no other way to put it. The sun was shining, the birds were
    singing, the air was warm and dry, with barely a cloud in the sky. It was the weekend, and
    the faire was the place to be! Games, rides, all sorts of fun! Everyone was there,
    including a girl named Amy. Amy was a darling, sweet girl. She was 5'5, 110 pounds, dark
    just-below-shoulder-length brownish-black hair, beautiful smooth ivory skin, a face that
    had just the right dimension, shade, and skin texture to look like a model, yet not have
    that same air of snobbishness, pert, b-cup breast, and a small, round bottom that went
    down to shapely, skinny legs. She wore a red embroidered spaghetti-strap top with deep-cut
    cleavage, and black dress pants, with some semi-dressy, though comfy shoes- when she went
    out, she went to impress! After purchasing a ticket, she entered the faire, and went to
    try some rides.<br>
    <br>
    Amy was generally a girl without shame. That didn't mean that she was a shameless flirt
    that loved groping guys, or for that matter, girls, whenever anyone was looking, or
    showing herself off for all to see. No, that meant she would talk to nearly anybody,
    didn't mind explaining herself, and wasn't that easily embarrassed. Though, she *was* a
    little naughty, in the sense that she had an affinity for watersports, especially wetting
    her pants. She had never really talked to anyone about it, and had never seen anyone else
    do it, save for looking at wetting sites online. That was actually the reason she wore the
    pants, it was because the material these pants were made of, all that was visible was
    shininess for a moment, then they looked just like dry pants. Well, her time at the faire
    was spent riding rides, and buying drinks, in fact, she had 4 giant cups of coke, and was
    getting a little fidgety... she decided to go wait in line for the restroom.<br>
    <br>
    Many people were in line for the restroom. Amy often went to the restroom, stood in line,
    just so she could get in, and then pee with her pants on, and sometimes masturbate while
    still in the restroom. This line was so long, however, at her stage of desperation, she
    would most likely flood her pants in line. In front of her was someone who looked almost
    as bad off as she was. &quot;I have to go...&quot; said Amy, who was shifting from
    foot-to-foot by now.<br>
    <br>
    The girl in front of her turned around, and Amy was struck by the looks of the girl. She
    was very beautiful, and in fact had most of the same features of Amy, just with slight
    variations, such as blonde hair, not brown. &quot;I know how you feel. I'm bursting to go,
    I waited waaay too long. Now I'm afraid I'll soak my knickers!&quot; says the girl, who
    spoke with a British accent.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm Amy, who are you?&quot; She asked, and the girl replied, smiling,
    &quot;Teresa&quot; she said, and they caught each other's eyes for a moment, before Amy
    said, &quot;Teresa, you know, if we head off somewhere else now, we could try to find a
    private spot, so we aren't so exposed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She noticed Teresa had a skirt on, and Teresa nodded before walking off with Amy. After a
    few minutes, they walked to the corner of the faire, behind a small tent, and Amy says,
    &quot;I can't hold it anymore, Teresa. Do you want to go now? I'm gonna go in my pants...
    someone might see if I pull them down.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Teresa giggled. &quot;If you wanna make your pants wet, go ahead. I'll go through my
    panties!&quot; She said, and squatted, pulling up her skirt. Quickly the crotch of her
    white panties went moist, and then a torrent of urine flowed through them onto the ground.
    Much of the wetness went up the crack of her panties, making her bottom feel warm. Amy
    watched intensely, and she started going as well. A flood gushed into her pants, coursing
    down the legs of her pants, and her own legs, and flowed out her pants cuffs, being
    absorbed by the ground.<br>
    <br>
    Teresa grinned up at Amy and said, &quot;Hey, you want my number?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sure! Here, take mine!&quot; They exchanged numbers... after all- friends are rare
    to come by.<br>
