    Patty looked at her watch and realized she had 10 minutes to catch her train. She could
    not finish the rest of her errands today, nor stop to find a ladies room. Her need to pee
    was not urgent, but she would rather not use the toilet on the train.<br>
    <br>
    Although Patty was pushing 60, she did not look it and was very attractive. She has
    shoulder length dark hair and naturally tanned dark skin and small but perky eyes. Her
    looks are the hallmark of many of the well-off Jewish women in the New York area. Unlike
    many of these women however, she chose to start her own business and not live totally off
    her husband. Being an owner gave her some liberties, like today. Taking the entire day off
    to go to a Broadway Matinee. Her friend had an extra ticket and she would meet her in the
    city. She was dressed smart, but comfortable. A thin black sweater and grey slacks. They
    were snug but not tight and they showed off a figure that any woman her age would be proud
    of.<br>
    <br>
    She slowly made her way to the station as the roads where still snow covered from the
    blizzard last week. As she drove, her need to pee got stronger. As she got to the station
    and parked her car she noticed a lot of people on the platform. Much more than expected
    for a mid morning train. When got to the platform she was told that the trains had been
    delayed all morning due to the weather, Some of the people and been waiting since much
    earlier in the morning.<br>
    <br>
    Patty swallowed as she heard this. Not only did she fear being late for lunch and the
    theater, but also now she really had to pee. It was still not an emergency, but enough for
    her to need to really hold it in with her pee muscles, not just a feeling of discomfort.
    Then an announcement was made that the 10:41 would be at least a half of an hour late due
    to the icing on the tracks. There was a collective moan from the other passengers. Right
    then Patty's bladder must have spasmed, because she now needed to pee so badly, more than
    she had ever felt before. It felt like water out of a fire hose was pressing on her pee
    muscles, very painfully and it was taking all her strength to control it.<br>
    <br>
    She was not crossing her legs or showing any outward signs of desperation yet. Because of
    her local real estate business, many of the people on the platform either knew her or knew
    of her, and she did not want to draw any attention to her self. She stood very still with
    her tights pressed together. Gritting her teeth behind her pressed lips. She was slightly
    bent over with her arms folded and she made very tight fists. Her eyes either had a look
    of panic in them or they were winced shut.<br>
    <br>
    The minutes slowly crept by, as her need to pee was reaching critical levels. She now had
    to visibly cross her legs and press them against her pee hole. She had no choice. The
    urgency was so great. The other people were too wrapped up in their own lateness to worry
    about what she was doing. It was now 11:06 and no sign of any train. She did not know what
    to do. She had to go so badly she wondered how much longer she could hold it in. There was
    a bathroom in the station but she feared the train would come when she was in there.<br>
    <br>
    She could not remember ever having to go so badly. The pee was pressing with all its might
    on her pee muscles. Although she was in great shape for her age, her pelvic region as a
    whole was not what it was. She was not sure how much longer she could hold it and for the
    first time as an adult, she feared she could wet her pants. Only once, stuck in a traffic
    jam in the rain, when she was pregnant did she ever have this feeling before.<br>
    <br>
    Not only was she now crossing her legs, but also she was even more bent over, and jiggling
    and rubbing her thighs together. Again the need to pee got worse and she had to squeeze
    her muscles as hard as she could. As she did, she bent down even further, lifted her head
    up and gritted her teeth with her eyes shut as if she was in pain. When she opened her
    eyes, she looked up at the sky in total fear. She felt she just could not hold her crotch.
    It was totally unthinkable for a woman of her age and stature, even though she was about
    to wet her pants. The shame, fear and agony she was in brought her to tears, which only
    reminded her of the other bodily fluids she was trying to contain.<br>
    <br>
    As she bent down even further, she was hissing through her clenched teeth and constantly
    wincing her eyes shut. Again the need increased. He eyes swelled open again with a look of
    horror, and then she closed them and completely contorted her face. Not only was the
    pressure on her pee muscles agonizing, but also the pain now went up to her bladder and
    her stomach. Only the fear of wetting her pants kept her from doing so. She was beyond
    crying, and she looked like she had been stabbed or was about to give birth.<br>
    <br>
    Finally the train came. Somehow she managed to regain her composure. People were shoving
    their way onto the train and she was in the middle of it all. That was a blessing because
    she could still walk awkwardly with her legs crossed and no one noticed.<br>
    <br>
    She saw a conductor and asked as calmly as she could where the bathroom was. He pointed to
    the end of the car where a line had already developed for the only one on the train. She
    got to the end and stood still, thighs glued together, in more pain, needing to go so
    badly then she could ever imagine. She was standing right next to someone in their seat
    and her pee felt like it would shoot straight out of her and go all over him. Despite
    this, she still would not hold her self or even ask to cut the line. She continued to
    press her thighs until they felt like they would burn. She then wrapped her right leg in
    front of the left, pressing then so tightly around her crotch she could feel her pee
    pressing against her tormented muscle. Her whole vagina was quivering so much that it felt
    like it had changed its shape. Two more people to go and she did not think she could hold
    it in. She again winced her eyes shut as she tried to hold back her tears as well as her
    pee. She had noticed several people whom she knew or who she had done business with. She
    wanted to die. When she was next in line she almost wet her pants. She again pressed her
    thighs together, held her breath and her pee with a strength she did not know she had. It
    felt like a needle was sewing its way through her clenched muscle.<br>
    <br>
    Finally it was her turn. In one motion, she shut and locked the door, dropped her purse
    and finally got to place both hands on her crotch. It offered more control but no relief.
    She carefully took one hand off her crotch, pushed the end of her coat away, hastily undid
    her belt, opened her pants bottom and pulled down her zipper while still holding in an
    urge to pee she could not imagine. She then had take her hand off her crotch, put both
    hands on her side, grip the top of her pants and underwear and yank them down between her
    waist and knees. For a split second she noticed how her fullness and muscle tension made
    her dark pubic hair more noticeable. She sat her self on the toilet seat so hard she
    almost broke it as she let her pee go with so much force it shot back up at her as it hit
    the bottom of the toilet. The relief was so overwhelming she closed her eyes, opened her
    mouth and let out a huge moan of oooaaahhhhhh. Her open mouth soon became a smile. Her pee
    poured and poured, and poured out of her. The stream did not even lose its force let alone
    stop for almost 3 minutes. Before hand she had felt like her world was ending, now she
    felt the world was at peace forever. The agonizing pressure, and the fear of God for
    wetting her pants in both a confined and public place were gone. When she went to wipe
    herself she noticed she was a little wet from the pee hitting the toilet. She wiped her
    wet hair and labia and for a second felt somewhat aroused, but thought little of it.<br>
    <br>
    Patty is a real life woman. She is the mother of two boys I grew up with and a local real
    estate agency owner who sold homes to both of my parents. She is extremely pretty and nice
    but also very high strung and easily stresses out, thus she often looks as if she is
    desperate to pee. She once told me of a horrible train ride to the city and I imagined her
    desperate and thought of this story. I can write more stories about her, or even continue
    her trip.<font color="#000000" face="Arial"><br>
