    Torture During Mass</b></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">I regularly notice during mass that this stunning young girl in the choir
    at St. Stevens Cathedral is shifting around nervously from one foot to the other.
    Especially, towards the end of the hymns and being that St. Stevens is a Catholic church,
    the hymns are sung at periods right through the whole mass, which means that the
    choirmembers have to sit through the whole mass before they can leave their box. Normally
    this doesn't prove to be a problem and the other choristers are rarely inconvenienced by
    this arrangement, even though the masses can sometimes run for 3 hours or more on holidays
    or festivals. However, this poor Irish lass doesn't have the fortitude of her fellow
    choirmembers and this has caused her to become quite nervous and fidgetty at times.<br>
    <br>
    From experience of being a parishioner in the church for over 5 years, I know that she is
    the only one of the 64 choristers to have shown a regular tendancy towards having the urge
    to use the toilet before the end of the mass and even though her bladder would be
    considered normal under other circumstances, I have seen her in a state of heightened
    desperation several times at the end of a long mass.<br>
    <br>
    The most memorable time was during the Mass of St. Patrick (March 17) himself, when the
    choir had made their way around the back for the pulpit from their box and formed an arc
    as each chorister took up their position on the platform. This darling, Marie Rourke, was
    one of the first to take her position and looked luscious in her one-piece choral gown.
    She was 18 and 5'4 foot tall, looked magnificent as her long flowing black hair alighted
    on her shoulders, covering the material of her gown. Her long dark, sleek
    porcelain-skinned feet peeked out beneath her gown. After Marie had been standing on the
    platform for almost an hour after the mass had already been going on for 3 1/3 hours, the
    things suddenly took a very bad turn for her.<br>
    <br>
    Several in the congregation (including me) noticed that Marie appeared to be under some
    strain. She had taken the normal pose, as all the other choristers did, with her long legs
    next to each other, knees slightly bent and with her hands by her side. But after 20
    minutes, she appeared to be shaking and biting on her lower lip from time to time. She
    began to press her upper thighs tightly together beneath her gown in an unnatural
    movement. I saw Marie move her left hand toward her navel. She rested the base of her hand
    on the top of her thigh as she pressed down with her fingers into the soft gown material.
    Marie continued to press her fingers into her navel for several minutes. Nobody else
    seemed to notice what she was doing and that it was apparent that she had to pee very
    badly.<br>
    <br>
    Over the next several minutes later, Marie began to get panicky and I could see that she
    was dying to have a really urgent pee, because she had her feet crossed and her face was
    going red. Suddenly, she looked towards the door to the baptistry and began inching away
    from the rest of the choir, walking in an erratic fashion toward the side of the platform.
    This was when it happened. Marie started peeing in her gown, as she broke into a run
    toward the baptistry door. It became obvious to the congregation, and the priests, that
    pee was running down both her legs and dripping onto the carpet in a torrent. A stream of
    her pee could be seen running over her shoes and splashing onto the carpet. The crotch of
    her white gown became a very dark gray, as she disappeared into the baptistry with one
    hand wedged in her groin.<br>
    <br>
    Marie was given a stern lecture afterwards by the Monsignor in charge of the choir and
    ordered to clean up the platform before spending 2 hours praying for forgiveness. The
    Deacons stated that choristers must have good bladder control in order to belong to the
    choir. Soiling of their clothing was not permitted. Marie was devastated, as she was
    embarrassed infront of the congregation and taken out of the choir for a month. <br>
    <br>
    One of the other female choristers (in her 20s) told to me later that she sometimes also
    was dying to pee during some masses, but made me promise that no one else would ever hear
    about her little secret. This girl, Beth, said that she knows of several incidents where
    she had to wet her panties because the pressure was too much. She also said that another
    chorister had once given her laxatives during the trials for the choir to make her
    uncomfortable on stage. This happened to her when she was 16 and had a sudden urgent need
    to poo during the main hymn. The urge became greater and greater until she no longer could
    control herself. She eventually had to carefully poop her panties and cross her legs.
    Luckily for her, her poo stayed in her panties and left no stain on the back of her gown.
    No-one noticed. Once backstage, she quickly removed her dirty panties and shorts,
    discarding them so she did not stink of poo for the rest of the trials. She is sure that
    she was deliberately slipped a laxative because she has never had to poo so badly, so
    quickly.<br>
    <br>
    Followup to this account: After this incident, Marie was eventually allowed to join the
    choir again, though the Monsignor kept a sharp eye on her for weeks afterwards and would
    cast a stern look at her if she so much as hinted at needing to go to the toilet, which
    happened more than once over that period, but her fear of the wrath of the Monsignor
    seemed to be enough to prevent anymore emergencies.<br>
