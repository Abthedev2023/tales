    <p ALIGN="CENTER">(A completely true incident that occurred in December 2000)<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>The heat was rising in waves off the concrete apron of Adelaide&#146;s&#146; airport as
    we boarded the turboprop driven Lockheed Metro for the flight to Coober Pede &#150; the
    famous opal mining town in the Australian desert, a couple of hundred kilometers south of
    Alice Springs. Twenty-five assorted travelers climbed the two or three steps into the hot
    little cabin of the commuter plane and took their places in one of the two rows of twelve
    single seats that ran on either side of the narrow aisle. The twenty-fifth seat was placed
    in the aisle against the rear bulkhead, making the last row into a threesome.</p>
    <p>In the first pair of seats behind the curtained off flight deck were a middle aged
    Italian couple &#150; urbane and well dressed, he in tasseled loafers and well-cut jacket,
    she in a semi transparent cotton dress. They had talked incessantly at each other at the
    tops of their voices all the way out to the aircraft, and continued to do so inside the
    cabin, their hands contributing as much to the conversation as their voices.
    Disappointedly, I took the second row seat behind the man. As a private pilot, I wanted to
    watch the takeoff over the pilot&#146;s shoulder, but the Italians had made sure they got
    to the front row first, as it afforded slightly more legroom. We Brits are never very good
    as pushing our way to the front! My wife took the place behind the Italian woman and we
    strapped ourselves into the small seats, rather inappropriately covered in sheepskin. </p>
    <p>Behind us sat a rather mismatched couple that had caught my eye as we walked out to the
    plane. He looked as though he might be eastern European, in his forties and rather
    shabbily dressed with over-long unkempt hair thinning on top. His partner was a Chinese
    lady of a similar age, well fed rather than overweight and dressed in brightly patterned
    silk trousers, tightly fitted around her hips. He took the seat behind me, and the woman
    sat across the aisle behind my wife. The other passengers took their places, including a
    young man apparently traveling on his own, who took the twenty-fifth seat in the rear of
    the cabin.</p>
    <p>The plane took off and headed north toward the salt lakes that must have seemed hell on
    earth for the first men to traverse this wilderness. My wife watched the passing scenery
    for a while and then drifted off to sleep, lulled by the incessant drone of the engines. I
    too drifted off and awoke about an hour into the flight, to the sound of a rather agitated
    conversation behind me. I glanced over my right shoulder at the Chinese lady. She was
    sitting quite upright in her seat with an unmistakably recognizable statement on her face.
    Although she had slightly raised her left leg to conceal the fact, I could clearly see
    that her right hand was clamped firmly between her thighs. Without a shadow of a doubt,
    she was desperate for a pee. I had woken just in time to hear her partner reply in a
    tetchy voice, &quot;You&#146;ll just have to wait!&quot; as he half turned away in his
    seat and buried himself deeper in the news. The Chinese lady squeezed her thighs tightly
    together and chewed her bottom lip. </p>
    <p>For the next few minutes, I surreptitiously continued to enjoy the spectacle, until she
    caught my eye. I must have looked as though I might be sympathetic to her plight, for she
    leaned forward across the aisle and touched my shoulder. &quot;What can I do&quot; she
    asked, &quot;I have to go to the bathroom!&quot; My pulse galloped with the delectable
    thought that (a) the plane didn&#146;t have a toilet, and (b) we still had fifty minutes
    to run to our destination. My mind span with the image of her desperately holding herself,
    knowing that it was only a matter of time before she cold hold it no longer, whereupon she
    would flood the sheepskin covered seat and probably the aisle as well.</p>
    <p>I was sympathetic but unhelpful. &quot;There&#146;s not much you can do, I&#146;m
    afraid&quot; I said, trying not to reveal my suppressed excitement, &quot;Can you hold on
    for another fifty minutes?&quot; My voice almost choked with delicious anticipation. The
    Chinese lady couldn&#146;t conceal her desperation as she squirmed in her seat, thighs
    squeezing her hand as tightly as they would go. &quot;I&#146;ve got to go &#150; <i>now</i>!
    Oh! What can I do?&quot; She was almost crying with pain and desperation. Then she said,
    &quot;I&#146;m going to speak to the Captain!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    With that, she undid her seatbelt and stooping under the low cabin roof, pulled aside the
    curtain that divided the cabin from the flight deck. I could see that the first officer
    was rather surprised to find a lady tapping him on the shoulder. I, on the other hand,
    could see her muscles tensing beneath the tight silk of her trousers, as she strove to
    contain herself while she made him aware of her plight. Sadly, the noise of the engines
    made it impossible for me to overhear the conversation, but after a moment or two, the
    first officer squeezed himself out of his seat and came back into the cabin with the
    Chinese lady in tow. As they passed my seat, she spoke into my ear, &quot;He thinks
    he&#146;s got a container in the back&quot; she said quickly. A few moments later, the
    single man who had occupied the twenty-fifth seat came forward and took the Chinese
    lady&#146;s place, closely followed by the first officer on his way back to the cockpit. </p>
    <p>As soon as he was out of the way, the Italian couple &#150; who I guess must have
    grasped what was happening - stopped talking and peered round over their shoulders. This
    was obviously a general signal for the whole plane, and I turned to see twenty-one other
    pairs of eyes trained on the rear of the cabin (my wife had just woken up and had no idea
    what was going on and Chinese lady&#146;s partner stared resolutely into his paper!).
    There was the Chinese lady, whose desperation had clearly overcome all thoughts or
    considerations of modesty. She was squatting, in full view of the spectators, silk
    trousers around her ankles and black lace knickers around her knees, pissing into a large
    plastic container that was balanced precariously on the middle seat. Regrettably, the
    engine noise drowned out what must have sounded like a veritable pressure hose! Eventually
    she finished, and like voyeurs caught illicitly peeping, each of the passengers quickly
    returned to their books and papers (or, in the case of the Italians, their animated
    conversation). The Chinese lady spent the remainder of the flight at the rear of the
    cabin, and I never spoke to her again. As we disembarked, I tried to detect any signs of
    dampness in the silk trousers, but alas they appeared to be quite dry.</p>
    <p>As with all such incidents, there are the inevitable &#145;if onlys&#146;:</p>
    <p><br>
    - If only I had brought my digital camera into the cabin!</p>
    <p>- If only I had been allocated a seat at the rear of the plane!</p>
    <p>- If only the first officer hadn&#146;t had that damn plastic container!<br>
    <br>
