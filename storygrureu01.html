    Ashley was a junior in high school and she was going on a big date with a guy named Josh.
    Really big news in our school, it spread like wildfire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>This to my knowledge happened in less than three hours and the school had
    over 8 hundred students. This was hot news because Ashley was the head of the cheerleading
    squad and Josh was the captain of the football team. Well the fame and popularity of this
    date was skyrocketing by the minute and Ashley was getting nervous because all she heard
    about was how this is going to stake your social reputation for the rest of your high
    school life. She, of course, was stressing real bad and she was drinking pop, water, and
    tea non-stop or so it seemed to her; it only got worse as the big date came closer. You
    see, she was asked out on a Monday and the date was that Saturday. <o:p></o:p></span></font><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Back to our story- she was so
    stressed out by Thursday that she could not function at cheerleading practice.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On Friday the talking did not subside; it seemed
    to get worse. At the football game she was hitting all the wrong moves but no one even
    noticed, the game ended on a high note- the team was lead to victory by Josh. It was a
    shut out 42 - 0. All day Saturday it was non stop water. The time came the date was
    commencing at an Olive Garden restaurant and as they ate she gulped 6 glasses of pop down.
    Then he took her to see a movie and by now she had the urge to pee real bad but she did
    not dare go because of the stories she had heard of girls going to the bathroom during a
    big date. They were social killers; so she held it. 60 minutes later she had her hand in
    her crotch and legs crossed, she was getting very uncomfortable and after another 30
    minutes passed she was bursting and thinking that if the movie didn't end soon she would
    pee her pants. After another 15 minutes passed and she was now rubbing herself non-stop,
    she thought &quot;Oh the pain!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
    even more scared when she felt a small spurt of pee in her pants. Then she realized that
    if he kissed her she was certain to lose control but if she didn't she would be a huge
    social outcast. 5 more minutes passed and he put his arm around her and she felt a 3
    second spurt of pee in her pants, and then a minute later he got closer and closer and at
    the same time he kissed her and put his hand on her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She started peeing; she soaked the seat and there was a big puddle at her
    feet. As soon as she started peeing, he recoiled in disgust. <o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    When the movie was done and they got in the lobby everyone saw her and laughed their heads
    off. One the way home she had to sit on a towel so as not to ruin his car seat.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Halfway home she said apologized to Josh but he
    said nothing in return. Her fate was sealed. She got home and went to her room and cried
    her eyes out.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
