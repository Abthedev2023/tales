    <br>
    Driving on the highway, only 50 mph, and I thought I was going to KILL Tom. He'd started
    bitching a few miles back about getting off the highway to use a bathroom. It kept getting
    worse, and soon he was talking about nothing else.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come ON, Paula, I really have to go! Get over, already!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;YOU make the freaking traffic thin out so I can get over, and I'll get us to a
    bathroom. Dammit, I have to go too!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I was a little cranky.<br>
    <br>
    Trying to navigate on the highway is usually easy, but there had been a ball game, so
    there were about triple the amount of cars as usual, all jockeying for position. We'd been
    stuck in the far left lane for about 5 miles.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Please oh please, get me to a toilet,&quot; whined Tom, as his squirming got worse.
    &quot;I really have to go. I've never had to go this bad.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I really didn't know Tom that well - we had a few of the same classes at the community
    college - but I liked him. He was about 5'11&quot;, a little beefy, but not fat, with a
    round baby face and round glasses to match. His brown hair sure looked soft, and he
    smelled nice. We were always cracking each other up, and flirting. This was our first time
    out together socially, and though the bar was fun (turned out he could dance!), this
    portion of the evening was not going well.<br>
    <br>
    Since I was the designated driver in our little party of two, I'd only had a beer and a
    half, while Tom had downed at least five, without going to the bathroom once. I did have
    to go, but not bad at all. I knew I'd be fine, whenever we got to a restroom. I was
    exaggerating my need, though, to keep Tom company. I kept forgetting to squirm and bitch,
    though. Not that he was noticing.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;C'mon Paula, please, get over. I am NOT going to piss my pants.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Damn right you're not - I just got this car detailed. You ruin my seat; you're
    buying me a new one. You can hold it. Just think about sex. You can't pee if you're hard,
    right?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm beyond that, seriously.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can't you just pinch the top closed?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Christ, you know nothing about men.&quot; But he moved his hand to his lap, and from
    what I could tell, started squeezing his balls. His other hand was gripping the inside of
    the door. I could see that those knuckles were white, even in the dark.<br>
    <br>
    He started looking back over his shoulder ever 2 seconds, looking for a break in traffic,
    and his squirming got worse. &quot;NOW! No, wait. Now, go. No, don't.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tom, if you DON'T stop that, I'm going to smack your ass. I'm NOT going to get us
    killed because you have to pee. Hold it, piss your pants, whatever, but stop freaking me
    out. I think our lives are a little more important than your fucking bladder. God!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    That shut him up for a minute or two, and I was able to move over one lane. Two more to
    go, then we could exit.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sorry, Paula, I really am, I've just never had to piss this bad.&quot; He seemed
    to have a death grip on his balls. He moved his other hand over to squeeze his cock
    through his faded jeans. His brown hair was falling over his face as he scrunched his
    whole body around his bladder. He glanced at me, giving me a glare off his glasses, and
    whined, &quot;Seriously. Please. I won't get us into an accident, but it's getting worse
    by the second.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm really trying, Tommy, but I need you to chill, ok?&quot; I was starting to fear
    that he was going to hurt himself; he was gripping his cock so hard. He couldn't keep his
    hips still, wiggling from side to side, and muttering, 'no please, no please, come on, no
    please' to himself over and over.<br>
    <br>
    We moved over one more lane, but I'm not sure he noticed. He was alternately holding his
    breath and blowing it out hard, and he started rocking back and forth so much that he was
    moving the car a little.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Please don't let me piss my pants, please don't let me piss my pants, PLEASE!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hold on, just a few more minutes, we only have two lanes to go, then we can find a
    fast food place right off the highway.&quot; I was really starting to worry about him. I
    really didn't want him to start crying or anything.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ok, that's good, ok.&quot; He was breathless. He went back to his prayer,
    &quot;please oh please no please come on please no come on,&quot; and then suddenly tensed
    so hard that his ass came off the seat. &quot;NO!&quot; he bellowed, as I changed lanes.
    He scared me so bad that I almost went out of the lane into the car next to us. I decided
    not to yell at him though; I could tell he was in great pain.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's coming out, I can't stop it, it's coming, I'm pissing!&quot; he wailed, as I
    moved to the far right lane. We had a quarter mile to the exit. &quot;No no no no
    NO!!&quot; I stole a glance over and saw a VERY wet spot spreading very slowly. &quot;Grip
    it, Tom, come on! You can stop it!&quot; I really didn't want my seat pissed on. I was
    able to finally move over to the far lane.<br>
    <br>
    He tensed harder than I thought possible, and held his breath. &quot;Come on, stop
    pissing, stop it, stop it, and stop pissing your pants.&quot; After a few minutes of his
    litany, he finally breathed to me, &quot;It's stopped, I stopped, but look, I pissed! And
    now I have to go worse! SHIT! Paula hurry!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    His lap was glistening in the streetlights, and I could tell he had a spot about the size
    of a dinner plate. We reached the exit, and luckily, there was a McDonald's right off the
    highway. Of course, we hit the light right before the McDonald's. I opened my mouth to
    apologize, and looked over at Tom. Even in the dim light I could tell his face was bright
    red. He was holding his breath, his cock, and his balls. As I looked back at the light, I
    caught a glimmer from his lap and knew that his bladder was betraying him again. He began
    to mutter again, &quot;stop stop stop stop pissing stop stop stop it, make it stop.&quot;
    At least it was only still trickling. I thought there might still be hope for my seat.<br>
    <br>
    As we pulled into the parking lot, Tom started freaking out. &quot;I really can't fucking
    stop it! It's just coming out. Why can't I stop it?&quot; He seemed to be fascinated by
    his crotch, he wouldn't or couldn't look away from the spreading wet spot.<br>
    <br>
    I stopped the car, and told him we were there, and he seemed to come out of a trance. He
    looked around, at the other cars in the parking lot, and then looked at me. &quot;I can't
    stop pissing Paula, and I feel like I'm going to explode any minute. I can't get out of
    the car with all these people around. I can't have people seeing me pissing my
    pants.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ok, I'll pull around the back, and you can just unzip and finish pissing, and no one
    will ever know, ok?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I thought he was going to cry with gratitude. I started the car again, and of course had
    to wait while a car went behind us.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;NO!!!&quot; Tom screamed and gripped his cock even harder. The flow was increasing.
    I finally pulled out, and pulled behind the restaurant. Unfortunately, the only place with
    no cars was full of streetlights. I pulled up to the darkest spot I could find, and his
    hand was already on the door handle. As soon as I stopped the car, he opened the door, but
    couldn't move. &quot;Ok, ok, stop pissing. Come on, stop it, come on&quot; he kept trying
    to talk his body into obeying him. Finally he moved one foot out of the car, one hand on
    the door hand, the other still on his soaking wet, dripping cock. He moved his other foot,
    and stood up, facing the inside of the car. He crossed his legs, HARD. He couldn't undo
    his pants with only one hand, but as I reached to help, he yelled, &quot;FUCK! Goddamn it,
    I'm pissing, I'm pissing!&quot; I stared at his crotch as the dam finally burst. Rivers of
    piss started pouring out of the front of his jeans, and all he could do was stand there,
    holding his cock, on hand on the top button of his jeans. The pee poured over his hand,
    wetting his pants from the outside as well as the inside. I was frozen; I didn't know what
    to do. Both of us were silent and still, as his pee exploded out of him.<br>
    <br>
    After what seemed like five minutes, the flow trickled to a stop. He just stood there,
    looking at his hand, still gripping his limp penis.<br>
    <br>
    He uncrossed his legs and finally looked around. Thankfully, there was no one around. I
    didn't know what to say to him, I was sure he was totally embarrassed. I started to reach
    around to the back seat for the blanket I keep there, for him to sit on.<br>
    <br>
    He finally looked at me, gave me a sheepish grin, and said, &quot;That was the best
    feeling I've ever had!&quot; I laughed along with him, relieved that he wasn't going to be
    all dramatic and ashamed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;God these jeans feel heavy, though.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No wonder! They're holding about a gallon of water!&quot; We cracked up.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can sit on this blanket, but I don't know if it's going to keep the moisture
    from my seat.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tell ya what,&quot; he said with a glint in his eye, &quot;why don't I just take
    them off. I'll put them in this bag.&quot; He pulled a plastic bag from the back floor
    seat (I keep bags everywhere; I have dogs).<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That'll work,&quot; I grinned at him. Still looking around, he unzipped his sodden
    jeans and slipped them off, along with his soaked underwear - or maybe he wasn't wearing
    any - I didn't see them, that's for sure. I got a familiar tingle in my crotch, and
    squirmed just a little to push my jeans against my clit.<br>
    <br>
    He peeled his wet clothes off, and wrapped up in the blanket. I decided that I'd hold it
    until we got back to my place. &quot;I'll wash your stuff at my place, ok?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks, that'd be great.&quot; He seemed uncommonly pleased with himself...<br>
    <br>
    As we drove off, my full bladder intensified the tingle between my legs, which was already
    quite sharp, knowing that I had a cute, half naked man just a foot away from me.<br>
    <br>
    As for what happened next...? Tell you later.<br>
