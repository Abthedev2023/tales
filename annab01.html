    <br>
    <br>
    This story is fiction, although it is based on a real event that was mentioned to me a few
    years ago by a friend of the main character- whose name has been changed. The final
    outcome actually happened, but the rest of the story I have made up to fit credibly around
    it, based on what seems likely from what details I was told, and from various experiences
    of my own.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay, well I'll see you on Friday night,&quot; Kylie said to Dale, her new
    boyfriend. They gave each other a quick kiss then left the small inner-city park where
    they'd met for lunch. Dale had to go back to work, but the rest of the afternoon was
    Kylie's to spend as she wished, as she had only casual work, and there would be no more
    for her for the rest of the week. The very first matter on her mind though was to get to a
    toilet. She'd really enjoyed sharing Dale's lunch hour with him, but the two cans of soft
    drink she'd had; one she'd bought herself earlier and a second one that Dale had
    unexpectedly bought her for lunch, were now rapidly filling up her bladder.<br>
    <br>
    In fact as Dale's lunchtime had been nearing its end she'd started frequently checking her
    watch; hoping the time was nearly up, as her bladder was getting very full and
    uncomfortable and she knew she'd have to wee soon. She didn't want to mention it to Dale
    if she could help it though; their relationship was still in the early days and she knew
    she'd feel embarrassed at having to admit that she, a healthy, strong girl of 20, couldn't
    even manage to hold on until the end of his lunch break.<br>
    <br>
    During the last couple of minutes they'd been sitting on the grass together, Kylie had had
    to change position a few times, and even wriggle slightly, hoping Dale was not noticing
    anything. Then when they'd stood up and kissed goodbye she'd had to hold on really hard,
    and it had been her that had ended the kiss so quickly, simply because she'd badly needed
    to move.<br>
    <br>
    Walking provided some degree of relief, but she wasted no time in heading for the railway
    station; the nearest toilets she knew of. When she got there though, she was annoyed to
    find that all the toilets were on the inside of the ticket barrier, and she wasn't ready
    to catch the train home yet. She was short of money too, with the scarcity of work, and
    she really didn't want to have to buy another ticket just so she could go to the toilet.
    She paused, undecided for a few moments, staring in past the ticket barriers, then headed
    away again. Surely it couldn't be too hard to find a public toilet? She wasn't that
    familiar with the city, but did know that there were a few large parks and public gardens
    around, which surely would have toilets in them. Back out on the street she paused briefly
    and looked around to try and get her bearings, then headed in the general direction she
    was sure that she knew there was a large park.<br>
    <br>
    However actually finding one turned out not to be as quick or easy as she had imagined.
    For one thing she couldn't see any signs to any, and also the lunchtime crowds were still
    out in force, making progress slow. As she waited in the midst of a crowd for the traffic
    lights to change so they could cross the road, her need to wee came on very hard and she
    shuffled from one foot to the other to help hold on. Finally the lights changed and they
    started moving, Kylie pushing forward through the mass of people as much as she reasonably
    could. Inevitably though, a few minutes later she had to wait again. She was right at the
    curb this time, but there was no chance of making a quick dash across the road against the
    lights- the traffic was just too constant and heavy. Again as soon as she stopped walking
    her need to pee worsened, and she had to hold back very hard against the sharp pressure in
    her very full bladder. Feeling she was more conspicuous where she was standing this time,
    she tried to restrict herself to standing with one leg bent forward and pressed tightly
    against the other, but within moments she just had to move again, and started repeatedly
    bending her legs alternately back and forth as if she was simply cold.<br>
    <br>
    Ten minutes later Kylie knew she was in trouble. She was dismayed at how quickly her need
    to wee was worsening, and was wishing she'd simply paid the money for a ticket and gone to
    the toilet at the railway station. It was too late to turn back now though; she doubted
    she'd make it back that far in time, and surely she must be nearing a big park by now??
    She came to yet another red &quot;Don't Walk&quot; light and was compelled to stop
    walking. But within moments she was holding on absolutely as tightly as she could manage
    to against the pressure, and couldn't stop moving her legs. For half a minute or so she
    continued to &quot;walk&quot; on the spot, stepping repeatedly from one foot to the other,
    sometimes lifting one leg out at an angle, and making frequent little bobs or curtseys.
    Then, psssst - she felt herself lose a sudden little spurt into her pants, which until
    then she'd managed to keep dry. In a slight panic, she dashed across the first half of the
    road through a gap in the traffic she would normally have considered too small, and found
    herself marooned on the center island, traffic rushing past in both directions. But
    despite the little bit she'd just done, if anything her desperation now became worse - the
    pressure seemed overwhelmingly strong and she could feel slight lapses happening in the
    tightness of her sphincter.<br>
    <br>
    She felt very close to completely losing control. Then sure enough, PSSSSSSST! She spurted
    again; longer, and heavier than the first one, and in desperation she thrust her hand
    between her legs and clamped her fingers tightly onto her outlet, dancing and squirming
    like a little girl. Close to tears, she was mortified at what she was doing in plain view
    of so many people, but it was better than totally wetting herself in front of them, and
    she tried to reassure herself that at least no one knew her here in the city anyway.<br>
    <br>
    The lights finally changed and she managed to hold on properly then for a couple of
    minutes as she hurried along, changing direction whenever she came to a Don't Walk light,
    just so she could keep walking. She saw some steps heading downward off to the side, and
    decided to follow them. Maybe she'd find a reasonably secluded laneway or back doorway or
    somewhere she could pee. As she half leapt down the first two steps in one go she suddenly
    did another spurt, and as she neared the bottom she could feel her control faltering
    again. There was no one coming her way so she held herself again to try to ward it off,
    but it was no surprise to her when more forced its way out anyway. Before pulling her hand
    away she felt the crutch of her denim shorts, and could now feel a definite wet patch
    there. She wasn't game enough to check though, as there were now more people coming in her
    direction.<br>
    <br>
    Still following her rather vague sense of where she should be heading, as soon as there
    was enough of a break in the traffic she stepped down off the footpath to cross the road,
    but this street was rather old. Just stepping down from the unusually high curb was too
    much for the now quite precarious hold she had on her overfull bladder, and more wee
    abruptly squirted out into her pants and shorts. She ran a few steps, but the jolting made
    the discomfort of her heavy, stretched bladder in her belly even worse, and almost made
    her lose control completely.<br>
    <br>
    Then at last as she headed down another street, Kylie saw ahead what she had been longing
    to see: trees. That meant a park of some kind, and hopefully it would be big enough to
    have toilets. She longed to run, but knew it wouldn't be wise. She fought down the urge to
    hold herself as the urge to wee worsened again with anticipation, but grimly held on as
    tightly as she could possibly manage, ignoring the feelings of imminent loss of control.<br>
    <br>
    As she came closer, she saw with relief that it was indeed a park, and probably quite a
    decent sized one, which surely should have some toilets. It was all she could do not to
    start weeing then and there as she hurried along, and she was sure people were looking at
    the urgent, awkward way she was walking. She avoided looking anyone in the eye though,
    keeping her gaze fixed straight ahead. She knew the wet patch around the crutch of her
    shorts must surely be visible to anyone who looked by now. At the entrance to the park she
    had to slow right down and maneuver her way through a group of people standing around,
    then as she put the pace on again she accidentally let go another large spurt, which she
    knew she'd barely managed to stop.<br>
    <br>
    This time she felt a dribble run down one leg, and she rubbed her legs against each other
    as she walked to hide it.<br>
    <br>
    Her anxiously searching eyes found a small brick building ahead, which had to be a toilet.
    Relief was in sight at last! Half a minute more, she told herself- if she could just hold
    on for half a minute longer...<br>
    <br>
    She hurried around the corner of the building, knowing she was only moments away from
    relief - and came face to face with a locked gate and a sign saying &quot;OUT OF ORDER.
    USE TOILETS AT OTHER END OF PARK.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    With a little whimper she clutched herself between her legs and turned to try and see
    where the other toilets might be, but before she'd managed to take more than a couple of
    steps she felt her failing control give way completely, and the wee start gushing out of
    her, totally out of control. She grabbed with both hands and tried desperately to tighten
    up enough to stop the flow, but it felt as hopeless as trying to stop a rolling car with
    one finger, and in moments she gave up, stopped struggling and squatted down where she
    was. At least it wouldn't soak her shoes that way.<br>
    <br>
    When it finally stopped she looked gingerly around and then stood up. There was no one
    close by. No one had seen her! What luck! She looked at the huge puddle running slowly
    away from where she stood, then down at the very obvious wet area in her shorts.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I pissed myself... I actually pissed myself!&quot; she murmured to herself in
    bewilderment- half crying and half laughing. It had been many, many years since she'd
    totally wet her pants like this; it hadn't been something she'd ever really contemplated
    happening again. Yet now that it had happened...<br>
    <br>
    She felt a strangely exciting sense of freedom and relief, that was more than just the
    physical relief of a bladder no longer bursting, and began to laugh outright. What did it
    matter if her shorts were soaked? She had plenty of time, and if she lay down in the warm
    sunshine they'd soon dry. She walked nonchalantly away, grinning at the puddle she'd left
    behind outside the locked toilet, and wondering if anyone would come across it before it
    dried off too.<br>
