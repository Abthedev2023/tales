     Laura's 
      Story<br>
    </strong>
    </font><br><br>It all began one warm summers day during the college vacation, when my 
      parents were away and I had the house to myself. One fine Saturday I 
      relaxed on a plastic sun lounger on our very secluded patio with a rather 
      raunchy book. It was hot, and to slake my thirst I had been drinking large 
      quantities of mineral water. The sexy goings on in the book made me quite 
      randy and I frequently rubbed myself between my legs, knowing that I would 
      make myself come eventually but enjoying the long slow build-up.<br><br>After a while I realised that my bladder was filling but was simply too 
      comfortable, and too lazy, to get up and use the toilet. Before long I was 
      getting quite desperate, rubbing and holding myself to avoid an accident. 
      Eventually I knew I would just have to go to the loo or I was going to wet 
      my knickers as I lay there. I put my book down and sat up but needed to 
      wee even more than I had realised. The extra pressure on my distended 
      bladder overcame my muscle power and hot jet of wee spurted into my pants 
      as I looked in surprise at the large wet spot spreading in the crotch of 
      my pale blue shorts. I managed to regain control by squeezing tight and 
      holding myself.<br><br>But, as I pushed hard on my pussy I came, and promptly lost all 
      control. Slumping back on the lounger I just let it come, not that I could 
      stop it, and just lay there with a hot, wet stream pouring into my 
      knickers, soaking my shorts and the towel on which I was lying and 
      dripping onto the patio beneath me. Reaching down to feel the state of my 
      shorts and underwear I brought myself off again almost without intending 
      to. Just touching myself through my wet clothes was enough to to it. I had 
      never experienced anything like it. I hadn't wet myself for a long time, 
      not since I got drunk at a party and had an accident in my pants on the 
      way home. That time I was just embarrassed.<br><br>I lay back totally relaxed and made no attempt to go and change. Why 
      bother when no-one could see me and I had the house to myself. Dozing for 
      a while I eventually went back to my book. Of course, with all the water I 
      had drunk I needed to wee again after a while. The warm sun had helped me 
      dry off quite a lot but I was still rather damp so I thought what the 
      hell, my clothes need washing anyway so I might just as well wet myself 
      again. The thought of doing it deliberately sent a shiver through me and I 
      decided to hold on till I burst. The more desperate I became the more I 
      teased and pressed on my bladder, causing little spurts to trickle into my 
      knickers. After a few minutes of this I just relaxed and let it flow, 
      relishing the hot flood tickling my bottom and soaking my shorts. It 
      certainly felt good.<br><br>I lay there for a while before bathing and changing, putting on a black 
      mini-skirt, pink satin knickers and white tights before walking to the pub 
      to meet my friends. After a good evening I deliberately refrained from 
      using the loo before I left. With a rather full bladder I began the half 
      hour stroll home, knowing that I might just have another "accident" before 
      I got there.<br><br>I walked slowly, enjoying my fullness, but nervous that I might be seen 
      by other people if the dam burst too publicly. In the event my social 
      conditioning must have kicked in because although I kept leaking little 
      trickles I didn't lose control completely. By the time I reached home my 
      knickers and tights were comfortably wet but I was still bursting as I 
      reached the porch and searched for my key. Deliberately relaxing my 
      muscles I savoured the hot wetness that filled my knickers before finding 
      its way through my tights and down my legs. It felt wonderful and as the 
      flood died away I squeezed my legs together, coming, as the last of the 
      warmth dribbled down my thighs.<br><br>Once indoors I checked myself out in the mirror. The wet streaks down 
      my legs clearly showed what I had done but the black skirt hid my wet 
      bottom. If this had happened in public simply taking off my tights would 
      have kept my accident a secret between me and my knickers. This gave me 
      several ideas!<br><br>Feeling very naughty I kept my wet pants and tights on when I went to 
      bed, wetting them again sat on the toilet before I did so - I was worried 
      that I might wet my bed. I woke up early, bursting to go and almost let it 
      happen but did not want to damage the mattress. As I sat on the loo, again 
      emptying myself through my knickers, I suddenly remembered the spare bed. 
      We had put waterproof covers on the mattress and quilt when my sister?s 
      young child had come to stay. Later that day I removed them and put them 
      on my own bed, a good thick towel between the sheet and the plastic cover, 
      feeling a definite excitement as I did so.<br><br>I spent the day at home, catching up on washing - and creating more on 
      two occasions when it was just too much trouble to go to the bathroom. 
      That night I went to bed wearing knickers beneath my pyjamas, having drunk 
      several glasses of water and with an already filling bladder.<br><br>Would I have an accident in my sleep?<br><br>Waking with an aching bladder some time later I tried to ignore it and 
      managed to drift back to sleep. I awoke from a dream in which I had been 
      desperate for the loo and had just found one in time, thinking I was 
      sitting there feeling that wonderful release. A warm wetness slowly 
      enveloped by bottom and I made no attempt to stop the long spurts of wee 
      as I lay there half asleep, wetting my bed like a naughty child. I must 
      have gone back to sleep because the next thing I recall was my alarm 
      clock. I felt a comfortable warm wetness all around me and didn't quite 
      realise at first that I had actually wet the bed. Then I remembered my 
      dream and those feelings of release. I threw back the covers and inspected 
      my wet night clothes and the huge wet patch on the sheet. I needed to wee 
      again and simply let go, adding to the puddle under my bottom and once 
      again rubbing myself to a climax.<br><br>Over the next couple of weeks while I had the house to myself my 
      knickers were rarely dry and I wet my bed almost every night, several 
      times totally by accident. Now, back in my little flat the bed is well 
      protected - a good job too as I don't seem to have the control I used to, 
      and seem to wet the bed by accident, often once or twice a week, usually 
      when I dream about wetting my knickers, something I also do regularly. 
<br><br>I seem to have become a rather wet girl!<br><br>
