    </font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Each time there was a party on
    campus, one of the sorority members had the duty to stay in the dorm to ensure security
    and to open the door for fellow members who came home. This night, the victim was Cathy,
    not exactly one of the more popular girls although she was quite attractive, but her
    general attitude and interest in sports (she was on the hockey team) made the other girls
    have doubts about her sexual preferences. Cathy woke up in the middle of the night. She
    was certain she had heard something: a loud sound, like someone banging on the plumbing.
    None of the other girls had come home yet, and although she always had a butch exterior,
    she was just as scared as anyone else on the inside. Cathy turned over in her bed, but she
    had the same problem she always had when waking up; even if she woke up in the middle of
    the night, she had to do her morning pee. Cathy tried to go back to sleep, but her swollen
    bladder was pounding against the elastic band on her cotton panties.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She decided to hold it, however, and turned over
    again to try and find a position that would ease her discomfort. Then, a second thump was
    heard, this one louder and closer than the last. Cathy jumped up in fear; she let out a
    muffled scream and, what really made her heart thump faster and harder, she felt a small
    squirt escape into her panties. She had pressed her bare thighs together instantly, and
    sat there trembling; carefully, she lifted the sheets and spread her legs. She looked
    desperately into her crotch, but saw only a small wet patch on her white panties; her
    sheets were unsoiled. Quickly, she closed her legs again; her accident was only small, but
    she still had to go to the bathroom real bad! With one swift movement, Cathy jumped out of
    bed. That turned out to be a bad idea: standing up straight, her struggling bladder now
    had gravity's help. Cathy crossed her legs tightly, to prevent any more from leaking out,
    and tiptoed out of her room. That didn't turn out to be such a bright idea either. With
    her bare feet touching the cold tile floor, her bladder seemed even more eager to relieve
    itself. Cathy grabbed her crotch tightly with one hand; it was the only thing she could do
    to hold back the flood. Trembling, she turned on the lights to the corridor. She cursed
    under her breath; she felt like a little girl again, too scared to go to the bathroom and
    wetting herself. But she wouldn't let it come to that. Carefully she tiptoed towards the
    bathroom when suddenly the doorbell rang. Cathy cursed once more. She was in desperate
    need now, but it was her duty to answer the door when one of her sorority sisters came
    calling - and she wouldn't forsake her duty. Subtly, she pulled her T-shirt over her
    panties and ran towards the front door; at least she wouldn't be so scared when some of
    the other girls were here. She opened the door, and saw two girls standing there, who were
    not members of her sorority.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hi, I'm Laurie,&quot; said one
    of them, &quot;this is my friend Kitty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy noticed that Kitty couldn't
    stand still, obviously from an overly full bladder, and she also saw a huge wet patch on
    the front of her jeans; Kitty was dancing around with her legs wide apart, because
    otherwise they would stick together, she was too disgusted to hold her crotch although she
    was almost peeing in her pants again, and crying softly out of desperation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can I PLEASE use your
    bathroom?&quot; She pleaded, &quot;I really can't wait any longer!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It looks like you already used
    the bathroom,&quot; Cathy remarked; she uncrossed and crossed her legs again, barely able
    to stand still herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;She had a little
    accident,&quot; Laurie excused her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please,&quot; Kitty pleaded,
    &quot;I really have to go!!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Alright,&quot; Cathy yielded,
    &quot;it's the last door down the hall. But don't make a mess in there!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty ran down the hall faster than
    ever. She opened the last door, but took a step back when she saw exactly the same thing
    she saw in the biology building: the toilet was totally destroyed, water was spraying in
    every direction out of the floor and walls.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Laurie!&quot; Kitty screamed,
    &quot;it's happening again! It's the monster again!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Monster?&quot; Cathy asked
    puzzled, &quot;what's going on here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty closed the door to the
    bathroom again, and ran back into the hallway.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's too weird to
    explain,&quot; Laurie said, only to be cut off by Kitty.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please,&quot; she pleaded to
    Cathy, &quot;don't you have a bucket or a pot or something I can pee in? I'm going to do
    it right here if I don't go NOW!!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure, in the kitchen,&quot;
    Cathy became increasingly nervous, not in the least because she was desperate for a toilet
    herself, &quot;it's over there!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kitty ran into the kitchen and
    started looking for a way to relieve herself- followed by Cathy and Laurie. Cathy opened a
    cupboard under the sink and took a large, plastic bucket out; Kitty wrestled with her wet
    jeans to get it out, but pulled it down to her knees and planted her soaking wet buttocks
    on the rim of the bucket. Cathy and Laurie looked at her, but nothing happened.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can't go with you
    watching,&quot; Kitty said, &quot;can't you turn around?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You had no problem going
    earlier,&quot; Laurie commented, &quot;and you didn't even take off your pants for that
    one!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I was scared, okay!&quot;
    Kitty snapped, &quot;now please turn around!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Okay, just hurry up!&quot;
    Cathy said, hopping from one foot to the other. Both girls turned around, and still
    nothing happened. After a few seconds, they heard a soft hissing sound, growing louder and
    stronger. Cathy had to grab her crotch with both hands not to wet herself there and then;
    Laurie, too, started to dance around. Then, the three girls were startled half to death by
    an explosion from behind them; it was like the sink itself had exploded, and where it
    stood a minute ago, now stood the same creature Kitty and Laurie had seen in the biology
    building, towering over them, drooling and howling in a way only animals could. Kitty and
    her bucket both fell over, her pee spreading all over the floor. Cathy turned around and
    screamed in terror, feeling her sphincter muscles numbing; Laurie took her arm and ran out
    the kitchen, Kitty stumbled to her feet and with her pants around her ankles, hopped out
    too. As Laurie closed the door behind her friend, Cathy fell flat on her butt and just
    kept on peeing and peeing; she cried softly, now she actually felt herself losing control.
    Cathy grabbed her panties through her T-shirt, but only felt the warm flood flowing
    through her fingers; she sat in a thick, yellow puddle, that kept growing as her bladder
    was emptied in a loud, hissing beam of pee that made her way through her panties, down her
    thighs and into her butt crack.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We have to get out of
    here!&quot; Kitty screamed as she pulled up her wet pants again, &quot;It's chasing us,
    can't you see!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come on!&quot; Laurie tried to
    pull Cathy up, &quot;you're a sitting duck here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm peeing in my pants,&quot;
    Cathy cried; as she stood up straight, the pee kept on streaming down her legs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yeah, I've peed my pants
    too,&quot; Kitty said, &quot;now get out of here before you lose more than just bladder
    control!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie and Kitty ran outside with
    Cathy in their wake; she had completely emptied her large bladder now, walking with her
    legs spread wide, her white cotton panties yellow with pee and large wet stains on the
    front and the back of her T-shirt. The three girls jumped into Laurie's jeep and drove off
    once more.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Where are we going?&quot;
    Cathy cried softly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Back to our dorm,&quot; Laurie
    answered, &quot;do you still have to go, Kitty?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kitty admitted,
    &quot;although I guess I could just as well pee in my pants now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't do that!&quot; Laurie
    screamed, &quot;my car is dirty enough already! And also- I have to go pretty bad too,
    now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">TO BE CONTINUED.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
