    <br>
    Fiona took another sip of her gin and tonic before putting the finishing touches to her
    make-up, then rose from the dressing table.&nbsp; She stepped into her tailored, powder
    blue skirt, pulling it up and fastening the zip.&nbsp; It was going to be warm at the
    wedding and she decided to dispense with the blouse and donned her matching jacket,
    buttoning it over the swell of her full breasts and the delightfully deep cleavage created
    by her lacy half bra.&nbsp; Blue court shoes and a broad brimmed straw hat with long,
    trailing ribbon completed her wedding ensemble.&nbsp; She stood in front of the long
    mirror in her bedroom, smoothing down the short, straight skirt and liked what she saw: at
    36 she was looking good - her waist still trim, full hips and a neat bum, long classy legs
    in their tan stockings and those gorgeously beautiful, firm tits.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    She drained her glass, enjoying the spreading glow in her stomach from the gin and looked
    again in the mirror.&nbsp; She had not worn such a short skirt before, but the fashion
    trend in the early '60s was for shorter and shorter hemlines and young girls, like her
    daughter Gemma, who was 18, were now wearing them indecently short.&nbsp; She smiled at
    her reflection and picking up her gloves and handbag she went downstairs to the drawing
    room where she poured another gin, tinkling the ice into the glass, watching the fizzy
    bubbles from the tonic hissing to the surface.&nbsp; She turned as her daughter entered
    the room.&nbsp; &quot;Oh darling!&nbsp; You look quite beautiful,&quot; she exclaimed and
    Gemma gave her a mock curtsy.&nbsp; &quot;Thank you, mummy.&nbsp; Oh you are becoming
    daring,&quot; as she looked at the length of her mother's skirt.<o:p></o:p></span></font><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;In your case,&quot; Fiona
    replied, &quot;it's not daring; it's positively lewd.&nbsp; Bend over and you'll show off
    your panties to the world.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Don't be silly, mummy,&quot; and Gemma
    giggled, &quot;Anyway I'm wearing tights, so no one's going to see anything.&quot;
    &nbsp; She took a long drink from the glass of coke she was holding.&nbsp; Her summer
    dress was certainly very short, with a full swirling skirt and it had taken a certain
    degree of courage to decide to wear it, but she knew that it would attract the right sort
    of attention.&nbsp; Having very recently discovered the delights of fucking she was more
    than keen to drop her panties if the opportunity arose, which it might well do at the
    wedding.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fiona sat down on the sofa, sipping
    her G&amp;T and checked the contents of her handbag: cigarettes and lighter, money,
    make-up and a pack of five Durex rubbers. She smiled to herself &nbsp;- well the
    Cavendishes were a randy family and there would be lots of them at the wedding, so you
    never could tell what might happen, and with her own husband, Rear Admiral Sir Donald
    Drummond, away in the Far East for eleven months, Fiona was more than a bit horny herself.
    &nbsp; She looked at her watch, just time for a quick cigarette, finish her drink and go
    for a pee before the car was due to pick them up. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Gemma finished her drink and took a
    cigarette from her mother. Should she have another drink before the car came?&nbsp; She
    rose and crossed the room to the drinks trolley where she poured another coke over some
    ice and added a generous dash of vodka while her mother wasn't looking and took a long
    swallow, enjoying the spreading warmth in her stomach from the alcohol. She was suddenly
    conscious of the need for a pee but decided to finish her cigarette first and crossed to
    the window, looking out onto the drive in front of the house. She took another swallow of
    her drink and crossed her legs, exerting the mildest pressure on her pee hole and then
    noticed the car coming up the drive.&nbsp; &quot;There's the car, she said,&nbsp; &quot;It
    must be early and I must go for a pee before we leave.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Oh come on,&quot;
    her mother replied, putting on her hat and picking up her handbag and gloves, &quot;We can
    go at the vicarage when we collect Ruth and Christina.&quot;&nbsp; She drained her glass
    and Gemma followed suit.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They went out into the sunshine of a
    beautiful English summer and the driver touched his cap,&quot; Good afternoon Lady
    Drummond, afternoon miss,&quot; as he opened the doors for them.&nbsp; Conscious of the
    shortness of her skirt Fiona stepped carefully into the car and sat down, nevertheless
    giving the driver a eyeful of long legs, and stocking tops as she did so.&nbsp; Gemma
    settled herself beside her mother, smoothing down her dress and balancing her hat on her
    lap.&nbsp; Two minutes later they were turning into the vicarage drive.&nbsp; Ruth
    Rutherford, the vicar's wife and her 18 year old daughter Christina were seated on a
    garden bench on the lawn waiting for them, drinking Martinis from a large glass jug.
    &nbsp; &quot;National emergency,&quot; Fiona laughed as they got out of the car,
    &quot;We're both absolutely desperate.&nbsp; Can we use the loo?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Oh
    dear,&quot; Ruth replied, &quot;Edwin has gone off with my keys to the house.&nbsp; He's
    doing a Christening at St Stephen's and we can't get back in.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Fiona
    responded, &quot;Now what do we do?&quot; and she cast an anxious look around the garden,
    but there was no cover, only a wide expanse of lawn and their driver was standing
    watching.&nbsp; No matter where they went, he would see and then the story would be all
    over the village.&nbsp; They went over to the bench and sat down at the table. Fiona
    crossed her legs tightly and noticed that her daughter had done the same.&nbsp; Ruth and
    Christina finished their drinks.&nbsp; &quot;Can't you last until we get to the
    wedding?&quot;&nbsp; Ruth asked anxiously. &quot;I know that Sir Michael was arranging
    lots of extra toilets beside the house because there were so many people coming to the
    wedding.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;We don't have much bloody choice,&quot; Fiona replied.
    &nbsp; &quot;Do you think you can last out darling?&quot; she whispered to Gemma, who
    grimaced.&nbsp; &quot;Oh I don't know, really I don't, but the sooner we go the
    better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They rose and made for the car and a
    minute later were turning on to the narrow country road leading to the village of
    Northmere where Sir Michael Cavendish had his large house.&nbsp; The road turned and
    twisted up through the forest, each corner and bump increasing the problem for the ladies.
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oh God, I wish we'd gone before we left,&quot; Gemma whispered to her
    mother as the car hit another hollow in the road, forcing her down hard into the seat and
    sending a shock wave up through her buttocks directly to her bladder. She bit her lip,
    clenching her thighs together and pushed her fist hard, down into her groin, praying that
    the driver wouldn't notice.&nbsp; Her mother gave a weak smile in return, concentrating
    all her attention on the increasing demand from her bladder for relief.&nbsp; Only another
    ten minutes, she thought, and they would be there.&nbsp; Surely nothing else could go
    wrong!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She tried to sidetrack her brain,
    bending forward to talk to Ruth, who was in the front seat and, like Gemma, she pushed her
    fist down between her thighs under the cover of the hat on her lap, under her skirt and
    up.&nbsp; She pressed hard through the crotch of her panties, noticing that Ruth now had
    her legs tightly crossed as well.&nbsp; &quot;How many people are expected at the
    wedding?&quot; she asked, as Ruth turned her head towards her.&nbsp; &quot;Between two and
    three hundred, I believe,&quot; she replied and then noticed where Fiona's hand had
    disappeared. &quot;Oh dear, is it that bad?&quot; she whispered, &quot;Or are you just
    having a quick feel to get you in the mood?&quot;&nbsp; Fiona managed to raise a weak
    smile, &quot;Don't make me laugh. It's painful enough without that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The car was out of the trees and
    dropping down to the village. It slowed for the turning to the narrow road leading to Sir
    Michael's mansion and joined a queue of cars waiting to pass a lorry with a large trailer,
    stopped at the side of the road.&nbsp; &quot;Oh no!&quot; Fiona exclaimed as she read the
    words emblazoned along the side of the trailer, &quot;Loos-R-Us.&quot;&nbsp; The vehicle
    was loaded with portable toilets.&nbsp; Surely fate could not be so cruel!&nbsp; A cloud
    of steam was rising from the front of the lorry and as they drew level, they could see a
    thin fountain of hot, steaming water jetting out from the radiator. A disconsolate driver
    was standing on the road watching a growing pool of yellow, rusty water spreading slowly
    towards him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The passengers in the taxi stared
    open-mouthed as they inched past the lorry, each one of them acutely conscious of the
    images of the steaming puddle, of the arcing spray of water and of the mounting bladder
    pressures which they were all feeling.&nbsp; The fountain died suddenly to a limp trickle
    as they passed and Gemma looked in consternation at her mother. &quot; What do we do
    now?&quot; she asked. &quot;Oh God!&nbsp; I can't last much longer. Oh, really I can't. I
    don't know what to do.&quot;&nbsp; She was bent forward in the seat, almost doubled up,
    her legs tightly crossed, fighting against the demand for relief from her swollen bladder
    and the thought of the total humiliation if she let go.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For Ruth and Christina the problem
    wasn't quite so pressing, though both now needed to go fairly urgently and Ruth tried to
    calm things down.&nbsp; &quot;It's only another minute,&quot; she urged, &quot;We'll find
    some place as soon as we get out of the car.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The taxi was now approaching the
    entrance to the grounds of Northmere Hall and they turned through the gate.&nbsp; Cars
    were parked along one side of the drive for the whole of its length and they drove slowly
    towards the house.&nbsp; The parking area in front of the house was packed with cars and
    there was barely room for the taxi to turn.&nbsp; They clambered out, clutching hats and
    handbags, stretching their legs and enjoying the sudden freedom of movement, which seemed
    to help with their predicament, even if only temporarily.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There were people everywhere,
    getting out of cars, milling about, greeting each other with effusive kisses and again
    this acted as a temporary and welcome distraction.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On the lawn, in front of the house,
    two gigantic marquees had been erected, one set out with tables for the meal and the other
    with a bar, a small band and an area for dancing.&nbsp; The wedding ceremony itself was to
    be held in the open and seating had been arranged on the grass. The Catering staff was
    circulating with trays of drinks and champagne corks were popping.&nbsp; Not for nothing
    was Sir Michael the owner of one of the largest breweries in the country as well as a
    chain of public houses and wine shops and no expense had been spared in the provision of
    liquid refreshment for the guests.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was also clear that all was not
    well.&nbsp; The normally urbane and unflappable Sir Michael was pacing angrily up and down
    in front of the house.&nbsp; Not only had the toilets not arrived but he had also just
    been informed of another and equally serious crisis.&nbsp; &quot;What the fuck was he
    going to do?&quot;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">An engine roared into life behind
    him and he turned to find that the lorry, which had delivered the contents of the bar, was
    just leaving.&nbsp; It moved slowly between parked cars, making for the driveway and,
    blissfully unaware of yet another impending catastrophe, Michael rushed into the house to
    find out what had gone wrong there.&nbsp; Jane, his PA, who had brought him the bad news,
    followed him.&nbsp; She had been on the go since early morning and had scarcely had time
    to draw breath; mugs of coffee, a couple of cokes and then some champagne, all on an empty
    stomach and with no time to go to the loo, had left her with a bulging bladder, sore feet
    and now, the worst possible news for her boss.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What do you mean, there's no
    water?&quot; he had almost snarled at her. &quot;There must be water.&quot;&nbsp; But
    already there was the slow dawn of realization in his mind.&nbsp; There were workmen at
    the back of the house trying to locate the main water pipe into the house, ready for the
    next stage of renovations due to start after the wedding.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Not a lot of pee so far.
