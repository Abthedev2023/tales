    <br>
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As you might
    know, I usually try not to show desperation when I am in that state.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why, but letting others know I have
    to pee badly is just something that never came easy to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I can't even let Chris, my long-standing significant other; know when I'm
    bursting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I try to act like nothing is wrong.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are times however, when desperation simply
    cannot be hidden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This story is about one of
    those times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since this took place last
    weekend, the cat is out of the bag and Chris knows that holding a very full bladder, or
    better yet, watching him hold a very full bladder turns me on.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He wasn't surprised!<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Twice yearly we run a spiritual retreat in a rustic lodge in the woods.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a beautiful place with a large kitchen, a
    sitting room with a nice fireplace, and rooms upstairs with dorm-style bunk beds.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For all its quaintness, there is one little
    problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is only one bathroom, which
    consists of a sink, bowl, and shower. The bathroom is for both men and women.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is never a big problem since there are only
    about 10 of us there at a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For me
    though, it became a problem last weekend.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Since Chris and I run the retreat, we are usually the first ones up in the morning, so
    there is never a line for the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I let
    him go first, and then I go long before the others arise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Last weekend however, I heard Chris get up, mumble something about us going
    downstairs to put on coffee for the guests, and that I should be getting up.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was exhausted and just couldn't comply.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris told me he was going to shower and come back
    to wake me in 10 minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When he came back
    in, I still felt groggy and rolled back over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    was aware of the fact that I needed to use the bathroom, but I was more tired than
    desperate and chose to go back to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris
    decided to show me some mercy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said he'd
    go downstairs and put the coffee on and make sure the fire was started in the fireplace.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He told me he'd be up to get me in a half hour.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was delighted with the thought of sleeping an
    extra 30 minutes, and fell into a deep sleep.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    When Chris came back in to wake me up, I was aware of the guests stumbling about in the
    hallway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris had a cup of coffee in his
    hand and offered it to me as soon as I put my feet on the floor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I welcomed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Surely coffee would wake me up!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    drank the entire cup and slipped on my jeans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    we left our room there were three people in line waiting for the bathroom, shower, or
    both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I decided to go downstairs with Chris
    and get breakfast started.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some guests had
    already gathered in the sitting room, and by the look of their wet heads, I knew they had
    already used the shower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris and I began
    slicing bagels and arranging fruit on platters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    was 8AM and our seminar was due to start at 9:30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    poured myself a second cup of coffee, knowing full well that my bladder was very full. I
    wasn't bursting and didn't foresee a problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd
    drink the coffee and head upstairs to the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    telling Chris that I was going to shower and that I'd be back in ten minutes, I headed
    upstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The same people were still on line
    waiting to get into the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seemed
    that the lady who was showering was also putting on make-up and drying her hair.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The three people in line ahead of me were
    complaining about the fact that they needed to pee badly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I joined in the conversation and after five minutes, I knocked on the door
    to tell the occupant to hurry up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;We
    all need to pee&quot; I said, make it quick please!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I ran into my room to get a towel for the shower and when I returned, there
    were only two people waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Great&quot;
    I thought, the line is moving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The person
    using the bathroom flushed the bowl and turned on the shower.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sound of water running made me have to pee
    even worse.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Chris called me from downstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The guest
    speakers had arrived and I had to have them sign a contract.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't want to lose my place on line, but I had
    no<o:p></o:p> other choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I went down stairs to speak
    to the speakers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris must have known that I
    hadn't been to the bathroom, because he said &quot;next time you'll get up early with
    me&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sat down, crossed my legs
    tightly, and talked to the speakers about the seminar they were getting ready to present.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They signed their contract and I gave them a
    check.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They then went over to the kitchen for
    coffee and bagels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris was sitting next to
    me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to pee so bad I was afraid to get
    up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had my peehole pressed tight against
    the chair and if I moved, I thought I'd pee my pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Did you ever have to pee so bad that your whole body trembled? Well, that is
    the state I was in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris grabbed me by the
    hand and said &quot;come on, let's get you upstairs&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I held on for all I was worth, but couldn't walk fast. Chris must have
    known, because he walked slowly with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    we reached the bathroom, there were 4 desperate people in line.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The same two that I had left there, plus two more.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I looked at Chris and whispered, &quot;I don't
    think I can hold it in any longer&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    took me by the arm and walked back into our room.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Chris thought I'd be more comfortable waiting in our room, than out on line with a bunch
    of people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone had used the bathroom,
    except the four people who were still waiting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'd
    be fifth, no matter if I were out there or in my room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I was holding it in with my hand by now, and Chris knew I didn't want people
    to see me like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tried talking to me
    to get my mind off my bladder, but I was bursting at the seams.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing I could do could take my mind off the fact
    that I was about to pee my pants. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Remember, I
    never like to let Chris know I even have to go, let alone let him see me this desperate.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had no choice right now.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was bouncing up and down on the bed holding
    myself between the legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris told me that I
    should take my pants off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said just in
    case any came out, at least I wouldn't wet my pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>That was a good idea because I only had one pair of jeans with me.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't take my hand from my pussy, so Chris
    unzipped my pants and pulled at them from the ankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I uncrossed my legs for a second so that he could get them off.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A small squirt escaped, but I quickly clamped it
    off. My underwear came off along with my jeans, and I was now sitting on the bed naked
    from the waist down and desperate too pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris
    looked out the door and told me the same 4 people were still in line.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone was not only using the bathroom, but also
    showering and probably blow-drying their hair as well.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Chris started to kiss me and told me not to worry, and that I'd be okay.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He told me that he was going to get my mind off my
    bladder for a while, and began to fondle my breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I was breathing heavy now, partly because I had to pee so badly, but partly
    because I was getting turned on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris took
    my hand from between my legs and placed his own hand hard against my peehole.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he did this, he also pinched my lips together
    and asked me if that made it any better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    did, actually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It took some of the pressure
    off my bladder muscle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before long, Chris
    replaced his hand with his hard penis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
    pressing right up against my peehole and I thought I was going to scream with pleasure,
    and with pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't even realize that he
    had entered me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Somehow I orgasmed, but still
    managed to hold on to my pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When we were
    done, he quickly placed his hand back against my peehole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>He told me that the fact I was holding on so tight turned him on.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He said it was like screwing a virgin and that it
    was very hard for him to enter me.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    By now, I was scrunched up in a ball on the bed, my bladder ready to burst open.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris looked out the door and told me there was
    only one person left in the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She finally
    entered the bathroom and Chris and I walked out into the hallway.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By now, Chris had to go again too.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was quick, thank goodness.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We walked into the bathroom together and I sat
    down to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It felt so good.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I must have peed for two minutes straight.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After my relief, I went into the shower and heard
    Chris peeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few seconds later he was in
    the shower with me, ready for round two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    tightened my bladder muscles again, as best I could, and we made love.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    That was a week ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of us has spoken
    about the experience, but I am sure he enjoyed it as much as I did.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Who knows?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    for one, hope this was the<o:p></o:p> start of something good!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll
    keep you posted.<o:p></o:p></span></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><br>
