    If ever my boss asked me if I wanted to do a little overtime it usually meant working late
    in the workshop of the garage getting a car ready for delivery the next day. A rush job.
    This was fine but on one such occasion the job turned out to be much more enjoyable.<br>
    <br>
    'How would you like to run up to Heathrow this evening?' he asked.<br>
    <br>
    From Bristol this wasn't any big deal and I had nothing else planned so I said 'Yeah,
    sure'.<br>
    <br>
    He carried on, 'It's just that Fiona's flying in from Paris and I just have to be at a
    meeting until late, so she would have to get a train or coach or something and you know
    what she's like in those situations, she's likely to have a disaster of some sort.'<br>
    <br>
    I knew what she was like alright, an accident looking for somewhere to happen, a real
    scatterbrain. Apart from that, I also knew from having net her a few times over the years
    that she was now a very attractive 17 year old girl, tall, slim and leggy, with straight
    black hair halfway down her back. She had apparently been on a sort of exchange visit to
    brush up on her French for a week and was bringing a lot of presents for her friends and
    family - too much to lug around on the train anyway. After work, I drove the boss' current
    runabout - a nearly new Citroen XM - home so I could change, and then set off for the M4,
    looking forward immensely to having the company of the lovely Fiona for the latter part of
    the evening.<br>
    <br>
    After an uneventful journey I parked up and found that the flight was delayed and I had
    over an hour to wait- this I didn't mind at all, in fact I had planned to arrive early as
    I knew from past experience that airports are a likely place in which to spy females in
    need of a loo, a splendid way to spend the evening. After a couple of cups of coffee, I
    positioned myself near a ladies loo and settled down to wait. Sure enough, an American
    couple in their 40s came by and the woman was nearly cross-legged with needing a pee. Not
    having seen the loos yet, I heard her say to hubby 'Jesus Henry, I'm going to burst in a
    minute, where the hell's the john in this place?' Henry saw the sign and pointed her in
    the right direction and she hobbled past me on her way to relief.<br>
    <br>
    I was about to go for a pee myself, not wanting to stop on the way home, as it would be
    late enough already, when at last Fiona's plane arrived. She looked as beautiful as ever
    and wore a white, thick woollen jumper, a black pleated skirt, well above knee, and black
    boots. As the plane had been late I told her that maybe we had better get a move on
    because I had told her father that we would be back before 11pm and it was now 9pm. After
    getting all the luggage and loading the car, we finally got on the road 20 minutes later
    and I drove back to the M4, feeling quite exited now. There was a good reason for this.<br>
    <br>
    When we had loaded the boot, I had taken the trolley back to where I had found it and when
    I glanced back towards the car I saw that Fiona, unaware of me watching, was stepping from
    foot to foot in an unmistakable 'I need to pee!' manner. I didn't need to be an expert to
    see that! I really couldn't believe my good luck and wondered how long she would be before
    having to ask me to stop somewhere.<br>
    <br>
    We set off and were soon on the M4 and I stuck to the 70mph limit for a change to make the
    journey last. Fiona began to chatter away about her trip to France - normally she is very
    quiet and shy - and I could see her getting more and more anxious as her need increased.
    As we approached the first services she asked if I was going to stop - which I would
    normally have done, now needing to pee quite a bit - but I just said 'No, I don't think I
    need to, how about you?'<br>
    <br>
    She definately hesitated but said ' No, I'm OK thanks' so I carried on. After 30 minutes
    she was shifting in the seat and crossing her legs first one way then another, and I saw,
    whenever we passed a light, that this had caused her short skirt to ride up almost to
    crotch level. I was very aroused and having to make an effort to concentrate on my
    driving.<br>
    <br>
    I knew she was getting desperate when she asked how long it would be until we got home,
    and I answered truthfully that it would be over an hour. She bit her lip and squirmed in
    the seat again, trying to get more comfortable. Imagine my delight when up ahead we saw
    the taillights of a queue of cars and lorries and ahead of that there were flashing
    lights. <br>
    <br>
    The traffic came to a halt and Fiona said ' What's going on, will we be here long?' She
    sounded very worried and sat up, straight-backed, in her seat. I could just make out the
    movement of her legs as she knocked her knees together and I was now able to give her my
    full attention. There was nothing to do but wait so we talked for a while, but she was
    obviously thinking of other things. We had been there 15 minutes with no sign of the
    traffic moving when, having been silent for a minute, she said, 'Nick? Um, I need to go to
    the loo - I don't think I can wait much longer. What can I do?'<br>
    <br>
    'Oh, is it really urgent?' I asked. 'We should be moving in a minute'. She must have been
    really bursting because now, having let me know her problem, she was pressing a hand to
    her crotch and rocking back and forth.<br>
    <br>
    'I should have gone at the airport,' she said, 'I didn't go on the plane and I thought I'd
    have time before we left but what with being so late I thought I'd try and wait. But I
    can't!' she said, sounding close to tears. There were cars all around us and so it was
    impossible for her to pee outside without being seen even though everyone had switched
    their headlamps off and I began to feel sorry for her. She waited a little longer and then
    said 'It's no good, I can't wait! I'm going to wet myself!' I wondered what she was doing
    when suddenly she reached down and took of her boots and then, saying 'Don't look!', she
    lifted her skirt up around her waist. Before I could look away she pulled her white
    panties down and took them off too, and, in a state of panic, scrambled out of the car. I
    then realised what she was doing, as she just stood, barefoot, by the open door of the car
    and I could see by the light of the car interior light that she was peeing as she stood
    there. It gushed down her legs and went on for what seemed like minutes. I also noticed
    that there were a couple of droplets of pee on the black leather seat and, knowing that
    she couldn't see, I picked up her knickers from where they had fallen on the floor. They
    were wet at the crotch and on the bottom, so I reckoned that she had been unable to hold
    it for some time before this last desperate dash to leave the car.<br>
    <br>
    She got back in and with a big sigh said 'Oh God, that's better, I don't think I've ever
    been so desperate! Please, you won't say anything will you? Daddy would kill me if he
    found out! I just thought it was better than making a mess of his car, I'm sorry. That was
    so embarrassing!'<br>
    <br>
    'That's OK' I said, which was something of an understatement, because I had enjoyed every
    minute of it.<br>
    <br>
    Only then did I realize that I also had an uncomfortably full bladder, having drunk three
    large coffees since leaving home. Over the next hour until we moved I began to feel what
    she must have gone through, not wanting to say anything to her about my predicament
    either. When we got moving finally I was bursting for a piss but there were no other
    stopping places until I had dropped her off nearly an hour after that so I know from that
    night just what it means to be 'Too shy to ask'</font><p class="storyteller"><font
