    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I found this story on one of my
    first 'net surfing' sessions, in 1996, but the version I downloaded was incomplete,
    possibly due to my inexperience on the net, ending with the girls still on the train.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have 'tidied' the start and written an ending I
    consider most probable, and would have liked to have witnessed, and offer the completed
    story for others to enjoy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the original
    author reads it, or anyone has the complete original version, I would like to have a copy,
    to see what really happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The events remind me of the times
    when I used to drink in the West End of London at weekends, and it was possible to see at
    least one good desperation scene, though not up to this standard, almost every week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was in her mid-twenties, heavy
    rather than fat, but her ample buttocks filled her tight-fitting light blue jeans nicely.
    What fascinated me most was the fact that she was engaged in heavy drinking with her
    female friends, who couldn't keep up with her speed. When she went to the bar to get
    another pint, she usually returned with one for herself only, because her friends were not
    yet ready for another round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The second time
    she did this, I made sure I was also at the bar, and, emboldened by alcohol, offered her a
    drink and then suggested she join my group for a bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I wasn't too unhappy that it was my
    turn to get another round, and I made sure that her pint was filled to the brim. Her name
    was Amy, they were tourists, and their hotel was near Earl's Court station.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stayed with us for another half an hour or so,
    drinking two pints with us, before she went back to her friends to decide what to do after
    the pub closed in about 20 minutes time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I can't remember if I ever saw her
    visit the ladies that evening, but she positively hadn't been for over an hour at that
    point. What was amazing about her was the fact that she didn't seem drunk at all. In this
    last hour (including the 30 minutes she spent with us), I saw her drinking at least three
    pints of lager. She had been at this place for a couple of hours, so she must have had
    quite a few before that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When last orders were called, I saw
    her return with her two hands full of lagers and half-pint glasses full of indefinable red
    stuff. She still hadn't been to the loo, as she would have had to walk past me on her way
    there. In fact, I had her in full view as she stood at the bar; to my amazement she wasn't
    fidgeting at all. Her companions took up the glasses that she handed out and started
    drinking. In good English fashion she had ordered more than one pint for herself at the
    bell and was finished with her first when the landlord (it was about 15 past) became
    slightly unpleasant, turning the lights on and the music off, which I didn't mind at all
    since it gave me the opportunity to eavesdrop on their conversation. Apparently her mates
    were waiting for her to finish, because they wanted to move on to some club. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At that, she said something like
    &quot;Wait a minute, you have more than half of your drinks left.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But they didn't want any more and
    pushed the drinks over to her side as a joke. &quot;Well, you finish them.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OK, I'll show you... Bottoms
    up!&quot; She took up her pint, which was filled 3/4 to the top and started gulping the
    beer down to the rhythmical and encouraging shouts of her mates. It was too good to be
    true. After that she drank up what was left of that indefinable red stuff in one swig (1/2
    a pint) and another half pint from her friend. She bowed mockingly to their applause and
    they all left. This was getting very interesting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I followed the girls up Charing
    Cross road a little, before they turned left back into Soho again. They walked on for a
    couple of blocks, before they reached their club. A crowd was waiting outside, and our
    girls joined the queue. Another twenty minutes passed, until Amy walked up to the doorman
    and started arguing with him. She could take a hell of a lot of alcohol, but it was now
    visible that she was slightly tipsy (probably due to the fresh air), and so the man just
    shrugged his shoulders and probably told her to be patient. I could also note that she was
    beginning to get a little uneasy. Finally all that liquid was having some effect. At first
    it had been very unobtrusive; as she stood on the street, joking with her friends she
    shifted to and fro, at times casually bending forward and generally keeping in motion.
    Then she would stand still with her legs crossed for another minute, before taking a short
    step to her side. She was still doing very well, considered that she had had four pints,
    another one swallowed in one go and half a pint of that other stuff. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As they were waiting I watched the
    scene with increasing attention. I knew from the way they were dressed; they'd never make
    it into this club. Amy wasn't yet desperate, but it was obvious that she wanted to go. I
    was almost standing next to her, making sure that they didn't notice me. Amy had her hands
    in her pockets now, with her legs close together, doing a kind of on-the-spot walk.
    Although she had been the one who had insisted, after negotiating with the doorman, that
    they wait and try to get in, she was now beginning to change her mind. It started dawning
    on the others too that they might never get admitted. She was moving back and forth and
    kept swinging her hips sideways. As the minutes went by I could see her walking in a small
    circle from time to time, as if walking around an imaginary object lying there. It was
    around midnight, when I saw them arguing and their gestures suggested that they were
    debating something. One of the girls pointed to her wristwatch. I tried to get closer
    again to listen to what they were saying, when all of a sudden I saw Amy cross and uncross
    her legs quickly, bobbing up and down twice and pointing to the left of her. I figured
    that she was saying something like &quot;I have to go...&quot; emphasizing the fact with
    her motions but her friend made a gesture with her hand, indicating &quot;hurry up&quot;
    and pointing to the right. After that, they all dashed off. I realized that they were
    trying to catch the last tube, and the tube station, was closing, well, like now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I knew where they were headed it
    was easy for me to follow them. Surprisingly, Amy was the fastest of them. We made it just
    in time, as the station managers were beginning to close the iron gates of Leicester
    Square tube station. The running must have made the situation worse for Amy, as she was
    clearly desperate now. On the way down on the escalators (and in a London tube an
    escalator ride can take a minute or two...) she rushed ahead of the group, turned round in
    feigned surprise to see that the rest were standing on the stairs way above her and
    proceeded to walk back up, against the direction of the escalators. Then she stood there,
    her thighs closely together, but her feet resting on different stairs, bending forward
    until her nose almost touched the shoes of the one riding above her. After the escalator
    ride, they had to find which line to take and which platform. Amy couldn't stand still and
    walked up and down in front of the map as the others consulted it. Unfortunately, Amy, as
    the leader of the group was the only one with a sound sense of direction and seemed to
    know her way around, so the others asked her for help. (I had the impression that another
    one of them was getting desperate as well). She pressed her legs together and made a
    pained face. I was able to hear everything, as I was now standing around a corner, less
    than two yards away from them. She kept saying things like &quot;I need to go&quot; and
    &quot;I really need a loo.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When one of them asked her to tell
    them where to go, she hobbled up to the sign. I had expected her to double up, but instead
    she reached for her jeans, tugging as she straightened up. She was trying to pull her
    jeans into her crotch in a desperate attempt to hold it back. After wriggling around like
    that for a minute she said, &quot;The green one, down there,&quot; nodding in that
    direction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now, the tube stations in central
    London do not have any toilets, and no really secluded spots where a girl could squat;
    especially not on a fairly busy night like this. Amy seemed to know this, as she didn't
    attempt to look for a loo, but I could see her looking at everything that promised to
    offer an opportunity for her to pee. However, there was nowhere, and the girls told Amy to
    be patient, the train will be here any minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another one, a somewhat plain and freckled redhead, shorter and much
    slimmer than Amy, wearing darker jeans that were quite a loose fit, admitted the she was
    bursting too. Her words were &quot;I just want to let it go...all that cheap red wine goes
    straight through me.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Amy was almost beyond desperation.
    She had walked down to the platform with the top button of her jeans opened, tugging
    desperately at them. From time to time she had slowed down and slowly moved forward, her
    legs half crossed. She walked up and down the platform for about five minutes when they
    arrived. From the beginning, she hadn't cared whether others were aware of her situation
    or not. Now she wasn't ashamed of openly holding herself. Also I noticed that her
    expression was changing from that kind of &quot;God-I-have-to-go&quot; show some girls put
    on, almost making fun of their own situation, to real desperation, reflecting the pain her
    bladder was giving her. I heard her saying &quot;If nothing happens in the next five
    minutes, I'll just have to go here&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't, Amy, please.&quot; The
    others were now trying to keep her from publicly pissing in that half secluded (but still
    plainly visible) area on the end of the platform just before the tunnel starts.
    &quot;Please.&quot; She was holding herself, stooping and bending forward until her bum
    almost reached the ground. The red-haired one, who was desperate too, was talking to her.
    The others thought that she was (as her situation was similar) the best person to persuade
    her NOT to relieve herself publicly. Then another one had an idea. The gates must have
    been closed by now so nobody, they figured, would be there if they went back towards the
    entrance again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We'll miss the train...&quot;
    said another one. Amy, who had been the most talkative of them, was becoming more and more
    silent. She would shiver from time to time, and I could really see the color of her face
    changing once in a while, as if she was blushing. For the first time I witnessed a
    &quot;holding technique&quot; I had never seen before. She pressed both her hands into her
    crotch, but not one over another. Her right hand reached between her legs from the front,
    while the left came from behind, holding the other hand and pressing both palms against
    her crotch, while pulling her arms upwards, and rubbing from time to time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another couple of minutes passed
    until Amy reached that final stage of desperation: She was now sitting on her heels. At
    first she was just kind of sitting on her right ankle, bouncing rapidly, grabbing her
    crotch every now and then. Then she changed into a crouching position, resting her weight
    on her right toes and ball, thus pressing her heel firmly into her crotch. From where I
    was standing I unfortunately couldn't see her back or crotch closely, but she hadn't
    pissed herself yet apparently. However, the redhead was nearly as desperate and trying to
    hide her embarrassment by behaving a little too childishly, occasionally giggling and
    crossing her legs or even holding herself for a few seconds. As no one paid any attention
    to her &quot;antics,&quot; she walked over to Amy and begged her to come with her,
    &quot;just to find somewhere, you know, anywhere we can go.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Amy actually had to clear her throat
    before speaking and her voice was shaking. &quot;I can't. God I'll...(groan) ...piss
    myself if I... move.&quot; The redhead, who I had heard called Linda, looked at her and
    said nothing. Amy wasn't kidding or hopping around childishly. Then she muttered something
    like &quot;...just a sec&quot; and stood up, both hands between her legs in that peculiar
    double handed holding style of hers. They seemed to consider going right to the end of the
    platform and peeing there, but there were too many people and the lights were too bright
    to make this a viable situation. The started back towards the escalators, but Amy hadn't
    gone far when she had to stop and twist her legs together as well as holding her crotch.
    &quot;It's not good,&quot; she wailed, &quot;Walking makes it worse, I can't hold it much
    longer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This delay was the last straw for
    Linda, who first crossed her legs tightly, then pressed her hand between them, as if she
    could feel a leak coming on. I wondered if either girl was going to be able to walk far
    enough to find anywhere to pee, but before they could get any further, the train finally
    arrived. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What can we do, we must get
    the train, and it's the last one.&quot; Amy still seemed to be aware of their
    circumstances, while Linda was concerned only with easing her bladder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;How long is the journey? Oh
    God, I don't think I can wait any longer, I must go NOW!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Seeing their hesitation, the other
    two more or less dragged them on the train, ignoring their protests of not being able to
    move etc. The train was crowded, and they had to stand in a group just inside the door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had followed them on the train, and was standing
    close to their circle, looking over the shoulder of the girl on Amy's left and facing
    Linda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hoped I was blending into the
    background, and that they would not recognize me as having been around earlier, but my
    desire to see exactly what Amy and Linda were doing made me risk getting as close as I
    could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They were all facing inwards and
    this enabled both Amy and Linda to hold their crotches, their legs plaited as tightly as
    it was humanly possible. In fact the tube was so crowded that unless you were standing
    close to them, you could not see that they were holding themselves. Amy and Linda were
    both almost in tears with desperation, and Amy was groaning that now she was standing up
    she couldn't wait any longer, emphasizing this by pulling both her hands up into her
    crotch even harder, turning them over so that the side of her hands were pressing against
    her pussy, and then moving them about in a small circular motion. This was another new
    holding technique, which must have been more effective in containing the incipient leak,
    presumably applying maximum pressure where it was most needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The other two girls now realized
    just how desperate the situation was becoming, and the taller looked at the map on the
    train wall and told Amy that it was only 4 stops to Earls Court, and there was sure to be
    a loo there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy was virtually speechless
    with desperation, and was moaning between clenched teeth, muttering things like &quot;Oh
    this train, every jolt hurts so much...<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    want to piss so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh please, I must go...
    I can't wait any longer, I'm going to die.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Linda's condition seemed to have
    improved now she could hold her crotch all the time, and she was still capable of coherent
    thought and speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Four stations,
    that's going to be more than 10 minutes.&quot; she gasped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;I am not sure that I can last that long, I'm absolutely desperate, I'm
    going to do it down my leg soon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Two more stops passed, then the
    third station, where there was some delay, and the doors shut and then opened again
    several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy now had her eyes shut and
    was shaking with the effort she was making to hold back her pee.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was still using the 'front and back' holding
    technique, her right hand turned so the side of her hand was pressing against her pussy,
    and it looked as if she was pressing with every ounce of her strength.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had now completely undone the zip of her
    jeans, presumably to try to reduce the pressure on her bursting bladder, but as she
    appeared to be wearing a large pair of 'control' panties, these must still have been
    exerting agonizing pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because she was
    constantly holding her crotch, it was difficult to see clearly, but her bladder did not
    seem very swollen, particularly considering how much beer she was holding.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The control panties were doing a good job
    flattening her stomach, but must have been causing terrible pressure in her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the train finally moved off, she
    just managed to gasp &quot;How much longer? Oh God, I'm going to explode if I don't pee
    soon.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Linda was still surviving with just
    one hand holding her crotch, her legs twisted tightly together and bending forward
    slightly, and more aware of what was going on round her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Their imminent arrival at Earls Court station brought on another problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can anyone remember where the
    loos are at Earls Court station?&quot; she appealed to the other girls. &quot;There must
    be some at a station that size, but I can't remember ever seeing a ladies' room.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh please hurry, I can't hold it much
    longer.&quot; Anticipation was making her need more urgent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We've always used the back
    entrance, the loos are bound to be at the other end, the main entrance. We had better get
    some change ready, it's not going to be a free one.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ten pence, a pound, I don't
    care how much, I'll pay anything so long as I can pee in the next minute,&quot; groaned
    Amy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I can't let go, can someone please
    pay for me and I'll give them the money after.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It's only five minutes to our
    hotel, we might as well go straight there and save the money,&quot; said one of the other
    girls, either unaware of Amy's state of absolute desperation or wanting to prolong her
    agony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can't, I'm not sure I can
    even manage to walk off the train.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm in
    absolute agony, literally every second it takes to get to the loo is vital.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Amy was now holding her crotch with both hands
    from the front, and doubled over to emphasize just how desperate she was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had been standing close enough
    that I could see and hear all that was going on, and I sensed that the evening was
    reaching its climax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew that there were
    no toilets anywhere on Earls Court station, and that the girls going to what they called
    the 'main entrance' was the worst thing they could do, as it would prolong their journey
    to their hotel and take them away from the 'take away' food shops that might just have
    allowed two desperate girls to use their toilet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
    the two entrances to Earls Court were on different roads, with no easy way between the
    two.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If they had not used the 'main
    entrance' before, the girls were not going to find it easy to find their hotel.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was in for a 5-mile walk home if I got
    off at Earls Court, but I was not going to miss the end of this for anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As they got off the train, I saw
    that while both girls were frantic to pee, they were suffering in different ways.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Linda was almost running up the platform,
    un-ashamedly holding her crotch, presumably unable to contain herself unless she did.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She turned back to the other three, following more
    slowly, and mouthed &quot;Quick!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hurry up!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't wait,&quot; then sat down while they
    caught up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason they were going so
    slowly was that Amy could hardly walk she was so desperate, the pain of her distended
    bladder making her take short steps almost on tiptoe, and the other two girls had to help
    her along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing that there was no chance of
    getting Amy to hurry, Linda had rejoined the group, but continued to plead with them,
    particularly Amy, to hurry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I can't wait much longer, it's
    so bad I can't hold it any more...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going
    to wet myself, I can't help it... please, please hurry... Quick! Where's the loo?<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm going to do it any second...&quot; she was in
    a truly terrible state, and I was expecting to see a wet patch appear between her legs any
    moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not many people had got off the
    train, so I had no problem seeing all this, walking slowly just behind Amy and her
    helpers, staggering slightly to give the impression that I was drunk and not interested in
    the girls' antics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Probably the only one who
    might have recognized me was Amy, and at that moment I don't think she was aware of
    anything except the pressure in her bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    steps up from the platform were almost too much for Amy, but the other two girls virtually
    dragged her up them, encouraged by Linda, who was holding herself with both hands and
    still pleading them to hurry before she wet herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Now they were at the main entrance concourse, and the moment of truth, when
    they found there were no toilets at the station.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Linda
    was already looking frantically around, appealing to the others to help her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Where are they? I can't see a loo anywhere.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be one, oh where is it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Not getting any directions from her
    friends, Linda was trying to run, while still holding her crotch, round the concourse,
    presumable thinking that the ladies' was hidden in some way.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the others took the more obvious approach
    and asked the only visible porter, who, with the true off-hand attitude of a London
    Transport employee, told her the were no passenger toilets on the station, and that it was
    impossible for passengers to use the staff toilets, no matter how urgent their need, then
    adding that an all-night petrol station on the Brompton Road had the nearest toilets.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew roughly where this was, but given the
    girls' lack of local knowledge and the state of Amy and Linda, it might as well have been
    on the moon for all the good it would do them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Outside the station, Linda was
    holding herself with both hands, her legs plaited together, somehow still managing to hold
    back her pee, though not for much longer it seemed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Quick!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I must find a loo, what am I going to do?&quot;
    she appealed to the others, &quot;Oh please help me find somewhere.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know what I'm like, when I want to go this
    badly, I just can't hold it back.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's no
    good, I can't wait any longer, I'll have to go in the gutter, and anywhere is better than
    wetting myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The station entrance was on a busy,
    well-lit road, and even Linda was not prepared to squat and pee there.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had been hanging about, as if waiting to cross
    the road, until I saw what the girls were going to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Linda had seen a side road about 50 yards away, and was hurrying towards
    that, though she was slowed by having to hold her crotch, and several times stopped and
    twisted her legs together, as, presumably, the urge to pee became even more intense.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had abandoned all caution about being noticed,
    and was following her at a fast walk, trying to keep up, but she was way ahead when she
    turned into the side road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I turned the
    corner Linda was between two parked cars, struggling to undo her jeans while still holding
    herself with one hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I kept walking along
    the pavement towards her, and it seemed that she was too desperate to care who saw her,
    because as I drew level, she pulled down her jeans and panties in one move and crouched
    down, letting go a blast of pee while she was still half standing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to keep walking, though much slower, as she
    was now crouched right down and could not see me, and I could hear the force of her pee
    hitting the road, an absolute torrent, though it did not last long.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unable to resist seeing (and hearing) the end of
    this, I ducked into a dark basement entrance, hoping that there was nobody at home who
    would see me, pretending to be looking for my keys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was only just hidden in the
    shadows when Amy staggered round the corner, holding herself with one hand in the
    'conventional' way now she had to walk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Linda
    had just finished her pee, a mighty torrent that had not lasted long, and stood up,
    pulling up her jeans, and called Amy over, telling her that no one would see her peeing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Just don't tread in my puddle,&quot; she
    ended with a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Amy needed no encouragement, and was
    pulling down her jeans as soon as she was between the cars, gasping: &quot;Oh thank God!
    Oh, at last I can pee,&quot; as she crouched down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    could not see her any more, but it seemed she was able to hold in her pee until she was
    crouching right down, then I heard the splatter of her pee on the road, nothing like the
    force of Linda's torrent, but she just went on and on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>All three girls were standing on the pavement, 'keeping guard,' and when one
    said &quot;Hurry up, before someone comes,&quot; she replied &quot;I can't stop, I was
    absolutely bursting, it's going to take me at least five minutes to empty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It might not have taken quite that
    long, but she did seem to be peeing for ages, possibly the longest pee I have ever
    witnessed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As she did up the zip of her
    jeans, she held her stomach, groaning something like &quot;It still hurts so much I think
    I must have strained myself holding on so long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    don't think I have ever been so desperate in my life.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>It's a miracle I didn't explode- I wanted to go so badly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Thankfully, instead of carrying on
    down the road, when they would have seen me hiding in the shadows, the girls decided to go
    back to the main road and get a taxi to their hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>As they walked away, I saw Linda feeling between her legs from behind, as if
    she was checking whether her jeans were wet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    was too dark to see if there was any wet patch, but this did indicate to me that she must
    have come very close to wetting herself, maybe even leaking in her panties.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had a 90-minute walk home, but it was well worth
    it, as I have never witnessed such a prolonged or intense desperation situation with any
    girl before, let alone two of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would
    loved to have been able to measure the volume of Amy's pee, or even see the size of the
    puddles they produced, but it seemed more prudent to slip away before I was spotted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
