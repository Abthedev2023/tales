      <P align="left" class="storyteller">The Army Girls</P>
      <P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
      <P>On joining the army the first thing you learn is to obey the orders of 
        your senior officers. Little did Beth know how difficult that was about 
        to become the day they trudged into barracks that cold, damp November 
        morning. Their first sight of sergeant Willis was that very morning as 
        they gathered on the parade ground. He was a fiercesome character, tall, 
        muscular; an imposing figure if ever there was one. Willis loved his job. 
        He loved making soldiers out of raw recruits. He loved being a hard man 
        and in the army the only way was the hard way. It didn&#146;t matter to 
        him one bit that it was women he was in charge of; to him one soldier 
        was just like any other at the end of the day no matter what sex they 
        were.</P>
      <P>Beth ended up in a billet with five other girls. The first few weeks 
        training passed relatively smoothly. At the end of their second week they 
        had to do a 3-mile run in less than 16 minutes. Each failed which started 
        to get them noticed by the sergeant. The following day he was having them 
        run the course again with him pounding close behind them all the way, 
        forcing them into greater efforts. Needless to say each passed, but from 
        that day on the sergeant had his eye on them.</P>
      <P>Then came the day of a surprise night exercise. It had been an afternoon 
        off up to then. The girls had enjoyed a few beers and a laugh with some 
        of the male soldiers on the camp, returning to their barracks late in 
        the afternoon. As they tumbled into their room they were greeted by the 
        sergeant. He immediately announced they were off on a night exercise and 
        to pack their kit bags for immediate departure. While Beth started packing 
        her friend, Jane tried to walk past the sergeant to the loos. He stopped 
        her in her tracks,</P>
      <P>&quot;And where do you think you are off to Torpee?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;The loo sir!&quot; Jane replied.</P>
      <P>&quot;Have I said you can go?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;No sir.&quot; Jane said.</P>
      <P>&quot;Well get packing as ordered! This is not a holiday camp, if I say 
        move you move, if I say pack you pack. There is no time in the army to 
        spend beautifying yourselves. This is an active exercise, you do nothing 
        from this moment on unless commanded by me.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;It wasn&#146;t beauty I was going for, sergeant,&quot; Jane pleaded, 
        &quot;I really need to pee.&quot;</P>
      <P>Some of the other girls sniggered at Jane&#146;s brazen admission.</P>
      <P>&quot;Need to pee?&quot; The sergeant said, ignoring the others.</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes sergeant.&quot; She said trying not to scrunch her legs together 
        too much.</P>
      <P>&quot;There will be no peeing until I give the order, is that understood?&quot;</P>
      <P>Jane thought he was joking but one look up at his face, black as thunder, 
        told her otherwise, &quot;Yes sergeant.&quot; She replied, returning to 
        her bunk and reluctantly starting to pack her kit bag.</P>
      <P>The sergeant turned to leave and after the giggles had died down Jane 
        was told that it probably wouldn&#146;t be long before he came back and 
        gave her permission. At this point Beth realised just how much she needed 
        to go as well. She&#146;d had about two and a half pints of lager, about 
        1250ml, and knew from past experience that she would be bursting before 
        too long, once all that liquid hit home. She kept one eye on the door 
        to their billet, praying for the sergeant to return. </P>
      <P>Half an hour later he had not returned and the first they heard of him 
        was when he bellowed down the corridor for them to get fell in on the 
        courtyard outside. Jane was obviously still in some discomfort and Beth 
        guessed most of the other girls from her billet must need to go as well, 
        even if they weren&#146;t showing any outward signs. As for herself she 
        was aching to go and could feel a growing pressure pushing down towards 
        her pee hole.</P>
      <P>Out in the courtyard they were ordered to lay their kit out for inspection. 
        Jane could barely stand still as the sergeant came towards her. She sprang 
        to attention; grateful to have her legs pressed together for a little 
        while. All too soon the sergeant told her to stand at ease while he inspected 
        her kit. As Beth watched she saw Jane almost twisting her thighs together 
        and reaching a hand down towards her groin. Her hands were locked into 
        two tightly clenched fists as she battled to avoid wetting herself. She 
        was clearly bursting and probably only seconds from peeing her panties. 
        In desperation she asked the sergeant if she could pee before they left. 
        He eyed her up and down as she took little hops in front of him, willing 
        herself to hang on so she did not disgrace herself in front of him.</P>
      <P>For an age he seemed to just stand there looking at her before finally 
        nodding, &quot;Dismissed Torpee, but be quick about it!&quot; He yelled.</P>
      <P>Jane swiveled, saluted, and literally sprinted across the parade ground, 
        one hand clutched underneath her bum. Jane and the others watched her 
        disappear. They were so dumb struck with her desperation they forgot about 
        themselves, however none of them dared ask to go as well for fear of getting 
        the sergeant cross again. Jane was bursting to go but was still in control. 
        She thought that all the beer she had drunk must have reached her bladder 
        by now and if she was as full as she was going to get she&#146;d probably 
        be okay until she could sneak off into the bushes when they had a rest 
        break or made camp.</P>
      <P>As soon as Jane returned the sergeant led his troop out into the countryside. 
        The plan was a twenty mile route march before making camp. They would 
        then be met by a truck and driven back to base. The sergeant marched on 
        at the front and the twenty girls marched in three ranks behind him. Beth 
        was dying for a piss. She could feel a strong ache in her abdomen and 
        only the fact they were constantly walking was stopping her from reaching 
        down between her legs. She was praying for a rest stop soon. Another hour 
        later and they were finally given permission to fall out for a rest and 
        a smoke for those that wanted. Much to Beth&#146;s joy, One girl went 
        over and asked the sergeant about going for a wee. She returned shaking 
        her head however, &quot;He says if we were in the jungle we couldn&#146;t 
        just squat. We need to make camp first and set up proper facilities.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Proper facilities, &quot;cried Beth, &quot;I&#146;m close to facilitating 
        that bush over there no matter what he says!&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Me too!&quot; chimed in another girl and as Beth watched she did 
        just that. Out of sight of the sergeant she quickly crouched, lowered 
        her army trousers and peed quickly onto the ground. Several other girls 
        did the same.</P>
      <P>Despite her growing torment Beth couldn&#146;t bring herself to go in 
        front of everyone. She took a cigarette instead and crouched, rocking 
        back and forth to ease the pressure of her rapidly growing desperation. 
        Ten minutes later they were on there way again. It was another two hours 
        before they stopped and by now Beth was almost beside herself with desperation. 
        The sergeant ordered them to make camp. He came over while Beth&#146;s 
        group was starting to pitch their tent and Beth found herself asking about 
        a wee. She was now that desperate all inhibitions or fears about the sergeant 
        were lost.</P>
      <P>&quot;If one of you asks me again I&#146;ll have you hanging on until 
        morning!&quot; He bellowed.</P>
      <P>Beth suddenly dropped a hand to her crotch and squeezed herself through 
        her trousers. The sergeant eyed her, &quot;Need to go badly eh?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes sergeant!&quot; she squealed, bending forward in an effort 
        to stop wetting herself in front of him.</P>
      <P>&quot;Bursting are we?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes sergeant.&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Really bursting?&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Yes sergeant!&quot;</P>
      <P>&quot;Good, you&#146;ll enjoy it all the more when I do finally let you 
        go!&quot; And with that he left. </P>
      <P>Beth couldn&#146;t believe it. She was in agony and she wished now she&#146;d 
        gone when she had the chance. Somehow she held on though while they finished 
        the tent. Then they were all called into the middle and the sergeant had 
        them standing at ease with while he went through the rudiments of making 
        a campfire. This was almost too much for poor Beth. Her bum was quivering 
        madly as she struggled to hold in her pee and before long she could feel 
        it teetering on the very edge of her urethra. She grabbed hold of herself 
        and squeezed hard, just bringing herself back under control before any 
        found its way into her knickers. Her bladder felt huge and rock hard. 
        She was longing to disappear from the group behind a nearby tree and she 
        was barely concentrating on what the sergeant was doing. All she could 
        think about now was having a wee.</P>
      <P>The fire building continued, followed by the boiling of a pan of water 
        for some tea. Tea was the last thing poor Beth wanted. They were sat now 
        by the fire, Beth having one heal lodged firmly against her tortured pee-hole. 
        She was rocking in short, barely noticeable movements, but just about 
        refraining from holding herself. Then they were told to get their mugs 
        from their kit bags for tea. At last Beth sensed a chance to escape into 
        the bushes. She struggled to her feet and managed to reach her tent. While 
        the others went inside she quickly looked behind her and then quickly 
        trotted by the tent towards a waiting line of trees. She was clutching 
        herself now as the thought of being so close to the pee she so desperately 
        needed came closer.</P>
      <P>Through the first line of trees she quickly spotted a bush and was already 
        unbuckling her belt as she approached. Frantically she dragged her trousers 
        down to her knees, pacing up and down as she then fumbled with the tiny 
        waistband of her oh so tight knickers. She&#146;d never been so desperate 
        before in all her life. Her bladder was huge and she gasped as her knickers 
        inched away from her bum. All she had to do now was crouch. She could 
        hear the sergeant shouting for their return but she just HAD to pee first. 
        Crouching, her pee poised on the very brink of the release she so badly 
        needed, she suddenly became aware of the sergeant standing over her. She 
        stood, fumbling for her clothes to hide herself. The sergeant smiled as 
        she yanked her knickers back on, followed by her trousers. Oh how she 
        needed to pee!</P>
      <P>The sergeant said nothing, he didn&#146;t have to, and Beth silently 
        followed him back to camp. She found her mug and joined the rest back 
        by the fire. She wanted to just let go there and then but didn&#146;t 
        dare; besides the sergeant would ensure she was the laughing stock of 
        the group. Instead she pressed her thighs together with all her might 
        as she sipped some tea. As far as the others were concerned she had just 
        found relief in the bushes.</P>
      <P>For the next hour the sergeant's eyes barely left her, giving her no 
        chance of escape. By now the hot, strong tea was adding to her intense 
        discomfort but she&#146;d made up her mind to wait it out, no matter what. 
        That would be the only way to spoil the sergeant's fun. Besides she knew 
        the truck to take them back would be here very soon and it would surely 
        only take them about twenty minutes to reach camp once they set off.</P>
      <P>Sure enough, about ten minutes later they could hear the sound of the 
        distant truck engine as it twisted through the woodside track towards 
        them. Beth&#146;s heart pounded hard, but she had found a new inner strength, 
        and besides that, now she had made up her mind relief was not to be had 
        until they got back to base it was somehow helping her hold on to her 
        raging, bulging bladder. Their tents were dismantled and their kit bags 
        packed as it drew up. With twenty girls and the sergeant, plus their kit, 
        it was a tight squeeze for them all to get into the truck. Beth waited 
        until near last to get onboard, enjoying a final squeeze before the agony 
        of the journey ahead. </P>
      <P>Already crammed the sergeant then stopped her getting in the back, saying 
        she should sit up front with him and the driver. She knew his game but 
        was powerless to object. So she clambered up front, squeezed between the 
        driver, who was another male soldier, and the sergeant. Setting off she 
        had her hands lightly folded over her lap, enabling her to press a little 
        harder when the urge to pee got too great. Five miles into the journey 
        she really needed to squeeze herself badly. Her bladder felt ready to 
        explode and it was taking all her will power to stop herself from leaking. 
        She longed to cross her legs and despite the cramped space she quickly 
        succeeded while the sergeant was temporarily gazing out of the side window. 
        This brought temporary relief, but unfortunately coincided with the roughest 
        part of the journey as the truck lurched down an uneven part of the route.</P>
      <P>She was nearly squealing out loud each time they hit a divot and began 
        to seriously doubt her ability to hang on. Each passing second saw her 
        desperation grow worse still, but she guessed they were no more than a 
        few miles now from base, indeed as she strained her eyes ahead she could 
        just make it out down below them. Her eyes glued to her salvation she 
        willed her pee back. She found it impossible to think of anything else 
        but peeing and the nearer they got the worse it became.</P>
      <P>Although they were in sight of the base it was still longer than she 
        thought. Over five miles in fact, due to the twisting, turning trail of 
        the track. She willed the driver to press down on the accelerator. Then 
        the sergeant pulled out his last trump card. He ordered the driver to 
        stop for a smoke break. Beth couldn&#146;t believe it. She thought how 
        stupid she had been to think he would allow her to reach the loo she craved 
        so badly and cursed under her breath. While most got out for a stretch 
        and a smoke Beth stayed firmly in her seat. The sergeant lit up by the 
        doorway and with the driver also out of the vehicle she was able to give 
        herself a long hard squeeze for the five minutes the sergeant gave for 
        the break. </P>
      <P>Back inside she had to stop squeezing herself, which she now found almost 
        impossible. She needed to go so badly her pee hole was aching beyond belief 
        and she could feel a flood of pee pressing right against her entrance, 
        just bursting to get out. Wriggling her bum as much as she dared she managed 
        to stop from wetting herself, but she knew she was on the brink now and 
        there was nothing more she could do to stop it. The five remaining miles 
        became three, and then two. It was a faster journey now as they reached 
        flat ground, but just getting closer was making it even worse for her. 
        The pressure was simply becoming too great and suddenly she felt a hot 
        surge of pee squirt into her panties. With alarm she managed to clamp 
        it off immediately. She stared down and was amazed to see nothing showed. 
      </P>
      <P>The release had felt SO good, but she didn&#146;t dare do any more. Her 
        panties were wet but the thick material of her army uniform kept the wetness 
        from show. As she released her clamp a few more dribbles trickled luxuriously 
        from her frantic pee hole and she gasped with joy before pressing really 
        hard down on her crutch as the next wave of desperation hit. Having let 
        a little go she felt better, but not much. She prayed that even just that 
        tiny squirt had maybe given her the time needed to scramble back to barracks 
        without a further devastating accident.</P>
      <P>Concentrating with all her might she managed to hang on until the main 
        gates approached. She was screaming inside but determined not to let out 
        any more. The driver parked near the parade ground and as they got out 
        Beth could feel the dampness between her legs from her earlier release, 
        but it didn&#146;t show to anyone else. She was absolutely frantic to 
        pee and barely able to control herself any longer. </P>
      <P>Instead of feeling angry at his failure to make her pee the sergeant 
        was instead full of admiration at her will power, despite her disappearance 
        into the bushes earlier. He told her so and even gave her permission to 
        sprint off to the toilets while he collected her bag for her.</P>
      <P>&quot;That&#146;s okay sergeant, I feel fine. I can manage my own bag 
        thank you.&quot; Beth said, triumphant, but through gritted teeth. Although 
        her bladder was fit to burst she waited in line for her bag to emerge 
        out of the back of the truck and then turned and smiled at the sergeant 
        as she walked calmly across the parade ground towards her barracks. As 
        she smiled at him her exhausted bladder finally let go and a surge of 
        pee ran like a waterfall into her knickers and quickly spread down the 
        inside of her legs. Fortunately the sergeant couldn&#146;t see what was 
        happening as she was now too far away. She clamped off again with a valiant 
        effort and made it to barracks without any further leaks by taking shorter, 
        shuffling steps. </P>
      <P>Dumping her bag on her bed she sprinted to the ladies, but was peeing 
        again before she finally yanked down her trousers and sodden panties as 
        she slammed the cubicle door shut. At last she sank onto the loo she&#146;s 
        needed for SO long. She was crying but happy at the same time. That pee 
        was the best she could ever remember but what really put the smile on 
        her face was her triumphant victory over the sergeant. Never again would 
        he look down on her on that parade ground. From here on in army life was 
        going to be a breeze! </P>
