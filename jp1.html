      <P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
      <P align="left">Last weekend my wife and I attended a wedding here in Phoenix. 
        It is getting a little warm so the ceremony was held outside. The wedding 
        was to take place at 2 p.m. so we got there about 1p.m. There was a tent 
        set up for the guests to drop off gifts and to get a glass of punch, etc. 
        My wife was quite thirsty and started drinking punch and had 2 or 3 glasses 
        within the first 10 minutes. She continued to sip until the ushers began 
        to seat us. She mentioned she should have visited the restroom but did 
        not have time to do so. After about 15 minutes into the ceremony she started 
        to fidget and cross her legs tightly. I noticed her hand wander to the 
        area just below her waist and press firmly. She was wearing a calf length 
        dress with a flowing flower patterned skirt so she was able to hide here 
        hand pretty well. She made it to the end of the ceremony and we tried 
        to move towards the restrooms but were blocked by the crowd. She mentioned 
        that we better do something pretty quick <BR>
        or she was going to wet herself. I didn't rush very much as I enjoy a 
        little wet play when it isn't planned. As we walked across the grass towards 
        the clubhouse I noticed a palm sized wet spot where she had been pressing 
        her hand. As we got closer she noticed there was a line at the restrooms. 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        She said, &quot; I can't wait&quot; , we turned around and headed towards 
        the landscaping adjacent to the lawn area. She said she was going to pee 
        on the grass but had to get her panties down as they were new satin panties 
        and she didn't want to ruin them. I said I would shield her from the others 
        and we tried to find some taller shrubs without any luck. She said, Oh, 
        no&quot; and stopped dead in her tracks. She looked at her skirt and said 
        she was flooding her panties but nothing was coming down her legs yet. 
        It was apparent her panties were holing a lot of the pee. All of a sudden 
        the satin saturated and the pee poured out of her panties and onto the 
        front of her skirt. It showed a bit but she would be all right when she 
        sat down. All I could do is watch in amazement and visualize the wet sex 
        we would have later. As a post script when we walked back to the table 
        her red satin panties were visible through her petticoat and skirt. I'm 
        sure she caused a few hard-ons that afternoon. Her panties stained her 
        petticoat pink were the pee had saturated the slip and panties.<BR>
