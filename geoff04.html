    <br>
    We'd moved from the shared house where Mrs X had danced so desperately outside the shared
    lavatory, (see Making her Wait - 1940's style) and therefore I never had another
    opportunity of making her wait to use it. Although many things were still rationed, such
    as meat, bread, butter and sweets, things slowly started to improve in the fifties
    (although not much) and we even spent the occasional day out, which meant using the
    generally rather primitive public conveniences at some time during the course of the day.<br>
    <br>
    As a small boy, I quite often accompanied my mother into the ladies' lavatories, waiting
    in line with her as she queued for a cubicle to become vacant. She always made sure she
    had an old penny in her purse to insert into the coin slot in the door, without which it
    wouldn't unlock (and of course the origin of the expression &quot;going to spend a
    penny&quot;).<br>
    <br>
    I have often watched fascinated as my mother struggled to hold up overcoat, skirt and
    petticoats whilst endeavouring to lower her knickers and nearly wetting herself in the
    process. This however, was the least of the problems. In those days, women all wore a
    girdle or corset equipped with four or more suspenders to hold up their stockings. Girdles
    commonly came down to cover the tops of the thighs, thus giving a smooth dress line over
    the hips. This very tight garment had to be got out of the way before sitting upon the
    lavatory, and meant a further (often desperate) struggle to undo the suspenders and roll
    up the bottom of the girdle. Afterwards of course the whole process had to be repeated in
    reverse, although without the usual 'pee dance' as it would now be called.<br>
    <br>
    Although a small boy, I looked forward to these forays into the (later to be forbidden
    world) of the ladies' lavatories. I quickly became aware of the fact that as the women got
    inside and became close to the opportunity for relief, so they became increasingly
    desperate. I particularly recall one such occasion when visiting the zoo and as usual
    accompanied my mother to the ladies. She was, in her own words, &quot;bursting to spend a
    penny&quot; and with folded arms and crossed legs, kept muttering, &quot;Oh, come
    on!&quot; as the queue inched its way forward. We were only one or two places from the
    front when a middle-aged woman was propelled to the front of the queue and bundled into
    the cubicle, on the grounds that she was &quot;going to have an accident.&quot; My mother
    was furious, and shouted at her, &quot;We're all waiting, you know!&quot; a fact that I
    would have thought was self -evident. When it did become our turn, my mother became quite
    agitated as she tried to close and lock the door behind the two of us in a cubicle only
    made for one. Not long afterwards, I was deemed too grown up to accompany her into the
    ladies' and this pleasure was denied me again until my courting days, but that's another
    story.<br>
    <br>
    In my early teens, my mothers' cousins moved from Belfast to Kingston upon Thames and were
    therefore able to visit us in London from time to time. Uncle Phil and Aunt Emmy had a boy
    around the same age as myself named Winston, presumably in honour of Winston Churchill
    (although he never fulfilled that promise and became a dustman when he grew up). Aunt Emmy
    had a delightfully weak bladder, which cried out to be exploited and one Sunday afternoon
    that opportunity presented itself.<br>
    <br>
    Uncle Phil and Aunt Emmy had come to visit that Sunday afternoon, and the plan was that
    they would take Winston and myself to the pictures (as we called the cinema then) after
    tea. Tea was of course a meal, with sandwiches and cakes, washed down with copious
    quantities of the national drink. As the afternoon wore on, and teapot followed teapot, I
    noted that Aunt Emmy hadn't visited the lavatory - she was always a little embarrassed at
    any mention of such things, and would only sneak away when she thought no one would
    notice. Unfortunately, seated round the dining table as we were, such an opportunity never
    readily presented itself.<br>
    <br>
    When tea was finished, I excused myself on some pretext and made for my bedroom, which was
    just around a turn in the hall next to the only lavatory. I knew it would not be long
    before Aunt Emmy's bladder could no longer be ignored and I was right as I soon heard her
    voice approaching and Uncle Phil replying. This was my cue to slip quickly into the
    lavatory and lock the door, which I achieved before they turned the corner of the hall. I
    heard Uncle Phil saying, &quot;It's just there,&quot; and Auntie Emmy trying the door.
    Then, &quot;Oh dear, there's someone in there,&quot; (although she must have known it was
    me - everyone else was presumably still in the sitting room) &quot;never mind - I'll come
    back later&quot; I heard her say, and her footsteps made off back down the hall.<br>
    <br>
    A minute or two later, I vacated the lavatory, removing the key from the keyhole as I
    went, and positioned myself where I could overhear the conversation. The women in the
    family were chattering happily and five or ten minutes went by before there was a short
    lull in the conversation. I heard Aunt Emmy say, &quot;You'll have to excuse me - I'll
    only be a moment&quot; (how embarrassed she must have been to let everyone know where she
    had to go!). My heart pounded - I knew from long observation that large quantities of tea
    multiplied by lack of toilet visits equalled a proportional degree of desperation. I
    peeped through the crack of my bedroom door and very soon my machinations were well
    rewarded. Aunt Emmy appeared at what could only be described as a fast hobble, handbag
    suspended over left arm and right hand firmly inserted between her thighs. She made it
    into the lavatory and banged the door shut behind her.<br>
    <br>
    It took about a fifth of a second for my eye to get to the keyhole - the view now
    unencumbered by the presence of a key. Only inches from my face, Aunt Emmy had her long
    pleated skirt and black lace-edged slip scrunched up round her waist and was busy undoing
    the black suspenders of her open-bottomed girdle, whilst delightfully jigging up and down
    on the spot. She was wearing a pair of silky French knickers and instead of pulling them
    down, she squatted over the lavatory and pulled the gusset to the side with one hand,
    while holding up her clothes with the other. Hardly had she achieved these manoeuvres when
    she began to pee like a racehorse - a high-pressure stream that hissed out of her and
    seemed to go forever. I found difficulty in breathing, even through my wide-open mouth!
    When she eventually finished, I could hear her sigh through the thickness of the closed
    door.<br>
    <br>
    Later, on the way to the pictures in Uncle Phil's small car, I sat next to Aunt Emmy in
    the back seat. Her stockings rustled under her slip as she crossed her legs and set my
    heart pounding again as I recalled the vision of her, desperately holding herself on the
    way to the lavatory. She's been dead many a long year now, but I can still see her
    grappling frantically with her girdle as clearly as if it were yesterday.<br>
