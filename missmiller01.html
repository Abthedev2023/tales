      lang=EN-US><font face="Arial">It was the beginning of the new year, 
      and the end of our vacation away from the real world. We were on our 
      way back to Virginia, Chris and I, and it was a awful day, dreary and 
      rainy, to match our mood. Neither of us wanted to leave North Carolina 
      and go back to our jobs, to not seeing each other every day. I had 
      decided that morning, after a particularly rousing round of morning 
      sex, that I would indulge Chris's little fetish and not go to the 
      bathroom until we arrived home that evening. I had learned about his 
      fascination with female desperation and wetting a few months before and 
      the idea had started to grow on me. I even found myself getting turned 
      on whenever I had to go, and had discovered that peeing during an 
      orgasm heightened the sensation. Chris liked to say that I had come 
      over to the "yellow side".<br><br>I was always in a constant state of 
      horniness it seemed and it was an almost seven hour car ride, not 
      including how much time we would spend stopping to eat. I knew that my 
      desperation would arouse him and maybe, if I played my cards right, I 
      could get him to compensate me. As we settled into the car for our long 
      journey back to Richmond, I realized I drank three glass of liquid at 
      breakfast, and hadn't peed since 7:30 during our morning romp. It was 
      now almost 10 o'clock and the seven hour car ride seemed daunting, but 
      I was determined. We stopped briefly for some coffee to keep us awake 
      and I knew the twenty ounces of deliciousness would come back to haunt 
      me but I sipped away. About halfway through the ride, I noticed the 
      growing fullness in my bladder, and then immediately the gentle ache 
      deep within my vagina. I shifted a bit, trying to determine whether I 
      was horny or just had the urge to pee, and then decided it was 
      both. Trying to contain my grin, I reached for my jacket in the back 
      seat to cover my lap. Now was the perfect time to play and I wanted to 
      keep Chris guessing as long as possible.<br><br>I spread the coat across my 
      lap and kept one arm tucked underneath and told Chris that was cold and 
      squeezed his hand. He shrugged, unaware of my intentions. I let my seat 
      back a bit and settled down as if to take a nap and slowly started to 
      unbutton my jeans. Then, as quietly as I could, I slid the zipper down 
      and slipped my hand inside. I closed my eyes and stroked the lace 
      covering my mound, holding back a moan. A stole a glance at Chris to 
      make sure he wasn't looking and sure enough, his eyes were glued to the 
      road. Slowly I eased my hand under the fabric and slipped a finger 
      inside my lips, pressing gently on my clit. Either he noticed the 
      movement or I let a sound escape because suddenly the jacket was yanked 
      away and I quickly removed my hand. Chris glanced at me knowingly and 
      shook his head. I grabbed the jacket and insisted I was cold but it was 
      too late, he already knew, which is exactly what I wanted all along.<br>       
      <br>"Horny?" He asked with a sly grin.<br><br>"Always." I replied as I slipped my hand back inside my 
      lacy panties.<br><br>"No." He forced his hand 
      under mine and shoved my fingers up and out. I pouted at him, playing 
      along, and furtively tried to snake my way around his thick, strong hand.<br>
      <br>"I'm bored, horny, and I want to play."<br><br>"This is MY playtoy." He responded.<br><br>"Well, play then." I retorted as I squirmed against his 
      fingers, pressing him into my clit with the hand being denied 
      access. "You'd like that wouldn't you?" 
      He teased.<br><br>And suddenly he 
      was moving against me, his fingers stroking me, rubbing me rhythmically 
      and I cried out in ecstasy clutching his arm. As his pace quickened, I 
      could feel the orgasm build deep inside of me. I steeled myself for the 
      release, knowing full well I couldn't cum (since I was a messy 
      squirter) or else I'd starting pee myself and there was nothing to 
      clean up with. My muscles tightened, my thighs clenching his hand and 
      my nails digging into his forearm. Higher and higher I climbed until 
      suddenly my entire body exploded and waves of ecstasy rolled through 
      every muscle, nerve, and fiber of my being. I quickly grabbed his hand, 
      yanking it away and shook my head. "No. More. Please." I panted. I was 
      spent and my clit was far too sensitive to handle anymore. I sighed and 
      relaxed my clenched muscles as he stroked my thigh, grinning like a 
      little catholic schoolboy who had the pleasure of finishing the communion wine after 
      Mass.<br><br>"Ready for more?"<br><br>I shot him a look, "not yet!" 
      I grinned seductively. "How hard was it to concentrate on driving?"<br><br>"Pretty damn hard. About as hard as my dick right 
      now."<br><br>Not trusting his exaggeration, I reached over his lap and felt 
      for myself. Sure enough, I could feel him straining against the thick 
      jean fabric. Snatching my jacket and tossing it in the back seat, he 
      left me exposed to the passing cars.<br><br>"But what if someone sees me?"<br><br>"I don't care." He shrugged nonchalantly.<br><br>"Too bad we can't 
      have sex right now," I teased. Smiling but<br>without acknowedlging my 
      comment, he changed the subject and I settled down into the seat, still 
      pantless. A bit later, I glanced over and he seemed lost in the road 
      ahead. Horny again, like always, I ventured, "May I have another 
      orgasm?"<br><br>He smiled devilishly, looking me over, pausing on my naked 
      thighs and lace clad vagina. "After lunch. But only if you promise you 
      won't cum or pee while we're in the car. You have to wait until we 
      get home."<br><br>I thought it over, weighing the three plus hours of 
      driving left (plus an hour spent on lunch) coupled with the growing 
      desperation in my groin. Suddenly the pressure in my bladder seemed a 
      bit more pressing. "Fuck it," I thought, "I can do 
      this."<br><br>"Deal!" I 
      practically yelled I was so giddy. His touch was incomparable and there 
      wasn't much I wasn't willing to do to get more of 
      it.<br> <br>After what 
      seemed like an eternity, we found a little diner in Virginia to stop at 
      and eat lunch. I said a little prayer for quick service as we walked 
      in. The pressure was growing, I was still wet from my orgasm, and I 
      ached to be touched again. My prayers, however, went answered as we 
      were met with the most painfully slow service I've ever received. 
      Avoiding my water, Chris, knowing about my growing discomfort, 
      gleefully goaded me to drink more. After what seemed like another 
      eternity, we paid the bill, left with a to-go cup of ice water and got back on 
      the highway.<br><br>Not five minutes were we on the road before I was 
      practically begging Chris to touch me again. He just smiled and nodded, 
      watching as I quickly yanked the jacket over my lap, and then wiggling 
      out of my jeans and underwear. He slowly reached over, caressed my 
      stomach and inched his way down. As he pressed his thick, strong 
      fingers against my aching clit, he glanced over, a surprised look on 
      his face, "holy shit, you're still really wet!"<br><br>I laughed, "I told 
      you!" He shook his head, smiling, and then gave me another mind blowing 
      orgasm. Stopping him again when I simply couldn't handle it, I sighed 
      and inwardly groaned at my bladder. It was nearing its limit and we 
      still at least an hour of driving. A few minutes later, I cursed my sex 
      drive, I was still horny and wanted release. Again. Chris looked at me 
      and knowing what I wanted he made me a proposition. "If you drink all 
      the water in the to-go cup, you can 
      have another orgasm."<br><br>He sat 
      there smiling, feigning concentration on the road. He was being mean 
      and he knew it. But it turned me, him ordering me around, giving me 
      directions, withholding rewards until I did something that satisfied 
      him. As much as I loved being in control of my life, in the bedroom I 
      enjoyed being dominated. I picked up the cup, my bladder balking at the 
      water before I had even taken a sip, and drank every last drop as 
      quickly as I could. Seeing I had finished, Chris reached over and 
      gently pressed on my full bladder, grinning slyly. I shot him a desperate look and his grin deepened.<br><br>"I did my job, now you do yours." 
      And so he did, and I finally felt satiated. Fifteen minutes before we 
      reached home, I started nearing my limit. My bladder ached for release 
      and I knew I wouldn't last much longer. Knowing it would turn him on, I 
      didn't try to hide my growing desperation from Chris. Every bump in the 
      highway sent my muscles clenching and I begged him to avoid the bumpy 
      spots, which only meant that he sought them out after that. By the time 
      we got home and parked, I was ready to bust. I could feel my juices mix 
      with a slight wetness from my bladder and I wondered if I'd even make 
      it in the house.<br><br>"You know you can't use the bathroom, right? You have 
      to pee on me."<br><br>"I don't care where I go, as long 
      as I can go!"<br><br>We rushed inside, leaving our luggage in the car and I ran up 
      the stairs to our bedroom as quickly as I could. Hobbling into 
      the bedroom, I could feel the hot piss slowly try to ease its way out 
      and I crossed my legs, steadying myself against the bed. "Hold on 
      baby, you can go in a minute." He grinned excitedly. Quickly stripping, 
      he spread towels on the floor, and then laid down, looking at me 
      expectantly. I stood there, immobilized, afraid that if I moved I would 
      open the flood gates and piss would start streaming down my legs.<br><br>"Come on baby, it'll be alright, hold yourself if you need 
      to." Sighing, I hobbled over to where he lay, moaning from the 
      pressure that was dying to be released. Planting myself squarely over 
      his stomach, I spread my lips apart and let go. The hot stream bounced 
      off his chest, breaking out in every direction, hitting his face and 
      all I could see through my relief was the look of astonishment on his 
      face. I knew he'd always dreamt of this, and here I was, making his 
      dream come true.<br><br>Moving my hands to the wall to brace myself against 
      the intense pleasure I received from the relief, I emptied my bladder 
      and he watched as the rivers of yellow ran down my legs, soaking the 
      towels beneath him. Collapsing, I lowered myself on top of him, resting 
      my forehead against his wet chest, trying to slow my breathing and 
      I found myself peeing again, directly on his dick. After a moment 
      I lifted my head, 
      smiling at him. He smiled back, "I love you."<br><br>"I 
      know."</font></span></p>
