    </font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie's jeep stopped with screaming
    tires at her sorority dorm. The door on the passenger side swung open immediately, and
    Kitty jumped out; her jeans were thoroughly soaked, she had already peed in her pants on
    two separate occasions but her bladder still wasn't empty - and her need remained. She
    took a few steps towards the dorm, but then looked back to see what was keeping the
    others. Laurie was helping Cathy, who was still crying and sobbing -as she had been all
    through the drive over here-, out of the car. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was trembling, clothed in
    nothing but a soiled T-shirt and her soaking wet panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Will you hurry up!&quot; Kitty
    screamed, &quot;I still have to go, you know!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, you might wet your pants
    every day,&quot; Cathy cried, &quot;but I don't, okay!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy wasn't too ashamed at having
    wet herself, but she was worried about people finding out that she wet herself out of fear
    - that would do serious damage to her butch reputation. Kitty couldn't bear to hold
    herself now her panties and jeans were completely soaked, but she had to fight every
    reflex not to do so. The only reason she had held on until now was because she had let out
    so much already, but she knew the real flood was still to come.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As Laurie and Cathy walked towards
    the dorm, Kitty danced ahead of them with her legs wide constantly. The wet patches in her
    crotch and on her butt felt cold, which really didn't help her bladder control either -
    then, with a loud splat, she pressed her thighs together. She had felt something warm flow
    past her clitoris just then.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh come on,&quot; she begged,
    &quot;Can't you PLEASE hurry up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Why don't you just go to the
    bathroom by yourself?&quot;&nbsp; Laurie asked, amazed by the insensitivity of her friend.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I AM going to the bathroom by
    myself,&quot; Kitty admitted. She doubted for a second, but grabbed her wet crotch anyway.
    It was the only way to keep the rest of her pee from splashing all over the floor. The
    drops that had escaped had brought a new wet glow to the stains already on her jeans, and <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie and Cathy could see the
    imprint of one wet drop running down her leg.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Wait!&quot; Cathy sobbed,
    &quot;what if that thing followed us here? I mean, it followed you to our dorm, didn't
    it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie looked at her and thought
    about what she said; then, she heard a soft, dripping sound; she looked at Kitty's shoes
    and noticed small, yellow drops on the ground near them.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Laurie, PLEASE.&quot; Kitty
    begged her as she bent over, &quot;I'm really losing it now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie, Cathy and Kitty ran into the
    building and onto Kitty and Laurie's room. Kitty was leaving small, wet puddles all over
    the place. Her pee went from drops to a steady beam as the girls started hearing a loud,
    hissing sound when they entered their room. Kitty stumbled into the adjacent bathroom to
    find the first intact toilet she'd seen that evening! As she closed the door and tried to
    unbutton her pants, she crossed her legs to try and keep it back, but to no effect. The
    pee kept streaming out of her, down her legs and even into her shoes, soaking her socks.
    She got her wet pants -that kept sticking to her legs- out eventually and sat down on the
    toilet, not even bothering to take off her once white, now yellowish panties and let all
    the muscles in her body relax. She peed straight trough her panties now; it had absorbed
    all it could, but now the thick urine beam came through with an immense force. Looking
    into her crotch, Kitty noticed you could see through her panties now, they were that wet;
    she saw her pubic hair and her vagina with a slight yellow shine, the same went for her
    butt - her panties seemed glued to her body with wetness. When the peeing stopped and the
    last drops ran down the rim of her panties once more, Kitty took off her jeans and looked
    at them. The blue denim was almost colored black with wetness, and only now she noticed
    the stench she had been spreading all along. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly, she was startled by a
    strange noise; she looked up and could only scream.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie put a dry towel on a chair
    and invited Cathy to sit down. She did so; she had stopped crying, but was still red-faced
    with shame at disgracing herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot;
    Laurie comforted her, &quot;I'll get you some of my clothes, and some washing gear you can
    use. Would you like a beer?&quot; Cathy nodded shyly. Laurie went over to her refrigerator
    and got out a beer; she threw it to Cathy, who caught it out of the air; she was a sports
    girl, after all. Then Laurie went into her bedroom for a minute and came out with a clean
    pair of panties, a pair of short, cotton leggings and a tank top.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I didn't know your size, but
    these are thee only ones I've got that are clean,&quot; she excused herself. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy took the clean clothes in her
    hands and put them on the sink behind her. Then, she stood up straight and took off her
    T-shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll look the other way, if
    you want to,&quot; Laurie suggested.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll be alright.&quot; Cathy
    answered when she also lowered her sticky wet panties, &quot;I'm used to changing rooms
    where all the girls in the team are looking at each other. No problem, really.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Laurie gave Cathy a clean towel and
    a washcloth, and Cathy immediately turned on the faucet there. Laurie crossed her legs
    when she did this.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Do you have to go too?&quot;
    Cathy asked her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ever since we entered the
    biology building,&quot; Laurie admitted, &quot;but I can hold on, don't worry. I just
    wished Kitty would hurry up in there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy waited a moment until the
    water became warm, and then put the washcloth under the faucet. Laurie was hopping from
    one foot to the other. Cathy noticed this and turned off the faucet again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thanks,&quot; Laurie smiled,
    but she still couldn't stand still, &quot;I really wish Kitty would hurry up! I'm starting
    to get desperate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy could see Laurie's bare legs
    fidgeting beneath her skirt, and even the loose blouse she was wearing couldn't hide her
    swollen bladder. While Cathy washed the pee off her vagina and butt, Laurie walked
    nervously towards the bathroom and banged on the door. Her banging was almost immediately
    answered by a loud scream; the girls took a step backwards as the screaming lasted for a
    couple of seconds, then came to a halt. Laurie pressed her thighs firmly together and
    tried the handle on the bathroom door. Luckily, Kitty was so desperate that she had
    forgotten to lock the door. With the last of her courage, Laurie opened the door and saw
    the same scene she saw in Cathy's dorm and in the biology building. The toilet was ripped
    from the floor and Kitty was nowhere to be seen. As water was spraying everywhere, Laurie
    didn't even think about her throbbing bladder; she saw a hole in the ceiling, and out of
    the dark void beyond she heard a distinct, feral growl.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Laurie
    panicked, &quot;it's here! We have to get out of here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What?&quot; Cathy asked; she
    was still standing there naked, now drying herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Grab the clothes and run after
    me!&quot; Laurie yelled as she made for the door. Cathy heard a loud bang from the
    bathroom; she grabbed the clothes Laurie had given her and ran after her. As the girls
    made it back to the jeep, they heard a howling from inside the dorm that must have come
    from the creature. Cathy threw the towel she was carrying into the seat she had wet
    earlier and placed her bare bottom there as Laurie started the car and drove off once
    again. Only now, when they were relatively safe, Laurie noticed how bad she had to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Cathy
    asked as she put on the fresh pair of panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I've had worse,&quot; Laurie
    answered, pushing back her tears and biting her lip in desperation, &quot;at least, I'm
    not desperate enough to squat in the middle of a grass field, if that's what you
    mean.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cathy smiled knowingly and put on
    the tank top she had borrowed. &quot;Where are we going anyway?&quot; she asked, partially
    to change the subject.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;The biology building,&quot;
    Laurie answered, &quot;that's where all this started, so it must be where that creature
    has taken Kitty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Seeing Laurie fidget in her seat,
    trying to keep her concentration on the road, made her remember something not entirely
    unimportant too. &quot;Laurie,&quot; she said, &quot;I have to admit something to
    you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What?&quot; Laurie asked
    distracted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well,&quot; Cathy shifted in
    her seat, &quot;beer always goes straight through me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">TO BE CONTINUED.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
