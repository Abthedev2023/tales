    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The elevator door opened and Ashley
    walked with hesitant steps into the opulent headquarters of Rainwater &amp; Associates
    firmly clutching her resume, her immaculately tailored dark blue skirt and jacket,
    expensive white blouse and high heel pumps- the outfit de rigueur for the position of
    executive secretary she hoped to land. Her long flowing locks of red hair had been tied
    back and expertly braided, all giving what she hoped was a professional persona that
    belied her twenty one years. Ushered into the sanctum of the inner office, she sat
    nervously as L.P. Rainwater, the founder and CEO studied every line of her application.
    Finally the CEO from central casting looked up and took his reading glasses off.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Clearly you look qualified for
    the job, Miss Thompson. Congratulations. I'll have Julie give you the grand tour of our
    office. You can see her on the way out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ashley could scarcely conceal a
    small cheer as she greeted the receptionist. &quot;I got it!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The petite brunette smiled and barely looked up
    from her computer.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I knew you would. And the
    sooner you relax and realize what a fun, non-conformist bunch we are the better. Don't let
    the Mahogany wood-paneling fool you,&quot; she winked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All too soon Ashley found out just
    what she meant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A short tour of the floor
    found a largely female staff in high spirits, engaging in a myriad of various job
    functions within work cubicles. Nearing the end of the tour, Julie led her down a hallway.
    &quot;Remember, I told you we're a fun non-conformist group. This is what I meant. Ashley,
    this is our restroom.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On the door were two figures
    depicting both male and female sexes. A co-ed restroom!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;I know- I was taken aback on my first day too. But come on in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Inside was a restroom constructed
    with fixtures and a marble floor commensurate with the building materials in the rest of
    the office. But Ashley almost blushed as she saw one fixture definitely unfamiliar to a
    woman's room, a minimally portioned men's urinal next to the twin sinks in wide-open view
    to one and all. On the opposite side were four conventional stalls albeit with a
    disconcertingly high gap between the floor and the bottom of the stall door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Julie opened a stall door. &quot;Get a look at
    this; bet you've never seen a joke john before.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ashley looked in amazement at the
    inside of the toilet stall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the inside of
    the stall door was a mirror with a sign above reading, &quot;smile if you have a furry
    one.&quot; Lining the stall were humorous if semi-obscene framed pictures, cartoons and a
    one by three foot framed poem entitled Ode To Peeing. The other three stalls had different
    but equally shocking humor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;It takes some getting used to.
    The boss says he was just trying out an idea he saw from that hit TV show where there's a
    co-ed restroom. And he claims that since we are an almost completely female firm, the few
    men didn't want to take the time to go to another floor. But...if you want to know what I
    really think, come with us girls after work.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At five o'clock, Ashley joined Julie
    and two other women of the firm at a nearby restaurant/ lounge. That day had proved to her
    that this job was a going to be definite positive in her budding career. Girl talk grew
    looser as the effect of the drinks took hold of the foursome. Finally, curiosity got the
    best of her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hey, I thought you were going
    to tell me something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What is up with the
    co-ed restroom?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would somebody please tell me
    something?&quot; The other three dissolved into self-conscious giggles.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What's wrong?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shy about displaying your bladder skills?&quot;
    inquired Sandra. Twenty-eight year-old Karen was more succinct.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll put it to you this way.
    Our CEO's last name is Rainwater for good reason; and the L.P. in his name...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yeah, it stands for long
    pisser. Long pisser!&quot; Julie finished the thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Sandra
    shot back. &quot;I was in the bathroom one time trying to be quiet when he comes in and
    pulls out that huge dangler of his and starts up. Well I waited and I waited, and I swear
    that guy just would not stop going. What's really hilarious is that Kathryn from
    accounting came in and he was still standing there with that incredible hose pouring out.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The poor thing went into a stall, did her thing,
    and like me...waited for him to get through and leave so she could freshen up at the
    adjacent sink. Except... he didn't. It got so ridiculously long I couldn't stand it
    anymore, so I left my stall with as much dignity as I could muster.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get this, as I'm leaving he turned to me and asked
    if I could call an important client of ours and tell them that he would be delayed for
    awhile in a meeting. Girls, the only delay I could ever figure out was caused by the
    endless stream coming out of that world class winger of his.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'd have stayed and timed
    him,&quot; countered Julie.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Then measured him,&quot; added
    Karen with a laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;My whole theory of that
    restroom is that it provides a somewhat acceptable, if you could call it that, forum to
    show off his massive bladder and penis,&quot; said Sandra with a shake of her head.
    &quot;He's like a little boy showing-off to all the others that he's the king ruminator,
    the biggest and the best with the longest penis.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Slowly, Julie nodded her head.
    &quot;Right. But now he's a CEO in a Brioni suit...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Holding her hands far apart, Karen
    quipped, &quot;with a foot-long fire hose!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ashley took in the threesome's
    conversation in stunned silence for a number of reasons she was not yet ready or relaxed
    enough to divulge to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Over dinner the foursome shared
    numerous intimacies only single career women could share, and they enjoyed more laughter
    and stories with dinner drinks. Only on the way out did Julie suddenly confess her need.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sorry folks, but I really have
    to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Really!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I the only one?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No, my tank is on full as
    well,&quot; admitted Karen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That makes three of us. How
    about you Ashley?&quot; asked Sandra.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The tall redhead thought for a
    moment before adding, &quot;sure I guess I could go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Then how about we four making
    a beeline for our infamous restroom,&quot; concluded Julie.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Walking into the empty office
    building, the group chatted freely as they entered the restroom after hours and thus safe
    from any male intrusion. They each strode into their respective stalls and in almost
    simultaneous unison began the task of empting their bladders. Within the restroom, a
    symphony of splatter commenced, each with a slight variation unique to each woman's peeing
    style; Karen a steady spray, Julie a staccato-like splatter, while at each end, Sandra and
    Ashley peed away in steady heavy and heavier streams respectively. It was Sandra who
    brought up the long forgotten topic of conversation earlier in the evening.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You know it's a damn shame we
    can't do something,&quot; she voiced up amidst the splatter of urine.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Do something about what,&quot;
    said Julie sending a particularly powerful burst into the water below?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Put old L.P. Rainwater in his
    place,&quot; replied Sandra.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Two stalls over, Karen called out,
    &quot;and what are we supposed to do to accomplish this feat?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Only a crazy thought. It's
    just that the big blowhard uses that urinal as his exhibitionistic stage every time he
    comes in here. Whether they verbalize it or not, every woman at this firm who uses this
    restroom has seen him standing way back, in full view with that big dong of his hanging
    half way to his knees, peeing away until...until the damn cows come home.&quot; The four
    peed in silence for another half minute before petite Julie's stream tapered-off.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well whatever you have in
    mind, I don't think I have the particular qualifications that you're looking for.&quot;
    She quickly tissued, flushed, and retired to the sink area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Her departure left a minor variation and drop in the decibel output, ignored
    by the peeing trio. Karen pressed the issue.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I want to know. What do you
    have in mind? All night we seem to have been talking about L.P. and his giant dick peeing
    forever.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Forget it,&quot; said Sandra.
    &quot;It was too wild a thought and besides we could never find a female who was capable
    of pulling it off.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Just then Karen's flow dried up and
    she too left her stall to join Julie by the sink.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OK then, woman of mystery. Be
    that way. Meet you at the mirror when you're through.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The words had barely left her mouth
    when Sandra's bladder had totally depleted its contents.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Karen took out a brush while Sandra
    reached in her bag for some lipstick.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You have me really curious.
    Let me in. What are you thinking about?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes,&quot; added Julie to the
    mix, &quot;what the hell plan do you have for Long Pisser Rainwater?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Taking a deep breath Sandra sighed,
    &quot;Just for fun, just for revenge, just for the prestige of all we women, wouldn't it
    be delicious if we could give him back an ounce, or more appropriately, a gallon, of his
    own medicine? I would give anything to see his expression if, just once, he came in here
    filled to the max and met his female match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
    would he feel if he met his, should we say, Waterloo?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The three laughed at her corny pun.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sounds kinky and I love it.
    Too bad it can't happen,&quot; Julie answered wistfully.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The longtime friends and associates
    gathered their belongings to leave the restroom when they became aware of a sound, a
    steady sound, like water from a faucet cascading down to a partially filled sink, except
    in this case it was coming from the direction of the corner stall.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Hey you guys, wait. Ashley's
    not done yet,&quot; whispered Karen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The three promptly aborted their
    departure out of courtesy for the newest member of the group. Julie and Sandra placed
    their handbags on the marble counter top while Sandra rummaged in hers for more hair
    spray. Out of conversation, the atmosphere within the restroom took on an odd quiescence
    save for the steady droning of pee into toilet water. It was very steady and very strong,
    with no indication of letting up anytime soon. Sandra caught Julie's raised eyebrows.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Shah. Don't say anything.
    Let's see what happens.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Instinctively, Karen looked at her
    watch. &quot;Believe it or not people, it's eight minutes and running.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Quiet. You'll embarrass
    her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From within the stall a voice
    suddenly chimed in. &quot;Hello. Anybody still here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We most certainly are still
    here Miss Thompson,&quot; chortled Julie. &quot;And positively enthralled and
    impressed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Good. Sorry I take so long.
    Whoa pee stream!&quot; Her words came out more like an innocent taken aback by her own
    powers and abilities rather than a poised young woman. Outside the trio stood mesmerized
    as more time passed and she continued with her odd confession.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Gee. You were all talking
    about our boss and all I could think of was, gosh, you mean there's someone else like me
    out there? I'm not the only one who floods the toilet forever and ever?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A seeming eternity later she came
    out of the stall to face the speechless trio.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That's 'sure I guess I could
    go?'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My dear do we ever have a request of you
    and I hope you're uninhibited and deliciously evil. Do us this one little favor. For all
    the women at this company.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Chapter Two<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Can't we wrap up this
    meeting,&quot; complained L.P. &quot;Why it must be close to five-thirty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The silver haired executive shifted
    uncomfortably in his seat at the head of the long conference table.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Midway down the row of chairs, Sandra, Julie,
    Karen and Ashley shot knowing glances. L.P. hadn't visited the restroom the entire day
    that they were sure of. He must be bursting for a pee, reasoned Karen. She and her tight
    cadre of girlfriends had made certain of that with a steady flow of coffee and bottled
    water sent to his office throughout the day. As for Ashley, understandable reticence had
    given way to mischievous enthusiasm and a determination to fill her own giant internal
    reservoir as full as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would not
    let her new friends down as wild and kinky as their plan was. Not if she could help it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Alright, folks. Any other
    questions can wait until morning. Have a good evening.&quot; With that final comment, L.P.
    rose from his leather chair and left the room.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ashley, give him a little time
    to walk in the restroom and unzip; then follow him in, &quot; urged Sandra. The suggestion
    was essentially moot as the CEO walked briskly with a perceptible urgency toward the
    restroom with the foursome in discreet trail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    the door closed behind him Julie held up her arm, paused, and then melodramatically
    announced, &quot;lights, camera and action!&quot; In her present bladder state, it was a
    needless call to action. Ashley opened the restroom door and walked in just as the first
    drops poured out of his penis into the white porcelain of the urinal. Even from her
    peripheral vision she could see that, if anything, her co-workers had understated his
    endowment. How could a man store and conceal something so large in his pants, she thought.
    However mystifying a question that may have been took a backseat to both her need and the
    awkwardness of the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh dear, I'm so sorry sir!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had no idea anybody was in here. The meeting
    went on so long that I have to use the facilities.&quot; She blushed as she walked past
    him in a blur of high heel pumps and intoxicating perfume he attempted to ignore. He
    turned his head to view the long limbed lass.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;My dear girl, there's no need
    to apologize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, urination is just a
    natural bodily function. We at Rainwater &amp; Associates have this co-ed restroom as
    proof of that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She noted that the conceited bastard
    made no effort to hide himself as he spoke. From her position diagonally to his left, she
    could plainly see the twisted stream spew forth from the head of his so aptly named fire
    hose and hit the wall of the urinal. The glans remained partially covered with foreskin
    and, surprising to Ashley in light of its length was the slack flaccid appearance of the
    shaft. Any mysteries of Rainwater's organ took a backseat as an overfilled bladder
    suddenly called for relief.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;In that case sir, I shall put
    these facilities to good use then.&quot; She beamed a smile and made deliberate eye
    contact as she opened the stall door up, using sheer force of will not to look down at the
    huge appendage hanging out of his trousers. Quite a departure in attitude from most of his
    female employees, thought L.P., refreshingly different. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">If he needed any further
    confirmation, soon the marble tile, the mirror and the ceiling all resonated with a
    thundering sound uniquely female in origin, only more so. Ashley's urine stream beat down
    directly into the water of the deep commode, which acted to amplify it many fold. As he
    silently hissed about his business, to his rear the steady drone continued and continued,
    well past the usual time of exhaustion that other women at the office demonstrated.
    Clearly this beautiful &quot;filly&quot; could pee. He smiled as he looked at the constant
    stream emanating from his own source while simultaneously perking his ears for the
    expectant termination of sound that would surely come at any moment. Just then he did
    something he had not done in years since he was a lad at summer camp. He checked his
    watch! Thirty, sixty, ninety seconds passed and still the steady flow of female urination
    remained. Constant, loud, and persistent. Two minutes, two thirty...three minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A
    soothing voice, a young woman's voice reached his ears just then like pure honey. Speaking
    above the din of her self-made waterfall. &quot;Mr. Rainwater, are you still out
    there?&quot; That voice sent an odd jolt of emotion throughout his body.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Why, ah, yes Miss Thompson. I
    am. May I help you?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I hate to trouble you, but
    could you go over the phraseology you want me to write for the Peterson account one more
    time?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Miss Thompson, the precise
    nuance is very important, and going over it is too time consuming to go over now.&quot;
    For ten seconds there was silence but for the pulsating of urine into the toilet bowl.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mr. Rainwater, I realize
    you're a busy man during the day, and without sounding too crass; well let's just say I
    know I have plenty of time left in here. Do you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The very implication of her words
    struck him like a stiletto and he fought off deeply repressed carnal thoughts as his organ
    engorged with blood and his stream tapered off. Her innuendo filled the air with a sexual
    electricity he was not quite sure how to respond to.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Miss Thompson, I...I,&quot; he
    stammered totally out of character. Fortunately, she cut him off.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please, please accept my
    sincere apology, sir. That must have sounded so juvenile. I didn't mean for it to come out
    that way.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So beautiful, fresh and innocent a
    woman behind that door he thought. And exciting.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't be absurd. There is
    nothing to apologize for, Ashley. May I call you Ashley?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her reply came back especially sugar
    coated. &quot;But of course sir.&quot; Then, above the sound of endlessly pee she added,
    &quot;I might add that it's rare that I have the privilege of such handsome company.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And for this amount of time.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Again!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This time he was positive. She was teasing him,
    taunting him and laying down the gauntlet just like in his school days long ago. A peeing
    contest!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only instead of intoxicated
    fraternity members here was a gorgeous young thing who sounded like a virtual peeing
    machine, an inexhaustible supply spewing out in a never-ending stream. He looked down as
    the last drops fell from his penis and listened helplessly but hypnotized to the sounds
    behind him. A monstrous erection arced before him and touched the wall of the urinal.
    Incredible. How was it possible to feel such excitement from urinary defeat at the hands,
    or bladder of this incredible woman? Shamelessly, L.P. closed his eyes and stroked himself
    to the surreal sounds.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My goodness sir!!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandra, Karen and Julie stood in the entranceway
    in feigned astonishment looking at their CEO furiously masturbating.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ladies. Please, you don't
    understand. Ladies, please!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We can come to an
