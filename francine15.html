    <br>
    The hotel ballroom was filling with over four hundred attendees, as the annual convention
    of the International Society of Structural Design came to its closing event. For ten days
    attendees had participated in technical and business sessions, and now they came to the
    concluding time of their yearly gathering. They came from all over the world to this hotel
    in Northern Europe, to exchange ideas,to engage in seemingly endless presentations of
    technical papers, to view innumerable exhibits, participate in society business, and just
    enjoy each other. It was almost all business, until tonight. This was the time to relax,
    to have fun, to end on a friendly note and carry away those great memories while looking
    to what would await them at their next venue a year hence.<br>
    <br>
    They came in numbers, using snatches of numerous languages, though all could manage the
    English that was the common vehicle of their business. Perhaps a third were spouses of
    delegates, both male and female, while the delegates themselves were industry
    professionals or interested observers. In this prestigious group, most of the members were
    thirty or over, though there were a few younger, and some were much older. All seemed well
    educated, well dressed, and now smiling, looking to an evening of food,wine, and a bit of
    fun.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne Dexter approached a table, accompanying her husband, Greg, who had been ten years
    a member of the society and several times an attendee at the convention. Behind them came
    Freida Dussenberg, employed by an architectural firm of Dusseldorf, accompanied by her
    husband, Hans. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Shall we sit here? This has a good view of the stage&quot;, asked Marianne of her
    companions. In seeming agreement, all four of them quickly took places at the table, set
    for ten. <br>
    <br>
    Behind them quickly came another couple, conversing in French, until the gentleman
    politely asked in excellent English if they might join the group. Introductions were
    exchanged.<br>
    <br>
    An older couple then approached the table, asking by exchange of glances if they might be
    seated. Those already there quickly nodded smilingly. Suddenly Greg expressed recognition.
    &quot;Say, aren't you Art Montfort, our Society Vice President?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The older man acknowledged the greeting with a nod, and added, &quot;That is my privilege,
    but you might say retiring Vice President, as I won't have that title after tonight. May I
    present my wife Sylvia?&quot; A rather elegant looking,quite tall gray haired lady at his
    side beamed at them, and extended her hand in greeting to those around. &quot;My third
    convention! Art's been coming to them for at least twenty years, but I've had my own
    business and that tied me up most of the time. However, I did break loose long enough to
    make it for his last hurrah as a Society officer. It's been a great week for me. How about
    all of you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The group exchanged impressions and experiences of the last few days, as they were joined
    by two others, a man and a woman, though apparently not together, as the tables filled. <br>
    <br>
    Hans looked at Art intently at one point, and then observed, &quot;Weren't you the one
    they honored for distinguished service to the membership at the business session
    Wednesday? I really shouldn't have been there, but I accompanied Freida; and I just
    couldn't forget the accolades they heaped on you. We're fortunate to be in your
    company!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, that was me&quot;, Art answered. &quot;But they really overdid it. I think they
    were really celebrating the end of my service and the opportunity to see someone new take
    the job!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not the way I heard it&quot;, Greg chimed in. &quot;I've seen you at all these I've
    come to. Let's see, it's G. Arthur Montfort, isn't it? You've got quite a record, which I
    can envy. By the way, I always wondered what the 'G' was for?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia laughed. &quot;Guisseppe! Guisseppe Arthur Montfort!&nbsp; Can you believe it? I
    think he hates it when I tell on him?&quot; Her steel gray hair shook a bit with her
    laughter as she turned to her husband, who seemed to shy from her response.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sylvia told on me. It's, in a way, an heirloom. My mother was from an Italian
    family, and her parents insisted that their grandson should have an Italian name. My
    parents obliged them and saddled me with it; but they never used it, and neither do
    I!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's a perfectly good name. You shouldn't be ashamed of it!&quot; commented
    Marianne.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;A great American name&quot;, Sylvia added. &quot;We Americans are mostly a mix of
    who knows what. Art just didn't see it that way. So we just call him Art!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The conversation went on for a time, until Helga, the woman who had come alone to the
    table, asked about the entertainment for the evening. &quot;I understand that after the
    ceremonial things, we have an exciting evening ahead. After we stuff ourselves on this
    meal, I hear there will be a some specialty acts brought in for us! &quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes&quot;, Hans added. &quot;They always seem to come up with some local color in
    the entertainment. I'm not sure what they will be tonight, but always they have been good.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne was quick to add, &quot;It's not the entertainers they bring in that is really
    the most exciting part; usually it's the audience participation thing they do each time.
    That's really wild! And I don't have a clue what it will be tonight!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh?&quot; asked Helga. &quot;What do they do?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Greg explained. &quot;At each banquet, there's a committee that plans some sort of game or
    contest, something of an icebreaker. It's intended to be fun, but, as Marianne says, it
    can get a bit wild. But I think everyone has enjoyed it! One rule is no one is ever
    pressured into participation, but everyone gets to watch. I have to say, they've been
    getting wilder and wilder. Who knows what they'll come up with tonight!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Freida broke into a big smile. &quot;Last year they did a crazy thing! They had a contest;
    remember the underwear event? It was, as you say, wild. But it was fun. Even for those who
    participated, it was fun!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Did you?&quot; Marianne asked of Freida.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm not telling.&quot; Freida answered, a bit shyly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What on earth was it?&quot; asked Helga.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tell her, Marianne, since you seemed to enjoy it!&quot; Art prompted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; Marianne began, &quot;they had this contest. There was a good prize,
    mind you, so that made it worth while. The prize was to go to the first man who could get
    up to the stage with two sets of women's underwear, two panties and two bras! And you know
    where he was going to get them from!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes&quot;, Freida went on, &quot;And there were prizes for the runner-up and the
    second runner-up! And then, the funniest thing, they made the winners identify the women
    they had got the things from, and made them come up to get prizes, too!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes&quot;, continued Marianne, &quot;but after everyone knew who the women were, and
    I think there were about eight or nine of them altogether, they had to leave their
    underwear on display on the stage for the rest of evening, and then they could retrieve
    the items. Everyone knew they were minus panties or bras throughout the evening. Some of
    them were blushing red most of the evening!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I hear&quot;, spoke the gentlemen who had come alone, &quot;that they have a much
    wilder event planned for tonight. It is, in fact, so wild they will require women to
    volunteer if they want to participate, and there's a lot of doubt if they will. I'm told
    there's a back-up plan if they don't get enough!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The French-speaking couple smiled at each other. The lady spoke. &quot;Allow me, I am
    Michelle Durant, and this is my husband, Paul. We had heard of the game last year, and I
    had asked about this year. I was told something of the same thing! It will be interesting,
    indeed!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia turned to Art. &quot;Do you know what they're going to do? You're in on most
    things! I love the fun things, if they just don't go too far. Give us a hint?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art hesitated. &quot;Well, yes, I've heard about the game, but I don't know if it's a go.
    If they do what was talked about, it's plenty wild, and they might not get enough
    participation. It has to be voluntary, you know. It's the kind of thing they couldn't do
    in a lot of places, but here they seem to have an OK for it, as long as it's confined to
    the guests in the ballroom!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aren't you going to tell us?&quot; asked Helga. Marianne, too, looked at Art with
    curiosity.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm not really supposed to.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Just a hint?&quot; Marianne insisted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not supposed to. But, well, OK, you're all at the table and it will be announced in
    a few minutes anyway. OK, what they've proposed will be called, if they go through with
    it, 'The Lady Godiva Game' and it will involve a sort of lottery in which women who
    volunteer will have their names drawn, for the honor of playing 'Lady Godiva' for the
    evening. That's all I'm going to tell you!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Lady Godiva&quot;, Helga mused, &quot;wasn't she the one who rode naked through the
    town in some kind of protest?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You got it!&quot; Marianne observed. &quot;Does this mean some female is going to be
    drawn for the privilege of riding around with her clothes off?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art shook his head. &quot;No more comment. You'll hear if they decide to do it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The guests debated the possibilities, as the event was called to order and the presiding
    officer gave a welcome to the attendees and invited guests, and went through a litany of
    thanks to those who had organized the events and were otherwise being honored. <br>
    <br>
    After the opening ceremonies, the presiding officer then introduced an official as
    Chairman of the Entertainment Committee. This official then took the chair, and explained
    that several events featuring local talent would be performed for the gathering after
    dinner and after some preliminary things were done. Then, he announced, &quot;Some of you
    have been expressing interest in what we call 'The Game', which we do each year. A number
    of you look forward to this each year, and for this year the Committee has organized an
    event which promises to be memorable. Some of you recall the 'game' of last year! In that
    one, several of the ladies relinquished some of their attire to enable a male contestant
    to win a prize. Many of you liked the idea, and while we were surprised at the number of
    female attendees who enjoyed the event, some of them said it seemed unfair because the
    winners, who were men, weren't the ones who had to give up anything. So, tonight, we've
    arranged something different. Tonight's event will have a female prize winner, and just
    one. The prize will go to the winner, if she complies with the rules, and everyone else
    will have to do little but watch. Yes, watch! And it should be quite a show! That is, if
    we have enough participants to allow us to do it! We will call this one, 'The Lady Godiva
    Game' &quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne almost burst out laughing. She turned to her table mates. &quot;See? They're
    really going to do it! Oh, I can't wait to see this!&quot; Michelle also smiled.
    &quot;Yes, it is as I had heard!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The speaker went on. &quot;This event is just for the ladies. Men, sorry, but you can't
    win the prize on this one, so don't even try. All you can do is encourage your lady to put
    her name in the hat, and she wins, maybe she'll share the prize with you. The prize,
    incidentally, is the equivalent of two thousand US dollars, which we will give to the
    winner at the end of the evening - if she has met all the rules.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now, here are the rules. On each table is a set of cards. No woman is required to
    participate, remember. You can each choose to enter or not to. There are about four
    hundred and forty of us here, including almost two hundred women, so we've decided that
    the event will go on only if we have at least one hundred female entrants. That guarantees
    that no one will have a chance of more than one in one hundred of being chosen. The chosen
    one will be known as 'Lady Godiva'for the evening. Some of you can guess why, already.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Next, we will have the committee members pass around the room with baskets, and any
    female person present may write her name and table number on a card and drop it in the
    basket. Before dropping it in, you must show it to others at your table so they will know
    you are submitting you own name, and not someone else's. We will collect all of the cards
    and thoroughly mix them in a large glass bowl. Before dessert is served, one name will be
    drawn. The lady selected will be asked to stand and identify herself, then return to her
    place for dessert and coffee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;After coffee is served, we will call forward our Lady Godiva who will come up to the
    stage, where she will be introduced to all of you, and will have an opportunity to speak
    to you. Then, she will be asked to remove all of her clothes, everything she has on, and
    leave them hanging on the coat tree at the side of the stage. Then, she will descend and
    move to the tables in the room. For the remainder of the evening, she will circulate among
    the tables, and at each table she will turn around, display herself, and stay at the table
    long enough to have a drink of something with those seated there. Someone will use a pen
    and sign his or her name and the table number on her stomach, or , er, seat. She will then
    go to the next table. We will proceed with the evening's entertainment while she
    circulates. If she manages to get through all the tables, and there are 45 of them, before
    the evening ends, which will give her about two to three hours, and doesn't leave the room
    , she gets the full prize. I think she will have earned it! <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ladies, you can decide whether to enter! We will be collecting the cards in about
    half an hour, so you have some time to decide. Remember, if we don't get at least a
    hundred, we will not go on with it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The room immediately erupted into a cacophony of conversation as excited attendees began
    to discuss the game.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne was ecstatic. &quot;I think it's great! It's really wild! But I'm not going to
    enter - I couldn't do anything like that. I just want to watch!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helga was lukewarm. &quot;I know it's all in fun. But, to put yourself on exhibit like
    that - naked, no less! Maybe I'll take a chance. But I sure hope I'm not the winner. Not
    even for two thousand dollars!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Paul looked at Michelle. &quot;And, will you enter your name? It was you who told me this
    would happen!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Michelle nodded. &quot;But of course! The chance of being chosen is so small! But we must
    see who it will be. It would be a pity if there were not enough to enter!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But not for me! I just couldn't!&quot; Marianne insisted. Freida nodded in seeming
    agreement.<br>
    <br>
    Art tried to intervene. &quot;No one has to participate. I really don't think they will
    get enough women to offer their names. I can't imagine that many women would want to do
    this!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    His wife was unenthusiastic. &quot;I think it's in very bad taste. In fact, it's just
    awful. The underwear game last<br>
    time was fun, in a way, but this! Anyway, I'm sure no one would want me to be a winner,
    anyway, at my age!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Which is?&quot; Marianne inquired. Greg tried to cut her off &quot;Marianne, you
    don't ask that!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sixty three&quot;, Sylvia responded without hesitation.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And she's not ashamed of it, Greg!&quot; Marianne responded. &quot;I'm forty three,
    and I hope I look like you when I'm sixty three!&quot; she looked smilingly at Sylvia.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you&quot;, Sylvia countered. &quot;Still, I'm hardly the age for this sort of
    game.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The conversation went on for a time. All of them looked at the group of cards on the
    table, as the waiters brought appetizers and salads.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, who's going to be the first?&quot; asked Helga, eyeing the cards after the
    discussion died down.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Looks like no one&quot; Marianne observed, &quot;unless Michelle wants to
    start!&quot; She looked at Michelle.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, I will enter my name, with a prayer that it won't be drawn! But, I fear you are
    right. There will not be enough volunteers. Yes, I will do it; but only because I feel
    sure I won't be chosen. Really, I don't think there will be enough to enter their
    names.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Then the game is off&quot;, commented Greg, with a shrug. &quot;Wonder what they've
    got for a back up?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Pity&quot;, said Freida &quot;I think a lot of us wanted to see it go on, we just
    didn't want to be chosen!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    After a bit of silence, Sylvia reached forward, took a card, and began to write on it.<br>
    <br>
    Her husband stared at her. &quot;What are you doing ? volunteering me? You won't get away
    with it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No&quot;, Sylvia answered in a matter of fact way, &quot;I'm offering my name. Even
    though everyone, especially me, will be sorry if I'm drawn.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In heaven's name why?&quot; her husband asked, his tonation rising.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You don't need to do that&quot;, Marianne implored her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Of course I don't. And I still think the game is in terrible taste. They should
    never do anything like this, and I feel sorry for whoever is chosen. But this is the event
    they've come up with, and a lot of people look forward to this as a fun time. There are
    over four hundred people here just expecting a good time. No one is planning to make it
    difficult for whoever is drawn, and the chance of being drawn is slight, anyway. But I
    came here as a guest, Art is an officer of this body, and we need to support the committee
    who planned this, even if we think their idea is not terribly good. I would absolutely
    hate to be chosen, but we're going to ruin an evening for a lot of people if we don't give
    it a chance. After all, most of us are going to leave tomorrow, and the people here, for
    the most part, aren't ones you're going to see for another year, if ever, so it's not
    going to ruin you in front of all your friends. Art, how would it look if your own wife
    wouldn't participate, after all the recognition they've heaped on you? We're supposed to
    support this organization, and that includes the Entertainment Committee, even when they
    have distasteful ideas. Frankly, I think it's disgusting, but, yes, I'll offer my
    name!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The others looked at each other, as Sylvia completed the card. She wrote her name on it in
    a large feminine script, and showed it to the others. Michelle displayed the card on which
    her own name had been inscribed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, not for me&quot; Freida commented, clearly not writing anything.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Nor me! But, in a way, I think Sylvia's right. I just don't have the nerve to do
    it!&quot; Helga joined in.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne hesitated, her face strained. She looked at the cards, then at Sylvia. Nervously,
    she reached for a card. &quot;Sylvia's right - we've all participated in the events this
    week, and we need to take a chance on this, even if we don't like the idea. We shouldn't
    spoil the party. The odds are pretty heavy against being chosen! I'm going to put in my
    name. If Sylvia can do it, I can.&quot; She took her card and began writing, looking at
    her husband for his response.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For your sake, not everybody else's, I have to admit, I hope you're not the choice.
    But it's for you to decide!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art grasped for something to say after his wife's declared intention, but for once seemed
    at a loss for words. He sat in silence, gently shaking his head.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly, the baskets began to circulate, carried by committee members. As a basket
    approached, the women who had completed cards held them up for collection. Marianne
    dropped hers in, with a long sigh. &quot;See?&quot; she said to Greg, &quot;I did do it!
    Now you can hope they pick someone else!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The meal went on, with only occasional references to the impending drawing. The
    conversation shifted to other matters as the courses were served. Each table was supplied
    with both wine and water, and the guests were clearly enjoying both. By the end of the
    main course, the effects on several of the wine drinkers was evident. The atmosphere was
    relaxed as the main course dishes were removed.<br>
    <br>
    At this point, attention was drawn to the stage, where a large glass bowl had been
    positioned on a small table covered with a white cloth.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; the announcement began, &quot;we now come to the event
    we had explained earlier. We have counted the cards offered by the ladies who were willing
    to volunteer. As you will recall, there must be a minimum of one hundred women entering,
    or we will not go ahead with the drawing.&quot; He turned to two people, a man and a
    woman, standing at the side of the stage. &quot;Has the counting committee done it's
    task?&quot; he asked of them.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; the woman responded. &quot;We have counted the cards twice, in
    fact.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And there are?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Exactly one hundred and two names.&quot; she responded, slowly and clearly.<br>
    <br>
    A cheer went up from the tables, reflecting the news that the number was sufficient to
    proceed. Marianne put her hands to her face. &quot;Oh no! &quot; she said, in mock terror,
    &quot;Someone's going to be drawn!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A murmur arose in the room as the impact of the number was assimilated. There would indeed
    be a Lady Godiva. Now, everyone was concerned, who would she be? <br>
    <br>
    The Master of Ceremonies continued. &quot;It seems, ladies and gentlemen, that we can
    proceed with the drawing! Does everyone understand the implications? The lady drawn will
    be our Lady Godiva for the evening: she will come up here, discard her clothing, and then
    circulate among the tables for the rest of the evening. If she gets through all the
    tables, showing herself and sharing a drink at each, and doesn't leave the room until the
    end of the evening, she gets the cash prize. Any questions?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He looked about the room. No hands were raised, no one stood up. The murmurs ceased.
    Attention was about to be focused on the drawing.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Then, ladies and gentlemen&quot;, he continued, shall we proceed to draw the name of
    the lucky winner? Shall we see which lovely lady will be invited to display her charms in
    the most complete way?&quot; He motioned to to a man who was seated at a nearby table.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The number will be drawn by Peter Vandemeer, our esteemed Past President. But-
    &quot; he went on, &quot;to assure that Peter shows no prejudice in his selection, and
    that the choice will be completely by chance&quot;, he motioned to the two members of the
    counting committee, &quot;He will be blindfolded!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The two counters approached him as he entered the stage. The lady placed a large black
    blindfold was over his eyes and tied it in place. Meanwhile, the man stirred the cards in
    the glass dish with a long stick. <br>
    <br>
    The M. C. continued. &quot;Now, Peter, you have the honor of selecting the lucky lady who
    will be our Lady Godiva of the evening. Once you have drawn a card, we will read the name,
    and ask the chosen lady to stand. Then, we will ask no more of her until after dessert and
    coffee are served; and then,then only, will we invite her to come to the stage, where, we
    can assure her, she will be the center of all attention! Are you ready?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Peter nodded. He was led to the bowl, and his hand was steered into its mass of cards.
    &quot;Reach deep, Peter; you don't need to choose from the top! But be sure you take only
    one card!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He reached deeply and moved his hard around through the more than a hundred cards. After
    fumbling with them for a moment, he grasped one, and slowly, carefully, brought it to the
    surface. Unable to see, he drew it from the bowl and extended his hand, grasping one card,
    toward the M. C.<br>
    <br>
    The card was taken from his hand. The M. C. looked at it carefully. He drew himself up, as
    though about to speak, the seemed confused. &quot;One moment, ladies and gentlemen-&quot;
    he hesitated, looking at the committee members seated at the front of the room. One of
    them quickly came forward. The M. C. spoke quickly to him.<br>
    <br>
    Calls went out. &quot;Who is it?&quot; someone yelled. &quot;Tell us the name&quot;
    another called.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Just one moment, ladies and gentlemen; we need to be sure we have done this
    correctly! Just one moment!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The audience couldn't hear the whispered conversation going on at the edge of the stage.
    &quot;It can't be - she wouldn't have!&quot; &quot;No, she did! but we can't let it -
    can't we find a way to draw another?&quot; &quot;Maybe we can have a runner-up!&quot;
    Clearly there was some kind of confusion. More calls were made.<br>
    <br>
    Finally the M. C. could stall no longer. &quot;We're not sure we had everything in the
    correct order. There's perhaps a need for a redraw?&quot; he was stammering, grasping for
    words.<br>
    <br>
    A woman stood up and called out, &quot;Tell us the name! We were told one chance in at
    least a hundred! Only one draw!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The flustered officials saw they had no choice.<br>
    <br>
    Nervously, the M. C. looked at the card. &quot;The name drawn,ladies and gentlemen,
    is...&quot; he drew a long breath, looking around nervously, &quot;....Sylvia
    Montfort!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    A gasp went around the room. The M. C. hastily added, &quot;we were just checking to be
    sure we had done it right - we feared there might be an irregularity. We must be sure the
    name was properly entered.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A murmur arose. 'Lady Godiva' was to be the sixty-three year old statuesque wife of one of
    the society's most senior and honored officers! The committee was looking quickly for a
    way out; this was not supposed to happen.<br>
    <br>
    Marianne stared, open mouthed, at Sylvia across the table. The others sat there, stunned.
    She seemed the most unlikely prospect. Art started to stand up to speak. His wife
    restrained him. She rose to her feet.<br>
    <br>
    Silence settled on the room as Sylvia stood. This tall, slender, well dressed older woman
    with the steel gray hair and the bearing of a queen - it was inconceivable that she was
    the chosen one for the spectacle they had set up. Sylvia beckoned for a microphone, which
    was quickly brought to her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When I put my name on that card, I did not expect to be the one drawn. I would never
    have volunteered for this! But I knew my chances, and I entered my name; now I've won - or
    lost - take your pick! But if I've lost, many of you lost, too, because a lot of you were
    hoping for someone half my age, and what you got was me! Now my husband didn't talk me
    into this, and he may be unhappy I even entered; but he has served this society a long
    time and you have honored him well. Now, it seems, it's my turn in the limelight. You
    don't need to do a redraw, or try to find a way to excuse me; because all the other women
    who entered are now off the hook, so to speak, and it's not fair to ask any of them to
    take another chance at being chosen. Like it or not, what you got is me; and I will do
    what the rules of the game require. I don't relish making a spectacle of myself, but I've
    been chosen, and I am going to do it. And if you don't look at me as you would if I were
    someone else, then I will feel insulted as well as embarrassed! Ladies and gentlemen- fair
    is fair! I'm the choice, and I will go through with it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia surrendered the microphone and sat down. Suddenly the silence was broken by a
    crescendo of applause as everyone began to realize that this woman, seemingly the most
    unlikely of prospects for this event, was really going to do what was required.<br>
    <br>
    There was little more to be said from the stage. The M. C. acknowledged Sylvia as the
    choice for &quot;Lady Godiva&quot;, and advised her to relax and enjoy her dessert and
    coffee. &quot;Then&quot;, he added, &quot;your moment will come, and we will invite you to
    come forward!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As the dessert was served, everyone at the table looked at Sylvia. &quot;You were
    great!&quot; Helga commented, &quot;but I don't see how you can do it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Nor do I&quot; responded Freida. &quot;I just couldn't. And, knowing how you felt
    about the game;&nbsp; I think you called it 'disgusting'? I can't believe you just said
    that!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You know, Sylvia&quot;, Greg added, &quot;you didn't have to do this.They were
    trying to find a way out for you. You could have just let them!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let them put another woman through it? No. I took my chance, and I was chosen. Now I
    have to live with it, and they have to live with me. Maybe they'll be sorry they didn't
    put an age limit on the entrants! I've never been an exhibitionist - but I won't be a
    coward! They don't have to find a way to get someone to take my place!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art shrugged. &quot;She has a mind of her own. The game wasn't my idea, and her
    volunteering to enter wasn't my idea either. She does her own thing!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Nervously, Sylvia finished her dessert. Marianne tried to be helpful. &quot;Want to slip
    out to the powder room before your time comes? You're going to be doing a lot of drinking
    if you have to share a drink at each table. It's going to be a long evening!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, not now. They'd think I was trying to sneak out. I'll just have to get through
    it. You're right, though - I'm going to be taking in a lot of drinks!&quot; Sylvia
    stubbornly held her seat.<br>
    <br>
    Coffee was served. After much of it had been consumed, the Master of Ceremonies again
    appeared on the stage.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen. The moment has come. I now call for our chosen lady,
    Sylvia Montfort, to come forward. Are you ready, Sylvia?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia rose at her table, and began her way to the stage. She moved steadily, but not too
    fast. She carried nothing, having left her handbag and program papers at her table. <br>
    <br>
    She was a stately figure, five feet ten inches tall, gray hair falling to shoulder length.
    She wore a dark blue dress, trimmed with a just a bit of gold, and a narrow gold belt at
    her waist. Her make-up was light, with just a touch of lipstick evident. She held her head
    high, and her bustline seemed firm, though not large. She wore a bracelet and earrings, a
    wrist watch and a small pin at her shoulder. She had barely visible eyeglasses. She seemed
    well groomed, every hair in place, her face unmarred by wrinkles or blemishes, her posture
    erect and confidant, belying the pounding heartbeat she felt as she nervously contemplated
    what she was about to do.<br>
    <br>
    Gracefully she stepped up to the stage. The M. C. offered her the center position. The
    table, which had held the bowl for the cards, was still in place, though the bowl had been
    removed. A coat tree had been positioned at the side of the stage, obviously to receive
    her clothing.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you ready?&quot; she was asked. &quot;You know what you are to do, according to
    the rules of the game?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She took the microphone. &quot;I do, indeed. You need have no fear that I shall not fully
    comply. But I must warn you - I did not come tonight prepared for this. The show I am
    going to give you is just me - all me. I was not prepared and therefore will not be
    responsible for your reaction to what you see. I know most of you would have wanted a
    younger woman for this. Well, I was younger, once; and I've not forgotten what it was
    like. But I'm not dead yet, either; so I don't know whether you are going to be shocked or
    pleasantly surprised. But I was chosen, and I'm going to play the game the way the rules
    were set up; and, as I told you, if you look at me I'm going to be terribly embarrassed,
    but if you look away, I'm going to be insulted! So - let's get started! May I have a
    chair?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The M. C. signaled, and someone brought a chair and set it beside her.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia handed back the microphone. She bent her left knee, raising her foot, and took off
    her left shoe, She placed it beside the table, the repeated with her right shoe. She
    reached to her ears, and removed each earring, in turn, placing them on the table. She
    started to take off her watch and bracelet, when the M. C. cut in.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You really can keep on your shoes and jewelry if you want, Sylvia- I don't think
    anyone would mind!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry!&quot; Sylvia retorted. &quot;I understood I was to take everything off. I'm
    not going to be accused of cheating - you're going to get me in bare feet, bare arms, bare
    ears - everything off means everything!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The M. C. retired in defeat.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia reached up under her dress, then sat on the chair. She pulled down her pantyhose,
    carefully removing them from both legs, then placing the garment on the table. Then she
    rose to her feet, and, stepping briefly to the microphone, she addressed the audience.
    &quot;I am allowed some modesty. Nothing in the rules says you get to see me in my
    underwear!&quot; She unfastened her gold belt, slipped it off and placed it on the table.<br>
    <br>
    Reaching under her skirt, she pulled down a pale blue half slip, dropping it to her bare
    feet, then stepping out of it. She stepped to the clothes tree and hung her pantyhose and
    slip.<br>
    <br>
    Returning to center stage, she reached behind her, starting to unzip her blue dress, which
    had a zipper up the back. Sliding the zipper down a few inches, she reached behind her,
    and fumbled a bit. Having achieved her aim, she then pushed a bra strap down her left arm.
    Wriggling just a bit,she managed to maneuver her arm out of the strap. She repeated the
    process with the right arm, meanwhile bending forward a bit. Finally, with both arms out
    of the straps,in a slightly bent posture, she slipped the bra out of her dress. She held
    it aloft as she carried it to the coat tree.<br>
    <br>
    She dropped her arms and stood facing her audience, offering a full front view. She again
    stepped to the microphone. &quot;I hope you're ready for this - there's just the one piece
    left! This is not easy; but I'm going to do it! Try not to laugh!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Taking a deep breath, she suddenly slipped the dress from her shoulders, dropped it, and
    stepped out of it. She laid it briefly on the table, then turned to confront her audience.<br>
    <br>
    She stood beside the table, naked. Her inside-out approach had delayed the inevitable as
    long as possible, but now she had displayed herself all at once. Her slightly tanned arms
    and face contrasted with the whiteness of her body. As she stood still and erect, her
    breasts hung on her, drooping noticeably from the high bustline which had been evident
    when she was in her dress. An erect nipple protruded noticeably from each breast. A couple
    of small moles were evident on her chest, and a small scar below her waist evidenced
    surgery of many years ago. Those near to her could see light stretch marks on her belly
    and noticeable, but not bulging, blue veins in her legs. <br>
    <br>
    The front of her abdominal area bulged just a bit below her navel. Her dark brown pubic
    hair, obviously untrimmed and not otherwise prepared for display, stuck out in a thick
    curly patch, at the bottom of which her genital area clearly showed its slit. She made no
    effort to cover herself with her hands or posture, just briefly standing there, completely
    bare.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly applause broke from one part of the room, and quickly spread. She showed no
    reaction, but just stood a few seconds, before taking her dress and carrying it to hang
    up. She did this quickly, then turned once more to the audience, and started her descent
    down the steps from the stage. Only those closest to the stage noticed that she was
    sweating slightly, even in the cool room, and actually trembling a bit as she came down
    the steps.<br>
    <br>
    She shook hands with the M. C. and then the Entertainment Committee, and proceeded to the
    first table. As she approached, she greeted those seated there. &quot;I'm supposed to
    visit with all of you, aren't I? And do I understand I'm to share a drink at each
    table?&quot; She extended her hand in greeting to those seated, as she stood at their
    table. Some took her hand nervously, others with enthusiasm. The women at the first table
    were noticeably reserved, but cordial in their greetings. The men were more animated.<br>
    <br>
    Someone produced a small wine glass, and filled it with a small amount of wine. She found
    out, as she moved about, that each table had been provided with a small glass at the
    center of the table, intended to be offered to her. The glass was offered to her by one of
    the men.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I won't be able to take much of this&quot;, Sylvia said to her table hosts,
    &quot;There are forty five tables, and if I have wine at each one I probably won't be able
    to find the last twenty!&quot; Sylvia felt the eyes of those at the table fixed upon her,
    several sets of eyes clearly staring at her breasts and genital area. She had an immediate
    urge to cover herself with her hands, something she knew would be useless as well as not
    in the spirit of the event.<br>
    <br>
    She stayed at the first table only a few minutes, just long enough to exchange greetings
    with all present and to down the proffered glass of wine.<br>
    <br>
    One of the men took out a felt-tipped pen, and informed her &quot;We're supposed to mark
    our table numbers and sign in on you, somewhere - was it on your stomach?&quot; &quot;I
    think they said stomach or backside - which do you prefer?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The man began to write on her stomach. The pen was painless and took little pressure, but
    she felt the activity, like a slight tickle, so close to her genital region, which was so
    clearly exposed just below. As he wrote, she became aware of her bladder, now receiving
    the results of the several glasses of wine and water and cups of coffee she had consumed
    at dinner. She remembered Marianne's suggestion that she avail herself of relief before
    undertaking her performance. In her mind, she contemplated the volume of liquid she was
    expected to consume, and the rule that she could not leave the room. <br>
    <br>
    As she left the first table, a male occupant of the table turned to his female companion.
    &quot;Could you imagine a woman her age doing this? I'm amazed she volunteered - but,
    really, she doesn't look all that bad, does she? Do you think she just wanted to show
    off?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You were looking at the wrong places, Fred,&quot; the lady answered him. &quot;Show
    off? Did you see how pale she was? That lady was perspiring and actually shaking! She was
    so nervous she could hardly stand there! And as for looking bad, well, are you going to
    look at me when I'm her age?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, the evening's program went on. Several ceremonial events were scheduled, along
    with some theatrical performances, and Sylvia was no longer the center of attention.
    Perhaps, she realized, not the center, but certainly a very visible and attention-getting
    side show. Eyes were upon her from all over, and at each table she visited she would
    definitely be the prime object of interest. For the performances on stage,the house lights
    were dimmed, and a spotlight used to illuminate the performers.<br>
    <br>
    Back at the table she had left, Marianne turned to Art. &quot;How do you feel? I don't see
    how a man could let his wife do this - and, of all of us here, I would have thought she
    was the one who absolutely would never do it! But look at her - she looks so calm and
    collected!&quot;&nbsp; Art waited a moment, thoughtfully, then replied. &quot;I've lived
    with her a long time. She ran her own business for many years. She's made her own
    decisions. She wasn't pleased with this game - you know she called it 'disgusting' ! But
    she wanted to be a good sport about it, and no one's going to talk her out of it! She's
    going to do exactly what she thinks the game requires, even if she thinks it's in terrible
    taste. I don't control her - and woe to the man who tries to!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helga nodded. &quot;I wish I could be like her. I didn't really think she would do it. But
    look at her - making a point of taking off even her jewelry!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As the act on the stage ended, the spotlight moved from the stage about the room. Suddenly
    it shone directly on Sylvia. <br>
    <br>
    In the glare of the spotlight her white skin stood out brilliantly, and the attention of
    everyone in the room was directed at her. Sylvia felt not only naked, which she surely
    was, but exposed as she had never been before, somehow teribly vulnerable. She glanced
    about the room, her body shaking slightly, her hanging breasts quivering visibly. <br>
    <br>
    The exposure lasted only a minute or to, after which the spotlight returned to the stage
    for the next event.<br>
    <br>
    By the time Sylvia reached her fourth table, she decided to decline further offers of
    wine, and insist on water, or at least something nonalcoholic for her obligatory drink at
    each table. She was already feeling the effects of the wine, and she felt a bit more sure
    of herself exchanging toasts when water was in her glass. To be sure, the small glasses
    provided for her typically held only two or three ounces; but Sylvia's still sharp mind
    could calculate the cumulative effect of forty five such portions, which would come to
    over a gallon of liquid. By avoiding the wine, she thought she could avoid getting
    obviously drunk, but she was nervously contemplating how she could possibly hold a gallon
    of liquid in her body, in addition to the quantity she had already consumed at dinner.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia kept up her pace, moving to new tables. Now her stomach bore a collection of
    inscriptions done by writers at the points she had visited. No longer was she shaking,
    though only those closest to her had observed it earlier. She tried to act with dignity,
    speaking directly to those at the tables she approached. At each stop, she was careful to
    turn herself around completely, assuring those present of a close-up view of her body from
    all sides. In bare feet, she seemed a bit shorter than when she had ascended the stage,
    and in some respects she seemed more vulnerable than majestic. She tried to keep up a
    smile, though it was becoming more difficult as her internal discomfort grew with each new
    glass of liquid. Yet she continued to accept the glasses at each table, always emptying
    the glass, though often insisting on something other than wine. To the people at the
    tables she visited, she said nothing of the discomfort caused by her distended bladder,
    now well beyond the point at which she would liked to have emptied it.<br>
    <br>
    She approached the fifth table, occupied by seven men and three women. A man had already
    prepared a glass of wine for her, and extended it to her as she approached. &quot;No,
    please - I don't think I can handle the wine, thanks! Could it just be water or something
    else?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The man emptied the wine into his own glass, then refilled the wine glass from an ice
    water pitcher. He extended it to her. &quot;Welcome to our table! I must say, you put on a
    great show! Won't you sit down for a moment?&quot; He made a gesture of rising, to offer
    her his chair. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, thank you,&quot; Sylvia replied, her nervousness still showing in her voice.
    &quot;The rules say I'm supposed to show myself off to you - whether or not you want to
    look! And I've had more than enough wine - I have to be able to keep my composure through
    the rest of the evening!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She sipped the water. One of the women spoke up. &quot;I don't see how you can drink so
    much - I'd have been running for the ladies' long ago! Anyway, tell us, why did you offer
    your name? Everyone was so surprised when you were chosen!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia finished the water. &quot;I didn't like this game; I thought the idea was terrible!
    But it was done with the<br>
    intent of just being fun. It would have spoiled the evening if enough women didn't
    volunteer! So I did - and, well, all of you lost - you got me!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I wouldn't exactly say we lost,&quot; another man replied. &quot;you were very good
    about it; and, if I might say so, you look rather, well- &quot; he hesitated, groping for
    the right words. &quot;Attractive! Isn't that what you mean?&quot; another man chimed in.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I think he was starting to say old!&quot; Sylvia answered. &quot;But I don't feel
    that old!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How do you feel?&quot; a lady inquired of her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I would love a trip to the ladies room, like one of you said! All of this wine and
    water! But otherwise; oh, I am really just feeling so exposed! I could never have even
    imagined doing this! Never, never, did I do anything like this!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you getting used to it?&quot; a woman asked. &quot;Would you?&quot; Sylvia
    answered, with raised eyebrows. &quot;No, I'm not,&quot; she answered her own question.
    &quot;And if my husband is unhappy with me doing this, I'll remind him he was Vice
    President when the Entertainment Committee thought this up, and it would have looked awful
    if his own wife wouldn't participate!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A man picked up the felt pen, to inscribe a notation on her body. &quot;Where do we sign
    in?&quot; he asked her with a smile. &quot;Looks like everyone's been writing on your
    stomach; here, I'll use the space just down a little!&quot; He started to write below her
    navel, just above her pubic hair.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you write there, please don't press hard&quot;, Sylvia cautioned. &quot;You can
    write, but I'm getting really sensitive down there!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's where all the drinks have gone!&quot; another male commented, to his female
    companion.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She's going to have to hold a lot more!&quot; the lady observed.<br>
    <br>
    As Sylvia moved to the next table, those she had just left followed her with their eyes.
    &quot;Do you really think she looks old?&quot; one man asked of another. &quot;She's no
    young chick, for sure! Look at how her bustline's drooping- she can't hold those things
    up! But all in all, she's not bad - she's all female!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Without a doubt! No doubt at all - you can see the evidence - all the
    evidence!&quot; a woman observed.<br>
    <br>
    Another woman, older, possibly even Sylvia's age, was not impressed. &quot;It's awful!
    Absolutely disgusting! I can't see how she could have offered herself for this. No decent
    woman could do this!&quot; She wriggled her nose in obvious distaste.<br>
    <br>
    By the time Sylvia reached her tenth table, her smile had faded. She was bravely trying to
    show herself as the rules required, but the discomfort of her overdistended bladder had
    now turned to real pain. Her condition was noticeable to those she approached. To make
    matters worse, at that very moment the group on stage completed their activity, and the
    spotlight flitted about the room for a moment, then focusing again on Sylvia. Somehow, she
    felt everyone in the room was aware of her intense discomfort and somehow enjoying it.<br>
    <br>
    A woman addressed her &quot;Mrs. Montfort, I don't see how you can go through this. All
    that stuff you've been drinking - don't you need a bathroom stop?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The rules say I cannot leave the room,&quot; Sylvia replied, with obvious distress.
    &quot;I need a bathroom stop! it<br>
    probably shows! No, it really hurts!&quot; her voice trailed off.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can't leave the room?&quot; a man asked of her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's right!&quot; Sylvia replied. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;But they didn't say you couldn't have some relief if you stayed in the room, now did
    they?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't tease me,&quot; Sylvia responded, &quot;It hurts something awful! I don't know
    how to get through this!&quot; The distress and discomfort was showing.<br>
    <br>
    The man was holding a large plastic cup which had held a soft drink. &quot;I brought this
    in - it's empty, now. I'd let you fill it, if you want to, right here! It's big enough to
    help you at least a little, and I could empty it outside. It's white so no one would know
    what's in it!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia looked at him at first with apprehension, then disdain. &quot;Thank you, sir, but I
    don't think I could do<br>
    something like that!&quot; Her attitude was cool and a bit formal. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry, I meant no harm. Just wanted to help!&quot; he commented as she moved away.<br>
    <br>
    The lady seated next to the man who had offered the cup turned to him &quot;How could you
    offer her something like that? You didn't expect her to accept that offer, did you? That
    was an awful thing to say! She's embarrassed enough at what she's having to do!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I just thought she might welcome a chance for relief! I don't see how she can keep
    going!&quot; he shrugged.<br>
    <br>
    She got through the next two tables with a minimum of conversation. It was evident that
    she was suffering<br>
    considerable physical distress. She drank the obligatory drinks with formality, received
    the markings on her body, and moved on.<br>
    <br>
    At the fourteenth table, Sylvia tried to keep up her composure, but she was rapidly losing
    it. Her mind was on her bladder, visibly swollen. As people wrote on her stomach, several
    had commented on the swelling or the hardness they could feel. The pain was getting to be
    intense, and she wondered how long she could restrain her need to urinate. Her internal
    torment was getting unbearable.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly she shifted direction. Instead of going to the next table in order, she retreated
    down the route she had come, her eyes searching out for someone she had passed earlier. A
    number of people spoke to her, but she ignored most of them.<br>
    <br>
    Finally she found what she was looking for. She was back at the table where the man was
    sitting with the plastic cup. She stood beside him, greeting the others briefly, then
    turned to him. &quot;You offered me the chance to - to use that cup, if I'd do it
    here?&quot; she asked, in a rather low voice.<br>
    <br>
    Every eye at the table now focused on her. &quot;Yes, I did, but it didn't seem like a
    good idea. No one else here thought I should have done it. I'm sorry - I didn't mean to
    annoy you!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Is the offer still available?&quot; she asked, averting the eyes of the others.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you want to, but I'm really sorry, I don't think it was a good idea!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right now, it's the best idea that's come to me - really, I've got to do something -
    I'm sorry, too!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She hardly knew how to continue.<br>
    <br>
    He held out the cup. &quot;Would you hold it in place - under me? And tell me when it's
    getting full, because I could probably fill it several times! Please?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She felt her face flush, as those at the table stared. The man, flustered, held the cup
    under her as she spread her legs slightly. &quot;Please watch! I may be messy! I haven't
    done it like this before!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A number of people around were staring, now, aware of what was about to happen. The man
    held the cup just under her genitals, with a gap of only an inch or so. She looked
    straight ahead, avoiding the eyes of all those staring at her. She tried to relax.<br>
    <br>
    After a bit a stream began to pour into the cup. People stretched their necks, trying to
    see the action. The man holding the cup kept it steady, trying to see the filling
    contents. After a few seconds he told her, rather loudly, &quot;It's getting full - can
    you stop?&quot; She tried. <br>
    <br>
    It was difficult, even harder to stop the stream than to restrain her bladder earlier. She
    managed, however, and stopped before the cup was full - barely. She had let out perhaps a
    pint; nowhere near all that she contained, but enough to afford her a lessening of the
    pain. <br>
    <br>
    Minimizing her eye contact, she said quietly to the man who had offered the cup,
    &quot;Thank you!I don't know how I could go on without something like that! I hate to
    leave you with that, though!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    He held the cup, filled with her warm urine, a bit foamy. &quot;Never mind! I'll take it
    out and empty it. Glad I could help you. Come back if you need to!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've got to go on,&quot; she said, to no one in particular.<br>
    <br>
    Relieved somewhat, she returned to her table visits. The entertainment program went on, as
    a folkloric group present a dancing and music exhibition. Still, many eyes focused on
    Sylvia wherever she moved. She knew that whatever was on stage, she remained a major
    attraction, and, every time the stage event halted, even for a few seconds, the spotlight
    was inevitably trained on her.<br>
    <br>
    Her stomach was filled up with writing, and now people were writing the table numbers and
    signatures on other places. Her buttocks were beginning to accumulate some inscriptions,
    and at least one man had pointedly chosen to write his table's inscription on her breast,
    holding it gently while the writing was done. Sylvia had thought of objecting to this
    liberty being taken, but decided not to make an issue of it. At the table following, she
    motioned to the other breast when the pen was produced, suggesting &quot;Maybe I need some
    balance - why don't you put it here?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    At the table where she had eaten, her spouse and the other guests watchfully monitored her
    progress. Several had noticed the incident with the cup. After it, Helga had observed,
    &quot;I don't see how she could do that! In front of everyone!&quot; She shook her hook in
    amazement.<br>
    <br>
    Freida was at least sympathetic. &quot;After you drink so much, you're going to be so
    uncomfortable - well, you have to do something!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Hans observed, &quot;I think most women would just have headed for a toilet&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not Sylvia!&quot; Marianne responded. &quot;That lady's not going to give up - she's
    determined to do everything the game requires! But I know I couldn't have done it&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art shook his head, just a bit. &quot;That's my wife,&quot; he said with resignation.<br>
    <br>
    After a number of additional table visits, Sylvia was observed to again depart from her
    route. Her eyes searched for the table of the man who had offered her the cup. Slowly, by
    a circuitous route, she moved toward the place where he had sat.<br>
    <br>
    He saw her coming. There was eye contact. As if to offer aid, he held up, just slightly,
    the cup she had used before, now emptied. He nodded to her. She approached him.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't know who you are, but no one else has offered to help me - would you do it
    again? I need it desperately! I'm so full, and it hurts so bad!&quot; her voice was low,
    but shaking, and her distress was visible and real. The ritual of the cup was repeated,
    this time with many more watchers.<br>
    <br>
    As the cup was about a third full, applause broke among the audience for the on stage
    performer. As he departed the stage, the spitlight was turned directly on Sylvia, standing
    and urinating into the cup. It took a moment for even those nearby to grasp what they were
    watching. A gasp went up from several, mild applause from a few others. The humiliation of
    it struck her; her muscles froze. Her stream stopped, her bladder still painfully full.<br>
    <br>
    The man started to remove the cup. &quot;Don't!&quot; she protested, &quot;I'm not
    finished - please hold it!&quot; The cup was returned, the holder now clearly illuminated
    in the spotlight. She finished filling the cup.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you! I may be back!&quot; she said, in parting, as he rose with the full cup,
    preparing to leave the room. Only at this point did the spotlight leave her.<br>
    <br>
    A woman seated near the man stared at him. &quot;How could you do that - right at our
    table! With that spotlight on us! This was an awful spectacle without everyone seeing that
    here! I can't take any more. I'm leaving!&quot; Fury was in her voice, as she and the man
    accompanying her arose and left the room. Others at the table followed suit,including,
    finally, the man who had come to Sylvia's aid.<br>
    <br>
    Sylivia continued her required circulation.<br>
    <br>
    She approached her own table. Art looked at her, &quot;How are you holding up?&quot; he
    asked her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;All right at the moment, but it's been rough. &quot;Here, you can write on me -
    everyone has been doing it!&quot; She presented her body. The guests looked at each other,
    wondering who should do the writing. They were looking at Art. &quot;One of you do it -
    not me!&quot; he requested.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you ashamed of me?&quot; Sylvia asked, plaintively.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never!&quot; Art exclaimed, breaking into a smile. He took the pen, and started to
    write on his wife's stomach. He commented &quot;Hard to find a place! look's like you're
    getting used up!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She pointed to her breast, bearing only one inscription on each. &quot;Here - might as
    well be you as someone else!&quot; He accepted the invitation, and complied.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We saw the guy with the cup! I don't see how you did that!&quot; Helga observed,
    half in admiration, half in disgust. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; Sylvia replied, after a moment's hesitation, &quot;Let's say, a lady has
    to do what a lady has to do. I didn't think I could do it either, but the pain was killing
    me. I had to do something!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art just nodded. She accepted her required drink from them, then moved on.<br>
    <br>
    After she had left, Art excused himself briefly. He located one of the hotel's serving
    staff. Explaining his identity, he offered his room key. &quot;My wife's clothes and
    belongings are on stage, behind the edge of the curtain. I want you to collect her things
    and take them to our room. Bring me back the key!&quot; He accompanied the man to the
    stage stairs, where he explained to the committee chairman the errand.<br>
    <br>
    A few minutes later, after Art returned to the table, the man appeared, bearing the room
    key. The errand was completed, he reported. Art acknowledged the service with a suitable
    gratuity.<br>
    <br>
    Meanwhile, oblivious to her husband's activity, Sylvia continued. Twenty minutes or so
    after leaving his table, her bladder was again very full, the result of her continued
    liquid intake. This time she sought relief before the situation became painful, as she
    knew it would. She ceased to move along the obvious route, and headed back to the table of
    the one who had twice assisted her with relief. Eyes all around the room followed her
    movements, anticipating her intention.<br>
    <br>
    She reach the table where she had received the blessed relief before. No one was there;
    the table was empty. She glanced about quickly for a sign of the cup, or the man who had
    offered it. It was obvious he had departed, the cup accompanying him, perhaps to become a
    treasured souvenir.<br>
    <br>
    Relief had obviously eluded her. She began to wonder if she could make it through the
    remainder of the evening. The tension in her pelvic area was increasing as her bladder
    continued to distend. She would have to get by without any way to relieve herself.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia returned to her route and continued her movement. She reached the last table just
    as the final act came on stage. She finished her duties in short order, downing the last
    drink required of her - this time she accepted the wine. After collecting the signature,
    she moved to the table with the Committee Chairman. She approached him.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've run out of tables&quot;, she reported. &quot;And every one in the room has
    stared at me! Is there anything left?&quot; Her voice was impatient, reflecting her
    internal distress. She quickly got her response, as two committee members rose and
    approached her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to check the signatures and table numbers - did everyone sign in?&quot; The
    first committee man smiled at her,looking at thge writing scrawled all over her body.
    &quot;Looks like everyone did!&quot; commented the second, viewing the accumulation of
    writing. &quot;But we have to check!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They began going over her body, one calling out the tables which were recorded on her
    skin, as the second marked them off on a list. It was a laborious process, taking several
    minutes, and drawing the attention of all around. As the man looking her over read off the
    inscriptions, he reviewed her stomach carefully, then worked up her body. At one point he
    realized that some of the writing was obscured by her drooping breasts. Embarassed
    himself, he hesitatingly asked her, &quot;Mrs. Montfort, I can't read some of the writing
    here - could you raise, er, lift your ---?&quot; Words failed him, as he could not think
    of a discreet word for her breasts. Sylvia understood, however, and raised her breasts
    with her hands, as he inspected the area under them. The review done, she lowered them. <br>
    <br>
    After a few minutes, the officials conferred. &quot;Mrs. Montfort, I think we can confirm
    that you have been recorded at all tables. I think you can return to your own seat until
    the closing event, which should be in just a few minutes!&quot; Gratefully, she retired to
    her own table, where Art and the others awaited her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Is Lady Godiva allowed to return here? I think I've made it through all the
    tables!&quot; Sylvia greeted them. Her expression and nervous demeanor belied her physical
    distress as well as her lost modesty.<br>
    <br>
    She received congratulations from her table mates, but cut them short. &quot;All I'm
    waiting for is the end of this thing - so I can get my clothes on and head for the Ladies'
    - all those drinks - you can't imagine how I need to go!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You had that cup a couple of times!&quot; Marianne interjected.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I could have it used it again and again - I never was able to empty myself - come
    on, let's get this over!&quot; The urgency in her voice was apparent. She wasn't
    interested in further conversation. After a couple of minutes, she stood, in obvious
    discomfort, and began to nervously pace about at the side of the room.<br>
    <br>
    As the last act moved from the stage, the Master of Ceremonies took his place to announce
    the end of the<br>
    festivities and close the evening. After a thank you to the performers, the Entertainment
    Committee and some others, he then issued a call. &quot;Sylvia Montfort - Our Lady Godiva!
    Please come to the stage!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia, now standing at the side of the room, struggling to last through the last minutes
    of her ordeal, came rapidly forward. Unlike her earlier feigned nonchalance, she now held
    her body tightly with both hands; her right positioned just under her breasts, obviously
    to minimize the motion of those parts as she almost ran to the stage; her left tightly
    pressed to her pubic area. Some might have thought she was trying to preserve her modesty,
    though Sylvia herself had abandoned any hope of that. She only hoped she could keep her
    painful bladder from leaking through the last few moments.<br>
    <br>
    She stepped up to the stage. As she moved to the center, her eyes searched for the clothes
    tree on which her dress and underwear had been hung. It was nowhere to be seen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sylvia,&quot; the M. C. addressed her, &quot;We never expected you to volunteer for
    this game, and, if you did, we never thought you would be chosen. We've known your husband
    for years, but until now we haven't seen much of you. Tonight we made up for that!&quot;
    Laughter erupted from the audience as they contemplated the double meaning.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sylvia Montfort, you did everything the game required, and I think we all share in
    this - you were magnificent!&quot; He motioned with his hand to the naked woman standing
    beside him, as a round of applause broke out, turning into a standing ovation.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia accepted the applause, trying to smile as she endured yet another pang of pain from
    her swollen abdomen. Her hand pressed to the source of the discomfort, not unnoticed by
    those watching.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sylvia, I know this has not been easy for you; and, even now we can see how
    uncomfortable you are. You were great, and since you did everything the rules require, it
    is my privilege to present to you the prize money - you earned it well!&quot; He held out
    to her an envelope holding the prize award.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Anything you 'd like to say?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia grasped the microphone, still holding her other hand pressed to her pubic area
    while she held her legs pressed together.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I thank you; it was never my idea to do this when I came here tonight; but you chose
    me in the drawing, and I have tried to do what was expected. But - I could have done with
    about forty less drinks! All I want now is my clothes, and will everyone please clear a
    path for me to the ladies' room?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A loud round of laughter and applause arose. &quot;Sylvia&quot;, the M. C. continued.
    &quot;your distinguished spouse arranged to have your clothes, jewelry, and other things
    taken to your room upstairs. And now, with our thanks and appreciation for you both, I'm
    calling for him to come forward and escort you there himself!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia looked dumfounded. &quot;He's going to take me out of here naked?&quot; she asked,
    shocked.<br>
    <br>
    Art rushed forward, taking off his coat as he came. He strode up the steps, and placed the
    coat over his wife's bare shoulders. The M. C. shook hands with each of them, as Sylvia,
    dressed only in her husband's jacket, a bewildered expression on her face and one hand
    still trying to hold her bottom, joined him and walked toward the door.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Art - what is this? I can't go out there; not into the lobby? My whole bottom is
    bare!&quot; she complained to him as she half walked, half ran, to the exit.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Looks like you're covering the important part with your hand! Come on - it'll only
    be a few seconds! By the way, you were absolutely magnificent! I've got the best looking
    wife in the room!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You mean the most looked at! Absolutely everyone has seen every inch of me! Now
    look, you've got to let me stop at the ladies! Oh, I never had to go so bad in my
    life!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not a chance! The only stop you're making is our room!&nbsp; And, incidentally, I
    think I've got the sexiest wife in the group, too! I'm not letting this go without the
    right way to end it!&quot; He ushered her through the crowd, out the main door, and
    quickly to a lift someone was holding open for them.<br>
    <br>
    The door closed. They shared the lift with several others from the banquet. Sylvia was
    showered with praise for her performance from the other occupants. She nodded politely,
    not relaxing her grip on her pubic region.<br>
    <br>
    They got out at their floor, and Art quickly led her to their room. He fumbled just a bit
    with the key. &quot;Hurry! Or I'm going to water the floor! I never had to hold so much or
    so long! Hurry!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He got the door open. As they entered, he removed the jacket from her shoulders. He took
    his naked wife by the hand and turned her to face him. &quot;You were absolutely the
    greatest!&quot; he told her, as he kissed her with enthusiasm. She tried to push him away,
    but gently. &quot;I've got to get some relief! Quickly!&quot; she tried to tell him.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Just a moment&quot;, he pleaded. &quot;You've been parading around naked in front of
    four hundred people! Don't I get a good look at you, too?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look quick!&quot; she replied, turning full front to him, a hand still holding her
    pubic area. &quot;And, whose idea was it, anyway? You didn't warn me about this! I wasn't
    ready- look at me! I didn't trim my hair down there, I didn't pick clothes to take off
    easily! I would never have done this if your committee hadn't thought up this idea of a
    game! Why couldn't you have told me?&quot; Her voice reflected not only her physical
    anguish, but more than a touch of anger.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It wasn't my idea, either! The committee came up with it on their own! I never
    thought you would have volunteered for it! But - you did look great!&quot; His voice
    stopped as he moved toward her.<br>
    <br>
    His hands went to her breasts, holding her by the nipples. He kissed her. She protested.
    &quot;Later! I've got to pee! Oh, my bladder hurts so bad! I told you - I've got to get
    some relief!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let's both get some&quot; he replied, releasing his grip on one breast only to
    enable him to unfasten his own clothing. She found her other breast held in his lips.
    Still she pressed her hand on her vulva, trying to keep her bladder from emptying.
    &quot;Let me go&quot; she protested, just a bit more feebly, &quot;You don't know how full
    my bladder is!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Art replied. &quot;Mine is, too. I haven't been since dinner,
    either. But right now there's a more important need!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Your bladder isn't holding forty glasses worth!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yours isn't either! I saw you urinate into those cups!&nbsp; That was the sexiest
    thing I saw you do! How could you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When your bladder's swollen to twice its size, you can let it out anywhere you can!
    Look - I'm a lot fuller than you are! It hurts - worse than it's ever hurt!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    At this point they were both naked. He put her hand on his abdomen, saying &quot;Feel me.
    Don't I feel full?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    His hand found her pubic area. He palpated her swollen, hardened bladder. &quot;You
    know,&quot; he commented, &quot;You've got the sexiest bladder I've ever felt!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How many have you felt?&quot; she responded. Her hand slipped just a bit and touched
    his firm, erect penis. She gripped it just slightly.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly she let go her grasp, and ran into the bathroom.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, it's never been this bad!&quot; she complained, heading for the toilet. She
    seated herself, moaning softly, her eyes closed. She tried to relax her sphincters. She
    tried to no avail. Nothing happened. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh&quot;, she groaned again, moving her legs apart, again trying to relax her
    muscles. Another light moan escaped her lips, but her bladder refused to empty, despite
    its obvious bulge.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can't let it out!&quot; she groaned, in some desperation. &quot;Art, try to help
    me! Try to massage me a bit - maybe it'll help me let go &quot;<br>
    <br>
    Art came to her. He pressed on her bladder, just below her navel. She made a pained
    expression, but there were no results. He slipped his hand down, to her genital area, and
    fondled her there just a bit. Her pained expression eased just a bit. &quot;A little
    more&quot;, she asked slowly. <br>
    <br>
    His hand moved around in her genital area. He toyed with her hair, then slipped a finger
    inside her. His other hand seized a nipple. She gasped slightly. &quot;Not yet! I need to
    pee so badly - aren't you going to let me? My bladder was never this full before!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She felt his hand pull her nipple, as another moved in her genitals. He began to nudge her
    from her seat. &quot;Aren't you going to let me?&quot; she asked, now rather weakly,
    &quot;my bladder's so full, and it's so hard! - or are you wanting to feel it from the
    inside?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    For an answer, he applied his hand to her breasts in silence. She sensed her own arousal.
    &quot;It doesn't hurt quite as bad as it did - but I couldn't take any pressure on
    it!&quot; Her protests were diminishing.<br>
    <br>
    He quickly moved her from the toilet,. He dropped a bath towel on the floor, falling onto
    it, then pulling her on top of him. &quot;Oh, but it hurts!&quot; she protested again, as
    she was drawn into position straddling him. Suddenly she felt his organ enter her, somehow
    passing through her vaginal opening with its tightly clenched muscles. There was just a
    bit of motion. Then he stopped.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Does it really hurt?&quot; he asked her. She nodded, then moved up and down a bit.
    Then a bit more. Suddenly she, too,stopped. &quot;It feels so strange...&quot; she said.
    He began movement, slowly, then increasing. She felt the feeling change from pain to a
    kind of strange fullness. She somehow didn't want it to end. She held her muscles clamped
    tight.<br>
    <br>
    He seized her erect nipples, pulling them wide apart and stretching her breasts. Her whole
    body seemed wracked with tension; her genital muscles tightly clenched to restrain herself
    from urinating, her pelvic region distended with her overfilled bladder, her nipples and
    breasts pulled and stretched. Her arms tried to grasp Art's, to ease the tension on her
    breasts, but then she dropped them as the strains throughout her body rose. Her mouth
    opened as if to cry, but emitted no sound. Suddenly she felt her body seem to explode as
    though an electric flash had passed through her nerves; she tensed, then felt her muscles
    gradually loose the tension as she felt him explode in a second crescendo of energy. <br>
    <br>
    They collapsed slowly to the hard floor. Suddenly she again became aware of the pain
    caused by her swollen bladder. She tried to release it, but her body still wouldn't
    cooperate. She spoke to her spouse, all but unconscious under her. &quot;I've got to pee!
    And it won't come out!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She lay for a moment, then scrambled off of him. She half knelt, half squatted in the
    nearby shower stall. She was still trying to release her bladder, to no effect. &quot;Help
    me, Art! It won't come out! Oh, there's so much in there!&quot; He moved to her, still
    drained from his own release. He put his hand on her abdomen, feeling its hardness.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Push on it!&quot; she demanded, as she spread her legs a bit. He pressed, gently.
    Her distress was very real, as the pain within her intensified. Art looked at her,
    watching for some sign of results. After a bit, there was a trickle from her. She said
    nothing, just held her legs widely apart and assumed a squatting position. The trickle
    became a stream, and then the stream grew in strength.<br>
    <br>
    She raised herself slowly to a standing position in the shower stall, her spouse in front
    of her. His hands slipped up from pressing on her bladder to gripping her breasts. She
    tilted her head back, tossing her gray hair behind her, relishing the relief as her
    bladder forcefully emptied. Her hand moved forward a bit, touching his stomach. He looked
    down at the stream of almost clear liquid pouring forcefully from her, the results of all
    those drinks she had consumed through the evening. Her hand found his largely flaccid
    penis, and pointed it at her own streaming genital area. &quot;Don't you need some relief,
    too?&quot; she asked suggestively, while holding his organ.<br>
    <br>
    He tried to relax, trying to allow&nbsp; his own urine stream to release. Sylvia looked
    down, observing his penis, gently gripped in her hand. Her own stream continued to pour
    out of her. Though he would have scarcely thought it possible, his erection returned
    rapidly as he watched her urination pour down over the legs of them both. Despite his own
    need, his erection prevented his urination. &quot;Can't you let go?&quot; Sylvia asked,
    &quot;I know you need to!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He tried to release; but now it was he who couldn't let go. He shook his head to answer
    her question. &quot;I can't let go! It just doesn't work! I'm too---&quot; he fumbled for
    the right word.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Worked up?&quot; she said, looking down at his erect organ, as her own urination
    finally came to and end. &quot;You poor guy! What can we do about that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Almost without thinking, he was squeezing and spreading her breasts. Her eyes opened and
    she smiled at him, the pain of her bladder now ended. &quot;You couldn't have done that
    twenty years ago - they wouldn't have stretched that far!&quot; she said to him slowly, as
    her hand tightened around his erect member. <br>
    <br>
    Her urine stream ended, Sylvia reached for the shower faucet. &quot;We're a mess!&quot;
    she observed, turning on the warm water, which cascaded on them both. He continued to hold
    her breasts, and she his erect penis. In a few seconds she turned the water off, and
    reached for a towel. She quickly wiped herself off, then toweled down her husband, as they
    momentarily released their grips on each other. Grasping him by his erect penis, she led
    him from the bathroom to the bed, where she fell on her back, her legs spread slightly,
    his member still in her grasp. &quot;There must have been four hundred people who got to
    see me this way&quot;, she observed, &quot;and I was wondering if looking at me can still
    do things for you. Guess I got my answer!&quot; Her hand again again grasped his erect
    penis.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You're holding the evidence&quot; was all he could think to say, looking at his nude
    wife spread across the bed, her hand still grasping him.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I think it's time to fix this!&quot; she said, indicating with a tug what she meant,
    &quot;We need to get you some bladder relief!&quot; He got the hint.<br>
    <br>
    A few minutes later, both of them felt drained of energy. <br>
    <br>
    Two such experiences in succession was more than they'd had in many years. Sylvia watched,
    lying naked on her back on the bed, as her spouse rose. &quot;Going to get that relief,
    now?&quot; she asked, a bit weakly. He nodded, rising to move to the bathroom.<br>
    <br>
    Mustering all of her remaining energy, Sylvia struggled to follow him. &quot;You watched
    me - something you haven't done in a long time! Now it's my turn!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She steered him into the shower. Her hand took his penis. &quot;I'll take care of this -
    you need your hands for other things!&quot; she instructed him. His hand rose to grasp her
    nipple.<br>
    <br>
    He was now relaxed. Even with her hand on his organ, it was flaccid. Slowly his urine
    stream began, directed by her to the shower wall. She moved him around a bit, just playing
    with the stream. It took him a long time to empty himself. Her hand did not release its
    gentle grip. When the stream ended, she tugged him back to the bed. Extinguishing the
    light, they fell unclad to the sheets, both of them exhausted, and soon fast asleep.<br>
    <br>
    The sunlight woke her up, coming through the slight opening in the drawn curtains. She lay
    there a moment, considering the intensity of the light, suggesting that it was no longer
    early. She quickly became aware of an urgent feeling in her bladder, demanding to be
    emptied of the residue of last night's liquid intake. She looked about her. The sheet had
    almost completely slipped off both of them, and they lay side by side, she on her back, he
    somewhat on his side, both of them naked. She looked at her sleeping husband for a few
    seconds, then sat up on the side of the bed. With a hand she reached and pulled open the
    curtains, allowing the sunlight to pour into their room and over their bed, which the
    window overlooked.<br>
    <br>
    She stood up and peered out the window. It was brilliant sunlight. Another wing of the
    hotel extended at right angles to their own, and the windows of the rooms could be easily
    seen. As she looked out, she considered that anyone in those rooms could also look into
    her own room. She wondered if anyone was looking, as she stood in front of window, nude.
    Yesterday, she reflected, she could not have done this. Her modesty would have recoiled at
    the thought of having a curtain open when either of them were undressed, let alone
    standing naked in front of an unshaded window. She smiled to herself. Last night over four
    hundred people had seen her naked, most of them close up. What would a few more matter?<br>
    <br>
    As she looked, she saw a man in a room of the other wing come to the window. He stopped
    and stared. Sylvia didn't move from her spot. She didn't return the stare, but she made no
    move to cover her nudity. After a minute or so, she turned and looked at her sleeping
    spouse, whose naked form could also have been seen through the window.<br>
    <br>
    She felt a bit messy. Her hair was uncombed and tousled. Across her stomach, her abdomen,
    and even on parts of her breasts and buttocks were the remains of inked inscriptions from
    last night's table visits. Now they were smudged, largely unreadable. She looked at the
    sheet on which she had lain; smudges of ink were evident there, too. She hadn't had a real
    shower since the afternoon of the previous day. Quite a change, she reflected, from her
    usual tidy, almost immaculate appearance. Normally she slept in a nightgown; now, she
    considered that there hadn't been a stitch of clothing on her body since last night's
    dinner event. She smiled and shrugged. She squeezed her legs together, trying to force
    further martyrdom on her distended bladder. It was beginning to hurt. She started to rise
    from the bed to go to relieve herself. She glanced out the window. Her male viewer was
    still in place, apparently still looking in her direction.<br>
    <br>
    She looked back at her naked and sleeping spouse, who had now rolled mostly on his back.
    She reached toward him, wondering whether to press on his abdominal area to test the
    hardness of his bladder. No, she decided; that might wake him. She had another
    inspiration. She wondered to what extent he might have recovered from last night's<br>
    lovemaking.<br>
    <br>
    She moved closer to Art, wondering if the man across the way was still watching. She bent
    over him, then allowed a hanging breast to brush his face. She repeated, with the other
    breast. His eyes flickered. He stirred just a bit. Her hand reached down, pinching the tip
    of his penis. She pinched again, the breast again brushing his face.<br>
    <br>
    His eyes opened. &quot;It's morning&quot;, she said cheerily, his penis feeling her pinch
    and responding with a bit of<br>
    hardening.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked. He glanced at the window. &quot;Hey - the
    curtains are open - and it's daylight!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes&quot;, she answered. &quot;And there's a guy looking at us through the window
    from the other wing!&quot; Her pinch was repeated, as his organ became firm.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And you're letting him? With the window open - the curtains open - and all?&quot; he
    could hardly believe his gray haired wife.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hundreds of people looked at me last night. Are you worried about one more? Or don't
    you want him to see you?&quot; she replied. As she spoke, she moved herself atop him,
    sitting astride his thighs.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked her, then quickly added. &quot;I gotta pee!
    Please!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Like I had to last night?&quot; She was almost laughing. Her hand found his abdomen,
    just below his navel, and pressed gently. The hardness beneath was evident.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Guess you do!&quot; she commented, then added, &quot;Later! Just now you have
    something else to do!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He had winced beneath her pressing hand. Now he was wide awake. His erection was firm, and
    she introduced it into herself, as she leaned forward.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I really have to go, Sylvia - I need to..&quot; She just smiled at him. &quot;Just
    now, no. Like you told me last night. And, if it's any consolation, I need to go,
    too!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Is the guy looking?&quot; Art asked, changing the topic.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Probably. Do you want me to stop what I'm doing and go look?&quot; she asked. She
    was moving slowly, atop him.<br>
    <br>
    He glanced at window, but his field of vision couldn't pick up the opposing window where
    the supposed viewer was. Suddenly he winced noticeably as her weight bounced on his
    bladder.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sylvia - really, I need to pee!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She just smiled, her pace picking up. &quot;You have to earn that privilege. How about
    some cooperation?&quot; He started to move slightly within her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What have you got hands for?&quot; she teased him, &quot;I've got no bra to hold me
    up! These things need support&quot;, she commented, shaking her bosom slightly. His hands
    grasped her breasts, slipping to the nipples, which he pulled slightly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;They do stretch&quot; she said, her pace quickening. He pulled them a bit harder,
    separating them.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Still need to pee?&quot; she asked, now a bit weakly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not now!&quot; he answered emphatically. Suddenly she felt herself erupt in a
    seismic class explosion, her mind flashing, her body quivering as her sensations peaked,
    then slowly subsided. His release came a moment later, and she felt him explode. She
    collapsed in a heap on him, his hands still grasping her breasts.<br>
    <br>
    A few moments passed. &quot;Let's pee!&quot; she said, slowly rolling off him.<br>
    <br>
    Weakly, still a bit groggy from the physiological explosion within them both, they moved
    to the bathroom. She tugged him into the shower, then grasped him in an enthusiastic
    embrace. &quot;Just let go!&quot; she instructed him. They both stood, relaxing, as their
    bladders emptied together, the streams pouring down over their legs, mingling. Again she
    reflected that only a day earlier, she would never have considered doing anything like
    this.<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia turned to her mate and mused slowly, &quot;After being Lady Godiva, it's going to
    seem strange to walk around with clothes on! Wonder what kind of disgusting game they will
    have for next year?&quot; She turned on the shower to wash off the accumulation of dirt,
    ink, sweat, and the accumulated residue of the activities of last hours. Her body might be
    cleaned as it was yesterday, but she would not be the same again.<br>

    <br>
    ******************************************************************************</em><br>
    <br>
    <em>Observations from a Conference Participant:<br>
    <br>
    We attended the conference. A lot of the usual boring talk about the latest trends in
    structural design and computer assisted techniques. But then came what I consider the
    unforgettable moment of the night. The game committee had come up with a real dilly. Last
    year, there was a prize for the fellow who showed up with two sets of lady's underwear.
    The sexy thing was that the guys had to identify the donors. Oh, they got a prize, too,
    but they had to collect it at the stage, and everyone knew they were braless or panty-less
    for the rest of the evening. Now, the committee had to come up with something better.<br>
    <br>
    And they did! At least 100 of the women present had to volunteer to play in what they
    called &quot;The Lady Godiva Game&quot;. The chosen lady was expected to circulate through
    all the tables and interact with the guests for the rest of the evening, including having
    a drink at each table. While in the nude! All for a two thousand dollar prize.
    Fortunately, this contest was held here in Scandinavia, where the naked body is seen as
    something natural. Back home we'd have the vice squad thrown at us!<br>
    <br>
    Only volunteers were accepted. And can you imagine the surprise? The chosen woman was
    Sylvia Montfort. A sixty-three year old lady who is the wife of Art Montfort, the outgoing
    vice president of the International Society of Structural Design. I must admit that I, as
    most other people, I suppose, had a moment of dismay when she was chosen. Who's going to
    be interested in that old grandmother? <br>
    <br>
    At least, that was what everybody thought until the lady walked on stage. Sylvia Montfort
    looked like an empress, with her iron-gray shoulder length hair all in place and her regal
    stride up to the podium. She did undress down to her skin. Literally. She even took off
    all her jewelry and then descended to the floor just like she'd been born. The thing was
    that she did have a beautiful body. The droop of her breasts was just two or three inches.
    With those darker nipples standing out (it was either the cold or the emotion of standing
    there naked), who cared if her breasts drooped at all? The veins that showed under her
    skin only seemed as so many adornments. So, who cared? She was a truly beautiful mature
    woman, and a lot of the younger wives were feeling pangs of envy at not being chosen!<br>
    <br>
    Sylvia Montfort went from table to table with the dignity of royalty, complying with all
    the requirements of greeting everybody at the tables and partaking of some refreshment. I
    was sure she'd need some sort of relief from the liquid intake and at least twice she
    stopped at the same table and relieved herself in a cup offered by one of the gentlemen. <br>
    <br>
    The second time, she was thoroughly illuminated by a spotlight. I hope she did not feel
    shamed at this, as her figure was nothing less than exquisitely sensuous. At each table,
    she was signed off on her naked body to verify her attendance. I did it at my table, where
    she only had a sip of water. She was so poised and regal that I was the one feeling
    nervous as I wrote on her bare skin. Although I was sure she was in agony from all the
    liquid she'd consumed, exacerbated by the air conditioning cooling the room. <br>
    <br>
    Here was a woman consciously going through what many would consider shameful. And for
    what? A sense of honor and commitment? The feeling of choosing her own destiny? Whatever
    it was, it made her the most attractive and sensuous woman in the room, and all knew it.
    By the end of the spectacle, she definitely needed to relieve herself of all her liquid
    intake. Her husband had her clothing spirited out of the room and escorted her out clad in
    only his jacket. My guess was they were off to a rekindled romantic fire. <br>
    <br>
    My own spouse was not a little jealous of Sylvia Montfort. Maybe she secretly wished she'd
    have been chosen instead. That night, we complied with the Biblical dictum. &quot;Go Thou
    and do Likewise.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In the morning, I stepped to the window, while my love still slept, exhausted from the
    previous night. I was treated to the spectacle of a mature woman, still quite beautiful,
    stretching and showing herself in front of her hotel room's window. Was it Sylvia, from
    last night? She sure looked the same in the distance! In the background, an older man
    slept, also nude in the bed. Under most circumstances, I'd have retreated into the room
    and let them have their privacy. Not today. The shapely mature woman exhibited herself at
    the window. It seemed like she was aware I watched her. She straddled the man on the bed
    and brought him up to consciousness. Then she made love to him oblivious to the fact that
    they were giving me a show. When they retreated into their bathroom, I turned to my wife
    just as she awoke. Again, we spent the rest of the day trying out what I'd seen. <br>
    <br>
    I don't know if it was Sylvia and Art Montfort I'd seen. And I don't care. Because they
    inspired the best loving my wife and I had in years.<br>

    <strong>Reflections by Art</strong><br>
    <br>
    ******************************************************************************<br>
    <br>
    She's my wife. But her own woman. Always did what she thought right and I think she always
    will. She didn't know the Lady Godiva game had not been my idea, and I think she
    volunteered just to teach me a lesson. It sort of backfired when she was chosen, but she'd
    made a commitment and went through with it. She did not do a &quot;strip tease&quot; on
    stage, but undressed as modestly as the rules allowed. Then although I'm sure she was
    trembling with shame, she fulfilled what she'd agreed to. She went to each table and
    carried out the required function of accepting a toast and greeting everyone. She even put
    up with being signed off all over her body to show she'd been at each table.<br>
    <br>
    Angry? Jealous? Yes. I felt it. Not a cheated husband's jealousy. But that of a very
    selfish lover who wants this woman all to himself. She really put me to the test when she
    had me, of everybody else, sign on her naked skin when she visited our table. I could have
    made love to her there and then.<br>
    <br>
    I played a trick on her. I had all her clothes removed to our room. So she had to leave
    clad in my jacket. It was that or go naked. She needed to relieve herself at this point,
    but I wouldn't let her. Not until we made love. Afterwards, we did it in the shower, and
    she had her satisfaction of evening the score when it was I who needed to go and she
    insisted on making love again. This was like a rebirth. I was again blessed with<br>
    inaugurating her breasts that were so pliable to my hands and that would stretch
    effortlessly to where I took them. Her womanhood was still as tight and caressing as when
    we'd first made love, and her skin felt like silk in my hands.<br>
    <br>
    The next day, I woke up to find her on top of me, looking and acting like the young girl
    I'd married so long ago. I had a start at the open curtain, but after we began to make
    love, I did not care for anything anymore than sharing in love and sex with my wife and
    lover. Was the young man from the other tower looking at us being man and wife? Good. He
    might learn something. <br>
