    My Friend 
      Sue<br>
    </strong>
    </font><br><br><span lang="N"> </p>
      <p>I should really blame my friend Sue for my crazy turn-on. If it was not 
      for her I would still keep my knickers dry and would never have even 
      considered wearing a nappy and incontinence pants, let alone wetting them 
      in public.</p>
      <p>Sue and I met up at college and in our second year decided to share a 
      tiny flat together, kitchen, bathroom, small sitting room and a bedroom 
      with two single beds. I noticed that Sue always kept an old trunk in the 
      bedroom securely locked but never bothered to ask her what was in it. One 
      night we stayed in and drank rather too much wine. We began discussing 
      holiday journeys and the horrors of coach travel. We both decided that the 
      worst thing about coaches, apart from being cramped was the long periods 
      between stops - and the lack of toilets.</p>
      <p>I related the several times that I had been desperate by the time the 
      coach had reached a stop and had been terrified that I would wet myself as 
      I sat there. Blushing, I told her of the two occasions when, having 
      reached a stop, I hadn't managed to hold on. The first time I had reached 
      my home stop and rushed to the nearby toilets only to find them locked. I 
      had a walk of about 20 minutes to reach home but halfway there began to 
      wet my knickers. Fortunately it was dark and I struggled on, leaking 
      little spurts, trickles running down my tights. I felt my pants getting 
      wetter and wetter and after a few minutes thought to hell with it, and 
      just stood with my legs apart and wet myself totally. It was such a relief 
      that I was not really embarrassed by it. Nobody saw me and I was able to 
      quickly get home, shower and change.</p>
      <p>The second occasion was rather different. On a long journey I was 
      bursting when we reached a service area. I rushed to the loo but had to 
      wait in a queue where I stood wriggling about, praying I wouldn't lose all 
      control. When I am really bursting I tend to leak and could feel little 
      spurts of hot wee warming my crotch. At last I reached the cubicle but as 
      I locked the door and before I could lift my skirt and get my pants down 
      my bladder gave up. I began to wet myself and just couldn't stop. Without 
      thinking I simply sat on the toilet and peed, soaking my knickers and 
      tights. I managed to dry myself off with toilet paper and my black skirt 
      didn't show the wetness when I sat down, but I spent the rest of the 
      journey home in wet underwear, leaving a large damp patch on my seat when 
      I got off.</p>
      <p>Sue giggled, saying that not only had she found herself bursting to pee 
      in similar situations but had also wet herself. She told me of one time 
      when the coach had been stuck in a traffic jam and she had wet her seat. 
      She then revealed that this had been so embarrassing that she had decided 
      to take precautions on future journeys. I asked her what sort of 
      precautions. She blushed, whispering that she wore incontinence pads and 
      plastic pants. </p>
      <p>I was somewhat taken aback but asked her to explain further. She said 
      that a few days after she had soaked her knickers on the coach she had 
      noticed incontinence wear in the chemists and realised that protection 
      might be better than embarrassment. So, plucking up courage she had bought 
      herself a pack of adult disposable nappies and two pairs of waterproof 
      pants. She tried them on under a loose skirt and found them quite 
      comfortable and discrete. But did they work? Blushing scarlet she told me 
      that to test them out she had put on a black skirt, waited till she was 
      desperate and then sat on a garden chair and deliberately wet herself. She 
      had soaked the nappy but the plastic pants kept her clothes and the chair 
      quite dry.</p>
      <p>After that she wore this protection each time she travelled any 
      distance by coach. Most of the time she said that the added security made 
      her much more relaxed - if she did have a problem it would not matter if 
      she wet herself. And because it didn't matter she sometimes did just that 
      rather than endure the discomfort of an overfull bladder.</p>
      <p>Surprised yet intrigued I asked her if she had any nappies and 
      incontinence pants in the flat. She replied that that was why the trunk 
      was locked, as she went to find the key.</p>
      <p>Sue came back with the key and I followed her into the bedroom, feeling 
      a strange excitement at what would be revealed. She opened the trunk and 
      took out a holdall. Unzipping it she took out some items and placed on her 
      bed several pairs of waterproof pants and a big pack of incontinence 
      pads.</p>
      <p>Taking out a pad and unfolding it she passed it to me without a word. I 
      was surprised at what it looked like. I had expected an outsize baby's 
      nappy, but this was more like a pair of heavily padded knickers. I looked 
      at the pack more closely ? Tena Pants Plus, for heavy loss of bladder 
      control. Sue smiled, saying that she wasn't into baby wear, she was an 
      adult with an occasional bladder control problem and properly designed 
      incontinence garments gave her the protection and confidence she 
      needed.</p>
      <p>Sue explained that you wore them just like knickers; in her case with a 
      pair of full briefs,light lycra control briefs or a light girdle over the 
      top to disguise the slight bulge.. I asked whether she kept her normal 
      knickers on underneath, to which she replied that the pad was meant to 
      absorb the wee, leaving a dry surface for comfort. However, she always 
      wore cotton knickers as it was both more comfortable and felt rather nice 
      if she did have an accident! I became even more intrigued and she admitted 
      that it was nice in a sensual way. The waterproof pants were of two types. 
      One was simply white pvc the others looked like ordinary polyester briefs 
      but pvc lined. Sue told me that these were the most discrete and although 
      expensive did not rustle when she moved, unlike the basic plastic 
      knickers. In fact under a loose skirt no-one could tell that she was leak 
      proof.</p>
      <p>To demonstrate she began to put on the special pants, insisting that I 
      try a pair on as well. I was rather nervous about it but took a pair of 
      big lycra briefs from my drawer and copied Sue. Carefully positioning the 
      Tena I pulled my knickers up and looked at myself in the mirror. It really 
      was quite discrete, giving me the appearance of a slightly plump bottom 
      and thickness between my legs but not uncomfortable. I was almost 
      quivering with excitement as I pulled on the waterproof pants and stood 
      there looking at myself in the mirror. With my skirt back on it was true 
      that nobody could tell what I was wearing underneath.</p>
      <p>I asked what it felt like to do wee in these special clothes. Sue 
      responded by asking me what it had felt like when I had wet my knickers to 
      which I replied that it had felt warm and very wet, and then it had been a 
      relief. She grinned, saying it would feel much the same, except that the 
      wetness would not be running down my legs and making embarrassing 
      puddles.</p>
      <p>By this time we were both feeling the effects of the wine and needed to 
      wee quite badly. Sue then revealed more guilty secrets to me as she 
      complained that alcohol always seemed to go straight through her. I had 
      noticed when we went to a pub that she always seemed to be running to the 
      loo and always dashed straight to the bathroom when we got home. She then 
      told me several stories of wetting herself on the way home from pubs and 
      clubs. If on her own she did not even try to hold on. Standing in a quiet 
      shop doorway or between a couple of cars she would simply spread her legs 
      and wet her knickers. With friends she would just struggle on and hope she 
      made it home. She would have liked to wear protection but was afraid of 
      what a boyfriend might think if they found out. On a couple of occasions 
      she had had an accident in her knickers while walking home with a 
      boyfriend. One had called her disgusting and walked off and left her but 
      the other had been very protective and gentle, and, from her description 
      very turned on by the event.</p>
      <p>By this time we were both jiggling about and desperate. Sue said that 
      we ought to go to the loo before we both had an accident but since it 
      wouldn't matter why bother, it would give me a chance to try out my 
      protective underwear. She explained that it was best to sit or squat when 
      letting go as most of the absorbent gel and padding was in the crotch and 
      up the seat of the pad. Let go standing with a full bladder and the flood 
      could overwhelm the padding. </p>
      <p>Suddenly Sue gasped and with a serene smile on her face told me that 
      she was wetting herself. She was sitting on her bed with her knees up and 
      I could see right up her skirt. There was no sign of anything amiss in her 
      knickers and she obviously trusted her special underwear to protect her 
      bed. I was absolutely desperate too but kept hanging on. I finally decided 
      to go to loo but Sue stopped me, reminding me that I wanted to know what 
      it felt like to let go without any worries about the result. I felt myself 
      begin to leak, as I always do when bursting. Instinctively I tried to 
      control myself but my bladder took over and I felt a glorious hot wetness 
      spreading over my crotch and bottom. It was wonderful. I seemed to pee for 
      ages, all the time getting more and more turned on. I squeezed myself hard 
      between my legs and came to a shattering climax, oblivious of Sue or 
      anything else.</p>
      <p>As we talked afterwards, still in our wet pants, Sue admitted that she 
      too had brought herself off and that she found holding on stimulating. The 
      feeling of a full bladder, was, in the right circumstances, very pleasant 
      and the relief of emptying it exquisite. Losing control and the feeling of 
      a hot, wet stream in your pants was both sensual and with the excitement 
      of the added naughtiness.</p>
      <p>We drank more wine and both wet ourselves again as we talked for ages 
      about wet pleasures. Tired, we eventually went to bed, but not until Sue 
      had persuaded me to wear protective underwear next time we went out to the 
      pub.</p>
