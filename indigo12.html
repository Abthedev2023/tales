    <br>
    Claire carefully adjusted her top so that it would reveal as much of her cleavage as
    possible, and then bent down to help little Hannah take her dress off. As she did so, she
    peered over the rim of her sunglasses at the handsome young man on the opposite side of
    the courtyard. He'd noticed her, she was sure of that: but what was it he wanted to see?
    That was the question. Tits or legs? Well, she thought, as she gathered the girls' dresses
    together, I can always make sure he gets a good eyeful of both, just to make sure.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right, monsters,&quot; she said, giving Jane a friendly pat on the bottom as she did
    so. The girls all giggled. They liked it when Claire called them monsters. &quot;You can
    go and play in the fountains if you want to. But just remember I've not brought anything
    for you to change into, so if you get your knickers wet you're just going to have to wear
    them like that for the rest of the day. Got that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes Auntie Claire,&quot; they chirruped in unison.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Off you all go, then.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They didn't need telling twice. All three girls turned and ran straight into the middle of
    the fountains, and in next to no time they were screaming and splashing with the other
    children. Claire also noticed, with an indulgent smile, that hardly had they entered the
    fountains when all three girls were completely drenched, knickers and all. Well, she
    thought, that's children for you. There'd just better not be any grizzling later in the
    day when they were cold and damp and uncomfortable.<br>
    <br>
    The three girls - Rebecca, Jane and Hannah - weren't actually Claire's nieces. For the
    past two summers she had managed to earn enough to make considerable inroads into her
    student debts by working as a live-in mother's help, looking after the girls while their
    high-powered parents were off at work doing whatever it is that high-powered parents do.
    It was Ian and Margot, her employers, who had introduced her to their daughters as
    &quot;Auntie Claire,&quot; and that was what the girls had always called her. She didn't
    mind. They were smashing kids: she doted on them, and they adored her. So much so that
    there had been no end of tears when she explained that as she was on a four year course
    and would be looking to find a permanent job after she graduated, this was going to be the
    last summer that she looked after them. The girls had put their heads together and
    announced that they would sulk all summer unless she changed her plans and agreed to look
    after them every summer for ever and ever; but with skilful diplomacy and more than a
    little hard bargaining, Claire had managed to buy of their sulks with the promise of lots
    and lots and lots of outings this summer to make up. Which was fine by her, because taking
    the girls on outings was the part of her job she liked the best.<br>
    <br>
    She'd taken them on this year's outing the day before. They had gone for a ride on the
    London Eye: an enormous Ferris wheel on the south bank of the river Thames. You ride in
    glass capsules, and from the top of the wheel you can see the whole of London, or so it
    appeared.<br>
    <br>
    Outings this year were easier, too, because there was so much less to carry. Rebecca had
    seen to that. As they were getting ready to go to the Eye, Claire had gone upstairs to the
    girls' bedrooms to collect some &quot;emergency things&quot; - spare knickers, socks,
    shorts and T-shirts, which she always took on outings just in case any of the girls had an
    accident. She went to Hannah's room first, but when she had found what she needed in
    Hannah's chest of drawers and turned to leave the room, Rebecca was standing in the
    doorway.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What are you doing, Auntie Claire?&quot; she asked, looking suspiciously at the
    clothes in Claire's hands.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm just getting the emergency things together.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because I can't take them with us if I don't fetch them first, can I?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; Rebecca persisted, &quot;but why do you want to take them?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You know why I take them, Rebecca love. It's just in case of accidents.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't you think we're getting a bit old for that now, Auntie Claire?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire thought about it. Rebecca was nine; and Hannah, the youngest, was now seven. Last
    year she'd dutifully carried the &quot;emergency things&quot; with her on every outing
    they'd been on, and not needed them once. The year before she'd only needed them twice -
    once for Jane, who had just turned six, and once for Hannah, who was five at the time. But
    even little Hannah was seven now, and maybe Rebecca had a point. So she'd gone back
    downstairs and called the girls together, and asked them whether they all thought it would
    be unnecessary for her to carry &quot;emergency things&quot; with her on outings this
    year. They had all agreed with Rebecca, so that was decided.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you don't have to carry the emergency things with you everywhere,&quot; said
    Rebecca, &quot;you'll have a free hand. Which will make it much easier for you to eat ice
    cream with us, won't it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; Claire laughed, &quot;I suppose it will.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh goody!&quot; cried Jane, just a little too enthusiastically. &quot;Does that mean
    you're going to buy us all lots and lots of ice cream?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I should think I'll be buying you some,&quot; said Claire, who had realised just
    that little bit too late how comprehensively the girls had stitched her up. &quot;But not
    lots and lots, because it'll fill you up and make you want to keep running off for a wee
    all the time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We'll manage,&quot; said Rebecca.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You'd better,&quot; Claire had chuckled. &quot;After all, we're going out without
    emergency things this year, remember.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And so they had set out for the London Eye, with Claire reflecting on the fact that whilst
    the girls might be able to stuff ice cream all day and not suffer for it, she probably
    couldn't. For, unlike Rebecca, she had not been dry at seven, or even nine. She had
    continued having occasional daytime wetting accidents right up until she went to
    university; and once she was there she soon acquired a reputation as &quot;the girl who
    wets herself when she gets drunk&quot;. This was not without its advantages, of course.
    For one thing it meant that the boys were always falling over themselves to buy her
    drinks; and for another, it meant that she had never had a boy invite her back to his
    place after a party. They always suggested going to hers, instead. Which meant that the
    few times she had woken up the morning after in a wet bed with a stranger beside her, it
    was at least her own bed, and there was a selection of her own dry clothes close at hand
    to change into. She had never had to walk back through town in wet clothes, which was at
    least something.<br>
    <br>
    While they rode the London eye, they discussed the various places that Claire could take
    them for outings this year, and tried to decide where they wanted to go. The final list
    was absurdly long, but Claire promised she'd discuss it with their parents and see how
    many of them she could get onto the agenda. They were happy with that, so she bought them
    all an ice cream when the ride was over.<br>
    <br>
    Today had dawned bright and clear and stiflingly hot, and Claire had said that no way was
    she going to take them to Brighton as originally intended. An hour and a half cooped up in
    a stuffy train without any sort of air conditioning on a day such as today was not her
    idea of fun; and the girls probably wouldn't care for it all that much, either. So she
    tore up the original plan for the day and took them to Somerset House instead. They
    arrived just as the fountains began one of their computer-controlled displays of
    &quot;dancing&quot; - the jets suddenly becoming more powerful and taller, then less so,
    in a bewildering and beautifully choreographed array of different geometric and rhythmic
    variations. The girls had loved it, but soon tired of just watching. There were other
    children actually playing in among the water jets - some fully clothed, some in swimming
    costumes, the very youngest totally naked - and the girls had pestered Claire to be
    allowed to go and join the fun. Claire had agreed on two conditions: that they stripped to
    their knickers so as not to get their other clothes wet, and that they didn't grizzle if
    they got their knickers wet and had to continue wearing them because she had brought
    nothing for them to change into. The girls readily consented to her conditions, and as a
    result Claire was now free to see if she could work her charms on the handsome stranger on
    the other side of the quadrangle.<br>
    <br>
    She ambled over to the corner of the courtyard, where there were tables and chairs were
    all laid out, and carefully folded the girls' dresses. Then, having placed them neatly on
    the table furthest from the fountains, she sat in a chair facing the young man and
    carefully adjusted the hem of her skirt. She tried to make it look as though she was
    baring as much of her legs to the sun as she could without showing any onlookers anything
    more than a bit of thigh. In reality, however, she knew she had lifted her skirt too far
    for that, and that from where he stood the young man would now have a fair view of her
    crisp, white cotton knickers- and of the whole of her legs, of course. So that whether it
    was tits or legs that excited him, he'd seen them both now and would hopefully show an
    interest. She settled back into her chair and waited.<br>
    <br>
    It didn't take long. Within a couple of minutes the stranger had wandered across to her
    table. He was trying to look nonchalant; but Claire noticed that as he approached he
    always kept himself in a perfect position to see up her skirt. He also had to walk past
    several unoccupied seats and one completely clear table to reach her. She had her
    sunglasses on, so he couldn't see that she was observing him closely; and she took care
    that the rest of her body, which he could see, appeared to be ignoring his approach.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi,&quot; he said, smiling down at her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi,&quot; she said, carefully not smiling back, but turning towards him in such a
    way as to flash even more of her knickers. She noted with satisfaction the effect this had
    on the front of his jeans.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He sat down.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you planning to stay for long?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That depends upon the girls,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll stay as long as they want
    to.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ah yes,&quot; he said, fingering the fabric of the neatly folded dress at the top of
    the neat little pile of clothes on the table. &quot;The girls: your daughters?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How old do you think I am?&quot; Claire spluttered indignantly, brushing her skirt
    down a bit so as to deny the cheeky pup the pleasure of seeing her knickers.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's difficult to say,&quot; the man replied evenly. &quot;But if you were to remove
    those sunglasses, I might be able to make a more accurate assessment. It always helps to
    be able to see a person's eyes, don't you think?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire grinned, and removed the shades.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ah,&quot; said the man. &quot;Obviously not your daughters. Your little sisters,
    perhaps?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not even that,&quot; said Claire. &quot;I'm their nanny.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;God's teeth!&quot; exclaimed the man, his face assuming a terribly over-acted
    expression of horror. &quot;And there was me thinking you weren't even old enough to be
    their mother. You must be a lot older than you look.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't mean that sort of nanny,&quot; Claire said, smiling despite herself. &quot;I
    look after them every summer while their parents are at work.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What fun,&quot; said the man.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is,&quot; said Claire. &quot;It pays well, too. And I get to do all the things
    I'd have loved to do when I was a kid but never did because my parents couldn't afford it.
    We went on the Eye yesterday. We're going to the zoo tomorrow. And we've got plans to go
    bowling and pony riding, and on a river boat, and to the London dungeon, not to mention
    day trips to just about every seaside resort within day trip range of London.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sounds exhausting,&quot; said the man. &quot;Thirsty work, I'll bet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It can be,&quot; said Claire. &quot;But it beats stacking shelves in Asda.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I guess,&quot; he said. &quot;Look, I'm awfully thirsty myself and I'm just about to
    go for a drink. Can I get you something?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Claire. &quot;Anything long and cold will do.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay,&quot; said the man. &quot;By the way, I'm Phil.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Claire,&quot; said Claire.<br>
    <br>
    Phil went to fetch the drinks, and while he was away Claire adjusted her skirt again so
    he'd get just the slightest glimpse of her knickers when he returned. After all, he had
    really only been joking when he pretended to interpret the word &quot;nanny&quot; as
    meaning that she was the girls' grandmother; and it had been quite funny, after all. A
    minute or two later he returned with the drinks, and they sat and chatted for what seemed
    like ages. She told him all about herself - well, not quite all - and about life at
    university.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I wish I'd been able to go to university,&quot; he said a little wistfully.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So why didn't you?&quot; she asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll tell you when I get back,&quot; he replied, and took their empty glasses for
    refills.<br>
    <br>
    It turned out that Phil was dyslexic, but wasn't diagnosed until he was fifteen. By that
    time it was too late for him to have any hope of passing any exams, even with specialist
    help.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But it wasn't all bad,&quot; he grinned.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why's that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; he explained, &quot;we dyslexics can't picture things in our heads. We
    can't hold a mental image.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What, not at all?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;My dreams are like radio plays: all dialogue and no
    pictures. Whereas yours, I understand, are more like television.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Claire. &quot;Second rate low budget B-movies for the most part in
    my case.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There you are then,&quot; said Phil. &quot;I don't get any of that, and I can't
    picture anything except what I can actually see in front of me at the time. Which turns
    out to be a tremendous boon in my line of work.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Which is?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm a photographer,&quot; said Phil.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So where are your cameras?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;At home,&quot; he shrugged. &quot;I'm just on a reconnaissance mission today. Casing
    the joint, as it were; looking for angles, and lighting effects. The fountains are really
    wonderful and I can do all sorts of things with them. Or could, if only it wasn't for all
    the children.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't you like children then?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh it's not that,&quot; said Phil. &quot;I'd love to be able to do some stuff with
    children. I mean, look at them all, enjoying themselves in the fountains- pure joy on
    their faces- simple, innocent fun; consisting of nothing more than shrieking and running
    about and getting wet. Like that little girl over there standing so the fountain squirts
    up her skirt. Or that one, in just her knickers, sitting underneath another of the
    fountains.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's one of mine,&quot; said Claire. &quot;And I've not got any dry things for her
    to change into, so she'd better not grizzle about having to wear wet underwear.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She won't,&quot; said Phil. &quot;That's an adult concern, having wet clothes. Kids
    aren't bothered at all, especially not in the summer. And that's why I'd love to be able
    to do some stuff with children. Capture the innocence of youth. The complete absence of
    adult cares and concerns.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So what's stopping you?&quot; asked Claire.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Perceptions,&quot; said Phil. &quot;I look out there and I see happy, joyful kids
    having a whale of a time. But other people don't always think in those terms, you know.
    They see naked kiddies, or kids in just their knickers, and if they saw me taking
    photographs of that they'd lynch me. Or smash my cameras, at the very least. Either way,
    it wouldn't be a very good career move.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I suppose not,&quot; agreed Claire.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Anyway,&quot; said Phil, eyeing her empty glass. &quot;Are you ready for
    another?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire thought about it. If it was one of the girls asking for a third glass of something
    to drink, she'd almost certainly have vetoed the idea for fear of toilet emergencies later
    in the day. But she was still feeling thirsty, so the thought of toilet emergencies didn't
    really enter her head; or if it did, it was soon dismissed as a nonsensical fear. Which
    was silly, really, because with her track record, she was probably just as much at risk as
    any of the girls. And whereas, in previous years, she had always quietly slipped a pair of
    her own knickers in with the emergency things &quot;just in case&quot;, the girls'
    decision that they should go out without emergency things this year had deprived her of
    that reassuring safety net. But she didn't really worry too much about that, as she
    guessed that there must be some public toilets available somewhere in Somerset House, and
    in any event the bus ride home wasn't all that long. So she accepted Phil's offer; and
    when he arrived back with another drink for her she gulped about half of it down straight
    away.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So,&quot; said Phil. &quot;Which are your three girls?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The oldest is Rebecca,&quot; said Claire. &quot;She's the one running in and out of
    the fountains over on the far side. Then there's Jane. She's the one you noticed earlier,
    sitting under the fountain getting thoroughly soaked. And the youngest is Hannah.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Which one's she?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She's, um,&quot; Claire scanned the children playing in the fountains, but she
    couldn't immediately see Hannah. &quot;She was in the fountains a moment ago.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire searched the fountains more closely. No Hannah. Ah well, she told herself. She
    can't have gone far. She's probably playing with some newfound friends somewhere else in
    the courtyard. So she turned and looked round the rest of the large quadrangle. Still no
    Hannah, she realised. And now she was starting to worry. She felt an unwelcome sensation
    of panic rising inside her, and fought desperately to keep it under control. Her insides
    began to quiver, and a sudden chill passed through her stomach and bladder, making her
    aware of a pressing need to go to the toilet, which she had been ignoring for the last
    quarter of an hour because she had been enjoying Phil's company so much. She fought
    desperately to keep that under control, too. But it was difficult, because her mind was
    already full of horrible images of which might have become of little Hannah, wandering off
    on her own wearing nothing but her knickers. And what if any harm had come to her, when
    Claire was supposed to be looking after her and keeping an eye on her? It was just too
    awful to contemplate.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Rebecca! Jane!&quot; she called, trying to keep the panic from registering in her
    voice, but without much success. &quot;Can you come here a moment.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The two older girls ran, dripping, to her table.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What is it, Auntie Claire?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Please don't say it's time to go home, Auntie Claire. We're having so much
    fun.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do either of you know where Hannah is?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Rebecca looked thoughtful, but said nothing.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She said she needed a wee,&quot; said Jane. &quot;And she was afraid she might have
    an accident if she tried to hold on much longer, so she went to find a toilet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When was that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, ages ago,&quot; said Jane.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And have you seen her since?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Great! So Hannah had wandered off in search of a toilet and got herself lost. She could be
    almost anywhere. Or she could have been abducted. Or hurt herself. Or fallen down a hole
    somewhere. Who knew what might have happened? And of course the silly thing about it all
    was that sitting there in the fountains; it wouldn't have mattered if she had had an
    accident. Who would have known, except her? But when you're seven you don't think like
    that, do you? Claire herself remembered her guide mistress taking them all to an adventure
    playground assault course type thing. She must have been eleven or twelve. They'd had a
    wonderful time, really enjoyed it, but by the time they got to the last obstacle she was
    absolutely desperate for the toilet, shamelessly holding herself between her legs. That
    last obstacle was a fallen tree trunk bridging a small river, and she needed to put her
    arms out to help her balance as she crossed. Only she didn't think she'd be able to let go
    between her legs without wetting herself. She'd ended up losing her balance and falling
    into the river, and the shock of entering the cold water very nearly caused her to lose
    control of her bladder and start peeing in her knickers. But by a massive effort she
    managed to stop that happening (well, she may have leaked a little; but nothing major)
    even though nobody could possibly have known whether she had wet herself while she was in
    the river or not. They'd all had to take spare clothes with them in case of just such a
    mishap, so the guide mistress took her to the warden's office where she was given a towel
    to dry herself off and get changed into her spare clothes. And it was only then that she
    suddenly realised that she couldn't hold on a moment longer, and had promptly pissed
    herself. Now, of course, she had no dry clothes to change into after her accident, and
    everyone had found out about it.<br>
    <br>
    So yes, if she'd been Hannah she'd probably have done exactly the same thing too. But that
    wasn't much consolation just at the moment. She had a problem: Hannah was missing. She had
    another problem, too, which was that all this talk of finding toilets, and recalling her
    own childhood accidents, combined with the gurgling hiss and splash of the fountains (of
    which she was suddenly much more keenly aware than she had been) was making her
    uncomfortable aware of just how much she, too, was in need of a wee. She'd been putting it
    to the back of her mind while she relaxed and enjoyed Phil's company: just as when she was
    little she had so often ignored the mounting pressure in her bladder if she was
    particularly absorbed in what she was doing - frequently with embarrassing consequences.
    Indeed, if there was one thing her frequent childhood accidents ought to have taught her,
    it was that when she got to this stage she really ought to drop everything she was doing
    and go find a toilet at once. Today, however, her priorities were different. Today she
    needed to drop everything she was doing, and go find Hannah.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come along girls,&quot; she said to Rebecca and Jane. &quot;Put your dresses back
    on, and hurry.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can I help in any way?&quot; asked Phil.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't think so,&quot; said Claire. &quot;I don't think you'll be any more welcome
    searching the ladies' toilets for a lost seven year old wearing nothing but her knickers
    than you would have been photographing her when she was sitting in the fountains.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; Phil mused. &quot;I guess not.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I don't suppose you actually happen to know where the ladies toilets are, though, do
    you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; said Phil. &quot;I've never actually needed to find that one
    out.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Looking for the lavs are you, dear?&quot; asked a kindly looking old lady who
    happened to be passing and had obviously overheard that last exchange. &quot;They're just
    round the end of that building there, loo'.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Rebecca and Jane had got their dresses and flip-flops back on now, so Claire took one of
    their hands in each of hers, thanked the lady, and headed off in the direction she had
    pointed. The toilets took some finding: round the end of the building, through a door,
    along a corridor and down a flight of stairs. But eventually she found them and went in.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hannah?&quot; she called.<br>
    <br>
    Silence.<br>
    <br>
    There were four cubicles, and she tried them all, one by one. All were empty. Moreover,
    there was no sign at all that Hannah had been there. No little wet footprints on the
    floor. No running tap that Hannah had been able to turn on with dry hands, but not off
    again with wet hands (she never thought to dry her hands and then return to the tap).
    There was nothing at all to suggest that the little girl had succeeded in her quest to
    find a toilet. In which case, where could she have gone? Claire absolutely had to find
    her. She absolutely had to have a wee, too, and she thought about stopping to use a toilet
    while she was here. It made sense. But it would also take time; and she might not have
    much time. Before she could make up her mind, however, the decision was taken for her.
    Somebody else came into the room, and Jane promptly asked her &quot;Have you seen our
    sister?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; said the lady.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We've lost our little sister.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Lost her?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let me explain,&quot; said Claire, hurriedly. &quot;I'm these girls' nanny; and they
    were playing in the fountains with their seven year old sister. Hannah came looking for a
    toilet, and hasn't been seen since. We thought she might still be here, but she isn't. And
    it doesn't look as though she has a ever been here, either.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Perhaps she went to the other toilets, then,&quot; suggested the lady.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The other toilets?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, on the south terrace. You've got to go through the building opposite the Strand
    entrance to get to it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jane, seizing the girls' hands once more and dashing back out
    into the courtyard. Through the building opposite the Strand entrance, the lady had said.
    That involved passing the fountains again; and as she did so Claire began to think it had
    been a big mistake not to use the toilets while she had the chance. She was more desperate
    now than she could ever remember being during her adult life (at least while sober) and it
    felt as though she wouldn't be able to hold on for very much longer. So she stopped for a
    moment and squeezed her thighs tightly together, which helped a bit, and then carried on a
    little more awkwardly than before. Rebecca looked at her thoughtfully, but said nothing.<br>
    <br>
    The south terrace was long, very long. And they came out onto it somewhere near the
    middle. There was no clear indication which way they should turn for the toilets, so
    Claire guessed which way they ought to go; and she guessed wrong. She gasped in dismay
    when they came to the end of the terrace and there was no sign of the toilets. Her pee was
    threatening to come rushing out at any moment, and she had just walked a hundred metres or
    so in the wrong direction. Now she needed to retrace her steps, and then continue goodness
    only knew how far in the opposite direction in order to find some toilets. She didn't know
    if she'd be able to make it. But she had to try. She had to find Hannah.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you alright, Auntie Claire?&quot; Rebecca sounded concerned.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes dear, I'm fine,&quot; she tried to reassure her. &quot;I just think we should
    have turned the other way for the toilets, that's all.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They hurried back along the terrace; but as they finally neared the toilets Claire felt a
    terrible wave of desperation pass through her bladder and had to stop dead and squeeze her
    thighs together for all she was worth to stay in control of her bladder and avoid a
    horribly embarrassing accident in front of all the people on the terrace. While she was
    distracted by this, Rebecca and Jane ran ahead of her and went into the toilets,
    re-emerging a moment or two later.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She's not there, Auntie Claire,&quot; announced Jane.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh no!&quot; wailed Claire. &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; The question might
    just as well have related to her need to relieve her bladder as to the fact that Hannah
    was still missing. Now that these toilets had been thoroughly searched, there was no
    reason why she should go in and search them herself; and so she couldn't quietly interrupt
    her search for a surreptitious wee while she was there. She had to get on with the search
    for Hannah But where next? She had no idea. It was all just too much for her, and she felt
    herself on the verge of tears. But she couldn't give in to them. Mustn't give in to them.
    Not in front of the girls.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can I help you at all, madam?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire looked up, and this time she could have cried with relief. There was a uniformed
    security guard with a walkie-talkie radio in his hand. She wanted to kiss him!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you wouldn't mind,&quot; said Claire, hopping desperately from foot to foot as
    she did so. &quot;I've lost a little girl. Seven years old. Wandered off from the
    fountains in just her knickers. You've not seen her, have you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I haven't,&quot; said the guard. &quot;But someone else might have done. I'll radio
    in and see what I can find out.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He lifted the radio to his cheek and pressed a button. &quot;Hello, control room?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire stood anxiously rubbing her foot against the back of her calf, the curtsied a
    little to help her stay in control of her tortured bladder, while the radio crackled and
    hissed. The guard tried again.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hello, control room. This is Jeff.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The radio fell silent- then a voice. &quot;Control room here. Go ahead, Jeff.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, I'm on the south terrace and I have a lady here who's lost her daughter. Seven
    years old. Has anyone seen a little girl wandering about anywhere?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll ask around and get back to you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The radio fell silent again. Claire, too, was silent. She was standing there nervously,
    waiting for a reply, within sight of the toilets yet she dared not go and use them until
    she heard back and knew Hannah was safe. Her bladder was screaming for relief; but it
    would just have to wait, she told herself, until Hannah was found.<br>
    <br>
    After what seemed like an eternity but was probably no more than a minute or two, the
    radio crackled into life again. &quot;Jeff? Can you bring the lady round to control?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Will do.&quot; Then, to Claire, &quot;Would you and your other two daughters like to
    come with me?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He led them back into the courtyard and past the gurgling fountains, Claire throwing a
    wistful glance over her shoulder in the direction of the toilets as they went. The sound
    of splashing water was everywhere, and Claire gasped as she realised that she was finally
    beginning to lose control. She felt herself beginning to wee, and there was nothing she
    could do about it. She was clenching her muscles as tightly as she could, as tightly as
    she ever had. She managed to stop the wee from flowing, but only after she had already
    leaked a little. Not much, maybe. Her knickers felt no more than a little damp between the
    legs- for now. But she knew she wouldn't be able to hang on for much longer now. She
    needed to get to a toilet!<br>
    <br>
    The security guard led them to a little side room, where another, female security guard
    was sitting with Hannah on her knee. Hannah had a steaming mug of tea in her hands, a
    plate of chocolate biscuits on the table in front of her, and a huge grin on her face.
    Claire was so relieved to see her! She felt all the built-up anxiety and panic flowing out
    of her as she began to relax once again; and then felt her cheeks turning bright red as
    she realised with a start that, as she relaxed, something else was flowing out of her too!
    She tensed her muscles again and squeezed her thighs together, and managed to stop it once
    more, but not before she felt a gentle trickle of warm pee running down the inside of her
    thigh. Her knickers felt decidedly wet now; but looking around the small room, it didn't
    seem that anyone else had noticed. She breathed a sigh of relief. Thank goodness for that!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;She came wandering in looking for a toilet,&quot; the female security guard
    explained. &quot;I told her where the public toilets were, but she was hopping from foot
    to foot and said she couldn't wait any longer, so I took pity on her and took her to the
    staff toilets.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And I did manage to hold on, Auntie Claire,&quot; said Hannah triumphantly through a
    mouthful of chocolate biscuit. &quot;My knickers were wet from the fountains but I didn't
    have an accident.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The security guard smiled indulgently. &quot;I didn't realise she'd been in the fountains,
    though, and when she said she didn't like pulling her knickers back up because they were
    all wet I just assumed she'd had an accident and told her not to worry, if she passed them
    out under the door I'd use the hot air hand dryer to dry them off for her.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire was trembling now with the effort of keeping her muscles clenched tight enough to
    keep from wetting herself again, and she was beginning to think that she might be needing
    that hand dryer herself in a moment; but there was no stopping the security guard, who
    clearly wanted to tell the whole of her story.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It took much longer than I thought it would to dry her knickers completely like
    that, and by the time I took her back out into the courtyard she was worrying that you
    might have gone home without her. When we looked for you and her sisters in the courtyard,
    you weren't there, and she burst into tears. I guessed that you were probably looking for
    her rather than going home without her, so I brought her to the security control room
    reckoning that you'd be bound to ask a security guard if they'd seen her sooner or
    later.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And she gave me lots and lots of biscuits and tea to cheer me up,&quot; beamed
    Hannah. &quot;This is my third cup.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oh great, thought Claire. That's really helpful. A little girl full of tea on the bus
    journey home is an accident just waiting to happen. And with that thought, her mind was
    brought back to her own predicament once again.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, thank you,&quot; said Claire, feeling another little trickle running down her
    thigh and grimacing as she struggles to bring her bladder back under control but realising
    that she was fighting a losing battle. &quot;Can I beg another big favour, though?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can I use your staff loo too, please?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The female security guard took in Claire's awkward, desperate stance at a glance and
    realised at once that she was not going to be able to make it to either of the public
    toilets. She smiled. &quot;Of course. Along the corridor, second on the left.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire thanked her profusely and hobbled along the corridor as best she could; but by now
    she was too far gone to hold everything back, and she was peeing little spurts into her
    knickers at virtually every step. By the time she reached the toilet there were steady
    little rivulets coursing down both her thighs. Her face was flushed with the humiliation
    of it all, and she was crying tears of frustration that she had been unable to hang on
    just that little bit longer. But the worst was still to come. As she stepped into the
    little cubicle the sight of the toilet bowl in front of her proved just too much, and her
    bladder simply relaxed completely there and then. With an embarrassingly loud hissing
    sound, the pee started gushing out between her legs big time. Straight through the sodden
    fabric of her knickers and down to the floor where it splashed and splattered and puddled
    at her feet. Frantically gathering up the hem of her little mini skirt she resignedly sat
    down on the toilet and just let it all flood out through her knickers.<br>
    <br>
    When she was done she stood up and took stock of the situation. Her knickers, naturally,
    were sodden, and she couldn't afford the time it would take to dry them with the hot air
    dryer; but her skirt was unmarked and if she was careful she could keep it that way as
    long as she didn't have to sit down again before she had a chance to change. There was a
    puddle on the floor, though, about a foot across and she was going to have to tell the
    security guard about that. And then there was the bus journey home. How was she going to
    explain to the girls that she wanted to stand the whole way even though there was bound to
    be a seat available? It wasn't going to be easy; that was for sure. But first things
    first: the puddle.<br>
    <br>
    As Claire made her soggy and miserable way back to the security guards' room, she had an
    idea. She felt a bit of a heel about actually carrying it out; but it would spare her
    blushes and hurt nobody, so she managed to convince herself that she was justified in
    doing so.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's time we were going, girls,&quot; she said on entering the room. &quot;Rebecca,
    Jane, can you help Hannah put her dress back on? I must just have a quick word with the
    security guard.&quot; She motioned to the female security guard, and they stepped out of
    the room together.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm terribly sorry about this,&quot; she said in a hushed voice, which the girls
    wouldn't be able to hear, &quot;but I don't think that was just fountain water you were
    drying out of Hannah's knickers.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh?&quot; said the guard.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I'm afraid there's a little puddle on the floor of your
    toilet, so it looks as though Hannah might not have made it in time after all. But don't
    mention it in front of the others, will you? Hannah would be mortified if her sisters
    found out she'd had a little accident.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't worry,&quot; beamed the guard. &quot;She's a lovely kid and I wouldn't want to
    embarrass her. When you've had an accident you don't want other people to know if you can
    possible help it, do you? So we'll say no more about it, and I'll get someone to clean up
    after you've gone.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Claire, relieved that phase one of the plan had worked at any
    rate. But she still had her own wet knickers to worry about.<br>
    <br>
    She led the girls back out into the courtyard. The fountains were all subdued now: little
    jets no more than a foot or so high. But Claire knew that they started to dance every half
    hour, and the courtyard clock told her that the next show was only a minute or two away.
    So it was time to put phase two of her plan into operation.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay girls,&quot; she clapped her hands. &quot;Let's see who can run down the entire
    length of the fountains, over the top of each one, without getting wet. There's an ice
    cream in it for anyone who can.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you want us to take our dresses off again?&quot; asked Jane.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, no,&quot; said Claire. &quot;That's the challenge. Keep your dresses on, but
    keep them dry.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The three girls whooped with delight, and ran the entire length of the fountain display.
    The promise of ice cream made them all careful, and all three arrived safe and dry at the
    other end. Claire waited behind, watching the clock.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aren't you coming, Auntie Claire?&quot; called Rebecca.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Of course I am,&quot; Claire called back to her. &quot;Did you all manage to keep
    dry?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes Auntie Claire&quot; they sang in unison.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right then,&quot; said Claire. &quot;Let's see if I can do as well as you little
    monsters.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The clock began to strike, and Claire ran out into the middle of the fountains just as the
    computer-controlled show began. As she passed over the first row of jets that suddenly
    sprang up into six-foot columns of water, one of which shot straight up her skirt. It was
    what she'd been hoping for, but it still took her by surprise and she screamed in shock.
    The girls, too, screamed: but with laughter.<br>
    <br>
    By the time Claire reached the other end of the courtyard, three fountains had caught her.
    Her knickers, already wet with pee, had been thoroughly soaked with clean, cold fountain
    water and her skirt and blouse, too, were dripping wet. She looked down at herself and
    laughed. &quot;No ice cream for me, then.&quot; The girls giggled.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are your knickers wet, Auntie Claire?&quot; asked Rebecca.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; said Claire. &quot;They're completely soaked.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Rebecca wagged her finger sternly at Claire. &quot;You're not to grizzle about it on the
    bus going home.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire laughed, and bought the girls their ice creams. When they had all finished, she
    sent them to the toilet again before they headed home, and looked around the courtyard for
    Phil. He was still there, looking at angles and lighting effects. She caught his eye and
    he came ambling across.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi again.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi,&quot; she said. &quot;We're heading off home now. Thanks for all the
    drinks.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Here,&quot; he said, drawing something out of his pocket and pressing it into her
    hand. &quot;My card. If you'd ever like to do a bit of modelling, give me a ring.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said. &quot;I will.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And then the girls were back, and they headed for the bus stop. They had the bus
    practically to themselves, and had no difficulty finding four seats all together. Claire
    insisted that Jane and Rebecca, whose knickers were still wet from the fountains, lift up
    their dresses at the back so as not to get them wet when they sat down, and then did the
    same herself. She was aware that the girls were watching her closely, and as they giggled
    and whispered among themselves Claire distinctly heard Jane saying, &quot;she's wearing
    white ones.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    When they got home, the girls asked if they could go out in the garden and have a water
    fight. It was still very hot, and Claire readily agreed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Take your dresses off again first, though,&quot; she said as she filled their Super
    Squirters for them, refusing to issue the weapons until all three girls had once again
    stripped down to their knickers.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you going to come and join in, Auntie Claire?&quot; asked Rebecca.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are only the three water guns,&quot; said Claire.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's alright,&quot; said Jane. &quot;We'll let you use the garden hose. And you
    can keep your bra on too, if you like. We won't mind.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire smiled. The back garden wasn't overlooked, and she didn't mind the girls seeing her
    in her underwear, so she took off her wet skirt and blouse. The girls whooped with joy,
    and all four of them ran out into the garden where they were soon dripping from head to
    toe. After half an hour, Claire said &quot;I'd better go and make your tea now. I'll call
    you all when it's time to come in and dry off.&quot; Then she went into the house and
    changed into dry clothes. When she came back down into the kitchen, the three girls were
    standing there waiting for her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't you want to keep on playing?&quot; she asked them.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We've just been thinking,&quot; said Rebecca.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And talking,&quot; chipped in Hannah.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; said Rebecca. &quot;And talking. And we all felt very sorry for you and
    hoped you wouldn't be too upset about your accident.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;My accident?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Wetting your knickers,&quot; explained Hannah.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Whatever makes you think I wet my knickers?&quot; said Claire.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It showed,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Running into the fountains to cover it up was a
    good idea, but it didn't wash out the yellow wee-stain altogether. I saw it when you sat
    down on the bus, and we all saw it when you came out into the garden for the water fight.
    You might have got away with it if you'd been wearing dark blue, but white isn't nearly so
    forgiving of accidents you know.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Claire. She did know this, of course; and remembered from her own
    childhood the rite of passage which choosing to wear white knickers rather than dark blue
    represented. It was a statement. A proclamation to the whole world - or at least to all
    those who might see your knickers - that you weren't apprehensive of having an accident.
    It was a statement that she, personally, had never made; although nowadays she bought her
    knickers in multipacks, which usually included at least one white pair, so she wore white
    knickers from time to time.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So we decided,&quot; continued Rebecca, &quot;that if you want to carry your own
    emergency things when we go on outings, we'll let you take emergency things for us, too,
    so people don't realise that you're the one who sometimes wets her knickers.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Claire. &quot;That's very thoughtful of you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But that doesn't mean that just because you've not got a free hand any more you can
    get away without buying us ice cream,&quot; said Jane.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; said Hannah. &quot;And if you don't want us to tell anybody else about
    your little accident, you'd better make sure you buy us lots and lots and lots of ice
    cream.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Claire began to sense another stitch-up. &quot;It looks like you've got me over a barrel
    on that one,&quot; she said. &quot;Unless of course all that ice cream should cause one of
    you to have an accident. Then we'd be even.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Jane. &quot;We might have decided to let you carry emergency
    things for us all, but we're never going to actually need them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;After all,&quot; said Hannah, &quot;we're all big girls now.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And big girls don't wet their knickers, I suppose?&quot; said Claire.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You've got it,&quot; said all three girls in unison.<br>
