    Characters: Emma, Eve <br>
    Location: Train Station<br>
    <br>
    -------------------------------------------- <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Won,&quot; Eve triumphed smiling, for the third time in a row. Emma looked surprised
    at empty checkerboard on the table between them and muttered: &quot;Just luck, nothing
    more! I bet you cannot win another time?&quot; Eve looked out the train window. &quot;Hey
    Emma, at what time will our train arrive?&quot; &quot;Do not worry,&quot; Emma said,
    &quot;it is still more than a half hour drive down to Marseilles, and we have plenty of
    time left.&quot; &quot;Ok well I agree, just one game, but that's also the last!&quot; Eve
    replied. &quot;And then I quickly go to the bathroom,&quot; she added in her mind, because
    they had a lot of drinks on board of the train, and she felt her bladder pushing against
    the elastic of her skirt, gently but slowly becoming more firm.<br>
    <br>
    Eve and Emma were two psychology students, just graduated, and they had decided the two of
    them would make a great trip across Europe by train. They had the entire route already
    mapped out for days, bought train tickets, hostels booked, everything to the last detail.
    In about 40 minutes they would arrive in Marseilles, where they would spend their first
    night. Their train was divided in separate compartments, and the girls had one compartment
    occupied. The atmosphere was excellent, and Emma brought a wide range of drinks with her,
    light alcoholic but not too heavy, so they could drink a lot without really getting drunk.
    The entire window side of the table was already filled with empty liquor bottles. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Déjà vu?&quot; Eve mocked, 5 minutes later, when she outwitted her for the fourth
    time with her last piece. &quot;Not funny,&quot; Emma muttered, but she could not suppress
    a sheepish smile. &quot;Ok, ok, I admit it, you're just better in this game,&quot; she
    added, &quot;a toast to the victor, and our big European trip!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Emma put her lips to the next bottle and gulped the liquor, and Eve followed her example.
    &quot;And now I gotta use the bathroom,&quot; Eve said to Emma then. &quot;Yeah, I could
    really use that too!&quot; Emma said clearly. &quot;Otherwise, you go first,&quot; Eve
    politely said. &quot;Well, if you need it so badly...&quot; Emma said, as politely as Eve
    did. &quot;No, no, not at all, you go first, I'll stay here to watch out for our
    stuff,&quot; Eve lied a bit. Eve did not have to say that twice, because Emma had to use
    the bathroom as much as she did! Emma closed the door behind her, and went in the
    direction of the nearest toilet, which could be found in the next coach. Now she was the
    only one walking on the aisle, and she couldn't help to notice how full her bladder really
    was. Unconsciously she accelerated her pace a little, towards the toilet. But when she
    arrived, the toilet was obviously occupied. &quot;Now that's just typical,&quot; she
    thought, not that these few seconds would matter, but still. She leaned against the wall,
    and stared through the nearby glass door, into the bar. Wow, did she see that for real?
    She moved closer to the door to take a better look. Oh yes, what a hottie behind the bar!
    Her heart melted. She glanced at the closed bathroom door, then back to the bar. The
    bartender was apparently alone, not really surprising, because it was already quite late
    now.<br>
    <br>
    There was a little twinkle in her eyes, as she glanced at the closed bathroom door for the
    last time. &quot;Oh what,&quot; she grinned, &quot;it's time to score...&quot; and she
    went to the bar. &quot;Sorry, we're closed,&quot; said the bartender with an obvious Dutch
    accent. Emma's heart pounded in her throat. And then he was Belgian too! That wasn't just
    luck, this was faith! &quot;Hey, you can also say it in the Dutch you know, Emma opened
    the conversation, laughing. The boy looked surprised. &quot;How did you...?&quot;
    &quot;Come on,&quot; Emma laughed, &quot;your English accent is even worse than the German
    of Jean-Marie Pfaff!&quot; The bartender was still looking very surprised at the girl that
    just entered his bar. &quot;Emma, it's nice to meet you,&quot; Emma said for herself.
    &quot;David,&quot; he replied. &quot;And if you really want to know, I'm from Bruges,
    although it remains a mystery to me, how you could guess that, with only hearing an
    English sentence by me.&quot; Emma grinned, and she broke the ice once again. &quot;Ah, I
    know a bit of human nature, and a bit of helpless English ... So, what can I drink from
    you, Mr. Bruges?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;My name is David and I was just about to close the bar, actually.&quot; David
    pointed to the opening hours on the door of the bar compartment. Emma looked very
    uninterested and replied: &quot;Come on, the bar is open until 1 and it is just...&quot;
    &quot;... Quarter past 1,&quot; David added, while he put some glasses in the cupboard.
    But Emma was not going to give up so fast. &quot;Please, a drink, that's all I ask for, I
    promise&quot; Emma begged. &quot;As a matter of fact, I'll buy you one!&quot; &quot;In
    that case... just one then!&quot; David laughed, &quot;But I must warn you, those drinks
    are pretty expensive here.&quot; Emma ignored that last remark. &quot;A whiskey-cola,
    please! Or no, make it two, suit yourself.&quot; Emma jumped on one of the bar stools, and
    she saw through the glass door, how the toilet door was open, and the lady who had
    occupied it walked away. She also wondered how Eve would be doing, but she thought to
    herself, &quot;Probably she would do it herself if she would have the chance. She will
    understand.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    She crossed her legs and looked into David's eyes. &quot;A lot of whiskey, a little bit of
    cola,&quot; Emma said while David poured both glasses. A bit of alcohol would loose their
    tongues; Emma knew from personal experience... <br>
    &quot;And what brings you here, all alone?&quot; She tried to start the conversation over
    again. &quot;He's not really a talkative guy, but damn hot&quot; Emma thought... <br>
    &quot;Well, I'm here with two friends, we are on our way to Geneva. My father, who works
    at the SNCB, has given me this holiday job so I am able to pay a part of my journey. So
    basically, I get a free ride to Geneva, and now earn some money, just for fun. And what's
    your story, also alone?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, my friend is in the train carriage next door, we are making a tour of Europe,
    and now we are heading to Marseilles.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;So your is girlfriend sitting there, all alone now?&quot; David looked doubtful. <br>
    Emma's smooth talking stopped for a second. She obviously didn't want it to be clear that
    she was just hitting on him. But as soon as she stopped talking, she had an answer ready.
    &quot;Well, the thing is, we were so stupid, and we didn't bring enough drinks for the
    trip, for the last five hours I've had nothing to drink, so I went to grab a drink while
    my girlfriend Eve is still with stuff...&quot; <br>
    David nodded and put the two glasses of whiskey-cola on the bar. &quot;Cheers to the
    holidays!&quot; Emma cheered, and she casually let her hand slide over to David's hand. <br>
    <br>
    It was very quiet in the compartment where Eve was, now that Emma was away. Eve didn't
    feel at ease, all alone. &quot;For how long has Emma been gone already? Not that long. A
    minute- or five?&quot; Eve searched trough her backpack to find her phone. &quot;22 past
    1.&quot; She bent down a little and put the phone back in her pocket. She nervously
    clenched her right leg together and she felt a bit of pain in her abdomen, caused by the
    bending. She pulled her sweater up a little, just to see how her belly was. She laid her
    right hand softly on her belly and rubbed her skin. She was staring at her belly button
    and rubbed in small circles around it. <br>
    A few moments later the silence was broken by an announcement.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Madames et messieurs, nous arriverons à Marseille dans approximent trente minutes.
    Ladies and gentlemen, we will arrive in Marseilles in about thirty minutes. Medammen und
    herren, wir sollen arriveren im Marseille im dreiBiz minuten.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Eve moaned softly and put both her hands on her belly. Her two hands slowly moved up and
    down with each breath, along with the movement of her belly. Still gazing at her belly,
    she was surprised that her belly could be so firm and round. She had never seen her lower
    body like that- she simply had to use the bathroom so much!<br>
    <br>
    Emma also had heard the announcement in the bar, though she was less pleased to hear the
    message. Just one half hour left to impress David, and the conversation was not going
    really smoothly yet. In addition to that, she got extra nervous from the signals she was
    constantly getting from her full bladder. But Emma was not going to give up so fast.
    &quot;What this conversation needs, is more alcohol,&quot; she thought. Challengingly, she
    drank her glass in one gulp, and then put it down on the bar. &quot;Well Mr. Bartender
    from Bruges, can't you keep up with my pace?&quot; She pointed to David's glass, which was
    still half full. &quot;Afraid of a little drink, or a girlfriend who is waiting for
    you?&quot; Emma squeezed her eyes a little closer, and winked to David. Emma began to
    chuckle. &quot;Just kidding, drink at your own pace, but... pour me a second one.&quot;
    Clearly intimidated by shameless words of Emma, David gave her another drink, and
    answered: &quot;No girlfriend who is waiting for me, sorry. And your boyfriend, what does
    he think of your alcoholic escapades?&quot; Emma couldn't suppress a small smile.
    &quot;Subtle, very subtle, mister,&quot; she said to herself. Emma replied, just as
    mysterious as untruthful. &quot;What he doesn't know- doesn't hurt, right?&quot; &quot;And
    that fact that I have no boyfriend for the moment, makes it much easier,&quot; she
    laughed. An even bigger smile came on her face. The first act of flirting... She quickly
    pushed her hand in her crotch, very softly, and continued the conversation.<br>
    <br>
    Eve, in the meanwhile, was still in the same position, with both hands on her bare belly,
    when someone who knocked at the door suddenly startled her. Quickly she pulled her shirt
    down, and the door slid open. &quot;Can I see your tickets, please?&quot; she heard a man
    in a very neatly ironed uniform speak. Shocked by her unexpected visitor, she felt the
    elastic of her skirt firmly pushing on her bladder again, and she pushed her buttocks
    together. &quot;Yes, off course,&quot; Eve said, very shy. She grabbed in Emma's bag,
    which was in the seat across her, and searched for the tickets. She was a little nervous
    in the presence of this unknown man, who was staring at her- especially now, as her need
    for a bathroom was really, really intense. She pushed her thighs and knees together, and
    gently wiggled from her one foot to the other one. She turned her head sideways, and saw
    the man, still staring at her body. Eve's face went red. She did not know where Emma kept
    the tickets in her bag- that was Emma's responsibility. &quot;Come on, where are those
    tickets...&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Eve couldn't help it at all but her and her full bladder were getting more nervous by the
    second. When she was just sitting, a few minutes ago, she actually forgot how urgently she
    needed a bathroom. But now, while she was searching for the tickets in stress, her need
    came back to her attention, twice as hard. To her joy, she saw the plastic bag with the
    two pieces of paper. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Eve exclaimed, maybe a little too loud, and her
    face went red even more. She sheepishly handed the tickets to the conductor. With a
    slightly beaten voice over she added: &quot;My other girlfriend went to the
    bathroom.&quot; &quot;Ok, thank you, enjoy your trip!&quot; The man closed the door behind
    him. <br>
    <br>
    Eve threw the tickets on the table and jumped right back into her seat, but clearly less
    at ease than before. &quot;What the hell is Emma doing?&quot; she wondered, as she rubbed
    her aching belly. She looked at her phone. Emma was almost away for like a quarter of an
    hour, she guessed. &quot;Come on Emma, I gotta pee so bad...,&quot; she hissed between her
    teeth, realizing that that wouldn't help at all. She could not leave all their precious
    stuff in a distant, unknown place like this.<br>
    <br>
    With the tips of her fingers she rubbed her bikini line, and the part squeezed between her
    legs already felt very damp. Luckily it was just sweat. It was also very hot in there.
    Warmer by the minute, it seemed. All the effort she had to make, to keep her pee inside
    her, made her sweat like a pig. She looked at the little piece of visible skin between her
    skirt and her top. If her adult willpower didn't stop her, she would have just done it
    here, in her pants. And where the heck was Emma? In about fifteen minutes they would
    arrive in Marseilles! There was no way that Eve could hold on for so long. She tried to
    think clearly. Couldn't she urinate somewhere here, in this compartment? She looked
    around, but couldn't see an obvious solution. So there was no other alternative than to
    sit here, and try to hold her pee for another little while... <br>
    <br>
    But how long was &quot;another little while?&quot; Some shadows occasionally appeared in
    the hallway, people must have been walking back and forth, but she couldn't see Emma
    anywhere. &quot;Try to think of something else, Eve,&quot; she said to herself, to give
    herself a little more courage. But not matter how hard she tried, her bladder was
    screaming for attention so much; Eve's poor brains couldn't think of nothing else. Still
    sitting down, she softly pushed the door of their compartment, and threw a quick glance at
    the hallway. &quot;Emma?&quot; she tried softly. But there was nothing to see in the dark.
    &quot;Emma?&quot; she tried again, a little more desperate. Eve moaned softly, and closed
    the door again. Just to be sure, she slipped her hand in her underpants, which were
    getting very sweaty. Her arm was placed on her abdomen. Eve's breath's was getting heavier
    by the minute. As the elastic of her skirt wasn't pushing on her belly anymore, she felt
    more comfortable, and she kept her hand under the elastic and into her panties.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, this effect already faded out after just a few moments, and Eve had to go
    pee as much as she did before. She began to breathe faster once again, and desperately
    searched for a way out. Maybe she had a jar that she could pee in? But beyond the empty
    bottles on the table, she couldn't see anything. She moaned once again, her fingers firmly
    pushed against her labia. Or maybe she could put a towel under her and pee on it? But that
    would make such a mess. Desperate, she looked around further. Or maybe she could try to
    pee out of the window? But she realized that the small window made urinating impossible,
    and she also rejected that plan. All her hope lay with Emma...<br>
    <br>
    But Emma was still sitting in the bar, drinking her whiskey-cola calmly. Although, calmly?
    Her bladder was more than full in the meanwhile. It was already full when she was in the
    compartment with Eve actually, and that extra half hour plus two full glasses of
    whiskey-cola had not improved her condition.<br>
    <br>
    But Emma wasn't prepared to just let her catch go; her flirting needs were bigger than her
    physical needs. Still staring into David's eyes, and sipping her last drop of
    whiskey-cola, she sat behind the counter, bouncing up and down on her barstool, without
    David noticing of course. Her left hand had disappeared already minutes ago, under the
    counter. And occasionally- more frequently as time progressed; she pushed it firmly
    between her legs. David poured his third whiskey-cola, and Emma had to suppress a grin.
    &quot;Every time, it works every time,&quot; she thought triumphantly. If there was one
    thing that a man couldn't stand, it was a woman who drank more alcohol than he did. <br>
    <br>
    Emma's master plan was again a success, because the alcohol had loosened their tongues a
    lot. Shy David was talking about the sunny destination where he would go with his friends,
    and what they would do on their journey. Emma was a little quieter for the last several
    minutes, because the signals her bladder was sending were getting painful. She tried to
    focus on David's story, but the one thing that she was really focused on, and was
    constantly in her thoughts, was the little voice that told her that she needed a bathroom
    RIGHT NOW. <br>
    <br>
    She quickly drank the last drop from her glass and put it on the counter. She wanted to
    tell David that she had to go to the toilet, but she was too ashamed to do that.
    Especially considering he was a boy she'd only just met. So all she could do was make a
    single cough. She just could not tell David that she had to go to the bathroom! She felt
    like a little girl.<br>
    <br>
    While she remained silent, she tried to listen to David's story again, and she pushed her
    clammy hand in the crotch of her pants. &quot;Come on... you must tell him, Emma,&quot;
    she was thinking. She began to sweat more and more. Oh, oh, she had to pee so bad... But
    no, she couldn't say anything, not in the presence of such a hottie. What if he got the
    impression, that she was a still little girl who couldn't hold her pee? But Emma finally
    collapsed under the pressure. <br>
    <br>
    While David was still talking, she suddenly blurted out: &quot;... I have to go to the
    toilet.&quot; Emma stammered. Shocked by her own weak tone, she recovered and said;
    &quot;Before we start a final round.&quot; She was about to jump off her bar stool, and
    she was ready to run like the wind towards the toilets, when David replied: &quot;Well, if
    you go to the toilet, I'm going to sleep, it is incredibly late, and I need to get up
    tomorrow morning to serve coffee. &quot; He dimmed the lights above the bar, to make it
    look real. For the very first time this evening, Emma felt very uncertain. He was just
    giving her a goodbye like that, without giving her a kiss or his telephone number? <br>
    <br>
    But at the other hand she had to pee so terribly. &quot;I'll come back, promise,&quot;
    Emma tried, but David answered, &quot;Come on, can't you hold on a little longer? We will
    arrive in Marseilles soon, and...&quot; David leaned forward. &quot;And?&quot; Emma asked,
    intrigued. &quot;... And I still haven't got your phone number,&quot; David said. &quot;Or
    don't you want to give it to me?&quot; David had no idea how close Emma was to soaking her
    panties, and he thought that Emma's remark was an excuse for her to leave.<br>
    <br>
    Now Emma's dilemma was really complete. He wanted her! Obviously. How could she leave now?
    She couldn't! That would sound like a rejection, and that was the last thing Emma wanted.
    &quot;One last round,&quot; she said after a little hesitation, as she tried to smile.
    Inside of her, she felt her bladder protesting violently. She watched how David poured her
    glass once again, and laid her right hand on David's hand. Her other hand was pressed
    between her two legs...<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Shit, shit, shit, Emma!&quot; Eve shouted now desperately in the compartment. Only
    ten minutes until they arrived, and Emma was already gone for like a half hour! Eve had to
    abandon hope that Emma would come back. In the meanwhile, she had to pee so badly that her
    bladder could explode any second now, despite all the effort she had put into holding her
    pee. &quot;Shit, shit!&quot; She cried out once again with tears in her eyes. She now had
    her panties pulled down to her knees, so she could press her hand directly on her lips.
    With her bare buttocks she was sweating on the soft fabric of the chair. She cried out
    once again, a little quieter this time. Trembling with adrenaline, she pushed her hand
    firmly against her bare crotch over and over again, moving faster and faster. She almost
    couldn't control her bladder anymore, all she could now do was pee, pee like a racehorse.
    Something that she wanted to avoid, no matter what, but she just didn't know how. <br>
    <br>
    Emma would definitely pee her chair and her panties, if she had to stay here. There was
    only one thing to do. For a second or two she tried to calm down, straining every muscle
    in her body, and with a loud groan she jumped out of her chair. She used her last little
    bit of strength, trying to keep to keep the puddle inside her, as she ran straight to the
    toilet, as fast as she could. She sprinted out of her compartment, with her panties still
    down around her thighs, and her hand still holding her crotch. With her private parts
    completely visible, she ran towards the toilet. <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately for her, there was nobody in the hallway at this particular moment. Slowly but
    surely, she felt her control slipping away. With every step she took, she came closer to
    the blue illuminated toilet sign in the hallway. She was almost there. It seemed like an
    eternity. She felt her fingers getting wet, and a trickle running down her legs. <br>
    <br>
    The first big drops hit her palm when she was at the toilet door. In a haze, she pulled
    her hand away from her crotch, and immediately she saw how a small trickle became a huge
    yellow waterfall. One second after she pulled her hand away, the stream was splashing on
    the floor. While peeing she saw the glowing toilet bowl, and she quickly bent over to sit
    on the thing. She smacked against the bowl with her buttocks. She sat on the bowl with her
    face to the sink, and she tried to spread her legs as much as she could, because she still
    had her pink panties hanging down around her knees. She relaxed and even more pee came out
    of her aching body. Only a part of it actually landed in the bowl, and she felt the
    biggest part of her pee splashing on her feet, or running along her spread legs. Soon she
    was standing in a puddle, sobbing, humiliated, but also a little relieved. Her pee went
    merrily into all directions, and slowly the heavy stream began to fade out. Eve could now
    aim her pee in the toilet bowl with her fingers, which were already wet with pee anyway. <br>
    <br>
    Without stopping, still with a strong clean stream, Eve emptied her bladder, and after her
    bladder was entirely empty, she stopped her pee exactly the same way, without shocks or
    aftershocks. She looked around her, and surveyed the damage. Her feet were all wet and her
    panties couldn't be more soaked, but her skirt was still amazingly dry. She took a lot of
    toilet paper and closed the door, which was still open. With the toilet paper she dried
    her body first, and then she tried to clean the floor, so no one would see her accident.
    She pulled her wet panties back up, and the soaked textile piece was almost glued to her
    crotch and abdomen. Slowly she opened the door, and saw how the carpet in the corridor was
    also a little wet. She was so ashamed but she could not dry the splashes on the carpet
    anyway, so she went back to her compartment. Only 5 minutes left until they arrived, so
    she'd better start cleaning up. Without bothering to dress properly, she put all bottles
    and other things silently in their bags. <br>
    <br>
    In the meanwhile, Emma's glass was still standing on the bar. Emma's body was screaming
    out in pain, but she could hide that pretty well on the outside. The flirting game with
    David had now almost reached its peak, and Emma had David's telephone number written on a
    piece of paper, which was on the bar. Emma and David looked each other in the eye, while
    Emma was playing a game with her willpower, trying to hold on with her hand. She didn't
    dare to slide her hand into her pants, what if David saw it? But she hadn't released her
    hand from the crotch of her pants, for five minutes. <br>
    <br>
    She heavily wiggled her buttocks on her stool, from front to back; it was really hard to
    imagine that David did not notice. Her upper body was also moving, somewhat less
    strikingly, but also moving back and forth pretty constantly. But the vibration in Emma's
    body language actually just looked cute and sexy. Emma end David didn't realize that the
    train was slowing down and they were almost in Marseilles. <br>
    <br>
    There was a small silence. David looked Emma in the eyes, and gave her a naughty look, and
    before she knew it, David leaned forward over the bar, and pressed his lips against those
    of Emma. Emma's heartbeat stopped, and David leaned back again. After which Emma,
    forgetting her pee for a few seconds, leaned forward herself and pressed her lips to his.
    In a sort of trance Emma's lips played a game with David's lips, but after a few seconds
    of glory, Emma went back to reality, and felt how her bladder was compressing while she
    was bent over. <br>
    <br>
    She wanted to cry, let her pee flow, but somehow, because of the energy boost that flew
    through her body; she managed to keep her pee inside her bladder. She pushed her hand
    between her legs with all of her force, and she could not suppress a groan of pain. But
    fortunately David thought that she was expressing her feelings of ecstasy, a reaction to
    his kiss. <br>
    <br>
    Emma leaned back and tried to sit normal again, moaning again yet another time. David got
    a twinkle in his eyes and thought, &quot;Wow, this girl is very hot!&quot; Emma, on the
    contrary, had the tears in her eyes, but tried to sit still nonetheless- after that
    fantastic kiss she could not possibly run away! She recrossed her legs, hoping that it
    would make holding easier, but on the contrary, the pain in her abdomen was getting worse,
    while David remained staring into her eyes. <br>
    <br>
    Quickly she crossed her legs again, and pushed her fingers firmly against her crotch,
    somewhere in the neighborhood of her pee hole. She pushed, pushed, and shoved her fingers
    in her crotch even harder, so hard it almost hurt. For a few seconds she regained control,
    but then the pain came back in waves, and no matter how hard she tried, something in her
    forced her to pee, and her bladder failed under the immense pressure. She felt a tiny,
    tiny amount of fluid escaping from her bladder, but she pushed her hand against her pee
    hole so hard, that nothing could escape. But it felt so immensely painful, Emma could
    start crying, and she slowly began to lose control of her upper body. <br>
    <br>
    Trembling, she felt the grip around her crotch gently relax, just enough for the pool in
    Emma's body, to drain away. She moaned once again and felt a trickle of pee slowly running
    into her panties. She pushed second her hand between her legs, and felt her panties, and
    then her shorts getting wet. But thank God, her bladder regained control, so that Emma
    hadn't soaked her pants entirely; the wet patch on her shorts was not that big yet. She
    needed a bathroom like never before, and wondered whether she could walk out of the bar
    without David realizing what she was doing. Although she had never been to this point
    before in her life, not even close, she wasn't used to having to urinate so badly, but she
    told herself that she just could not pee in her pants, she was mature, she had to tolerate
    this. But her stomach was in so much pain, all she wanted was to get the pee outside of
    her bladder, she wanted the pain to stop. <br>
    <br>
    But with her last remaining scrap of willpower, she held it in one way or another. Her
    eyes went from the toilet door, to the paper with David's phone number that lay on the
    bar, and in one motion she grabbed the paper just as David said: &quot;We have
    arrived!&quot; She quickly gazed outside, and saw that the train was standing still, and
    had been for a short while, because passengers were already leaving in the escalators, on
    the platform. Emma jumped, with her hand tightly holding her pee hole and sprinted, to the
    outside. When she was outside the bar, she heard a whistle from the conductor, the signal
    that the train was leaving again. Emma quickly jumped between the closing doors, and
    landed on the platform, where she saw Eve, with all their bags. &quot;Emma, where have
    you...?&quot; tried Eve, but Emma shouted triumphantly:&quot; Telephone number!
    Hottie!&quot; while she was waving with the paper in her hand. But despite her victory,
    she still had to use the bathroom, unbelievable urgently. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Emma!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I gotta pee!&quot; With a last attempt, she tried
    to find a toilet on the platform, and she saw an arrow hanging over the escalators
    pointing to the sanitary facilities, and tried to run that way. But without immediately
    realizing it, almost immune from all the pain she had already had to endure, her bladder
    was happily relaxing, and she felt a large pee stream running straight into her pants.
    Realizing that there was nothing more she could do, she stopped walking and pulled her
    pants down in one smooth motion, in the middle of the platform. She already had unbuttoned
    her pants before, and her pants slid down like butter to her feet. Eve was watching this
    spectacle with eyes wide open, and an open mouth- only to see how an immense yellow beam
    landing on the ground between her legs, making a loud splattering sound. Eve saw that Emma
    closed her eyes and clearly enjoyed the moment, while some passengers, who where still
    waiting on the platform, stared at the peeing girl.<br>
    <br>
    Emma, however, couldn't care less. She slowly opened her eyes, and started laughing with
    joy when she saw the yellow stream running out of her body, through her sore labia. The
    large puddle flew, along with the slope of the platform, down on to the tracks, and Emma
    started to wiggle her ass back and forth when she was done peeing. Her shoes and the rest
    of her legs had remained dry, only her panties and shorts had a big soaking spot on them,
    and compared to the power of Emma's pee, that wasn't even so bad either.<br>
    <br>
    Emma pulled her pants up again, looked at Eve and said, as if nothing had happened:
    &quot;Come on Eve, are we leaving?&quot; She picked the paper with David's number up from
    the ground, and hopped over to Eve. Eve said, with a sad looking face: &quot;I've also
    done it in my pants...&quot; They looked at each other, and all Emma and Eve could do, was
    laugh. Was this an eventful beginning to an eventful journey? <br>
