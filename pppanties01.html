    I haven't sent a story before, so I don't know if this is ok for your use or not, but it's
    just a short desperation story. This is about desperation I had witnessed. It was
    funny/cute, classic and innocent...so I thought the desperation fans here would appreciate
    this story.<br>
    <br>
    This occurred today in my office. I will preface this right now with I KNOW this woman
    wasn't testing me for a reaction. She was just comfortable and not the type to be
    embarrassed in a situation like this... just me and no one else around. Of course I'm not
    using real names. To set it up... there's a young, cute, woman (Linda) who works down the
    hall from me in another department. She also has a sister who works for the same company
    at the far end of the same hallway. They have a younger sister who had one of those
    kitchen parties about 3 weeks ago. It was cookware, baking stuff, utensils, etc. I had
    ordered some stuff, and the sister in the mailroom (Josie) had had my order in her car for
    a few days...forgetting to bring it in.<br>
    <br>
    Linda barged into my office and started to use my co-worker's phone to make a call
    (co-worker wasn't in). I asked her who she was calling...she said &quot;you'll see.&quot;
    Then she starts squirming...and said, &quot;Damn, I have to pee sooo bad.&quot; She's
    bouncing, wriggling and changing feet the whole time she's on the phone... doing the
    pee-pee dance... begging her sister to PLEASE answer the damn phone. I highly doubt Linda
    purposely pushes her bladder to the limit, but she certainly wasn't hiding the fact she
    had to pee. Josie finally answered the phone and told her that she had already delivered
    my items. The big bag was sitting on a table as you walk in the door.<br>
    <br>
    She had to pee so bad she couldn't see straight apparently. LOL Seriously...no way she
    could have missed that, but for some reason she felt compelled to call her sister right
    then, instead of going to the restroom first. She probably remembered the order, as she
    was about to walk by my office on her way to the rest room, and figured she might forget
    if she didn't do it right away while she was thinking of it.<br>
    <br>
    So she gets off the phone, crosses her legs, bends slightly at the knees, squeezes her
    legs tight together and bends forward slightly. I swear- I'd have been willing to bet that
    she was only a few milliseconds away from jamming her hand between her legs! She moaned
    quietly, but out loud and said again... &quot;Ohhhh God, I gotta pee!!&quot; She very
    slowly attempted to straighten up and headed for the rest room. When she walked out of the
    office, she definitely wasn't standing tall! I don't imagine she could have managed to
    hold it much longer. No question here...aside from her saying more than once that she had
    to pee, her symptoms were those of classic desperation.<br>
    <br>
    I've been in that situation many times, only intentionally waiting almost a little too
    long... so I KNOW that hand was sooo close to being in an embarrassing place... well
    embarrassing when it's in the office. And I know the feeling all too well. Relief is just
    before you as you're about to open that stall door. I have no doubt there was a struggle
    getting the pants and panties down once in the stall.<br>
    <br>
    And I'd bet ANYTHING... that her panties weren't completely dry when all was said and
    done. Any takers?<br>
    <br>
    OK...that's my story. Hope you enjoyed. It wasn't me, but after all that, if it HAD been
    me, I sure can imagine what I would have been doing in the privacy of that rest room
    stall.<br>
