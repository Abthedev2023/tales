    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>It was Wednesday afternoon at St. Peter's Hospital.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Operating theatre sister Fiona Jones was arranging
    schedules in her office when Mr. Redman, the senior Neuro-surgeon, who said he wanted to
    talk about a delicate matter, interrupted her. &quot;Next Monday,&quot; he began, &quot;I
    am to try out a new type of transplant operation which will bring a great deal of money to
    the hospital if it is successful. It will go on for a long time, although I cannot be sure
    how long but it will certainly be much longer than anything we are doing at the moment. We
    are getting into a completely unknown area and I have been thinking about ways to guard
    against anything going wrong. One of the precautions I want to take against nurses needing
    to leave the theatre before the end is to use only nurses with exceptionally large
    bladders, and I have to ask you whether St. Peter's can provide them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Fiona had never had this request before and was at first offended.
    &quot;There have never been any problems at this hospital with nurses being unable to last
    through operations.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said, &quot;It
    is a matter of pride amongst the staff that they have built up their endurance to meet all
    the demands placed upon them.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;True&quot;
    replied Mr. Redman &quot;but we are getting into a completely new ball game here and have
    to think how we will cope with an ultra long operation.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fiona was still put out but she had the presence
    of mind to ask him how big the team would be. Mr. Redman replied that there would be him,
    a registrar acting as junior surgeon, an anesthetist, two senior theatre nurses and one
    junior. Fiona asked who the anesthetist was to be and was told that it was likely to be
    Audrey Fairweather.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;A bad choice if you
    are looking for good bladder control&quot; said Fiona; &quot;you will find that Ruth
    Powell may be new to St. Peter's, but she has already shown that her bladder gives her far
    greater endurance than poor old Audrey. The nurses are no problem,&quot; continued Fiona,
    &quot;I will be one of the seniors because quite frankly you will not find anyone better
    equipped than I am to meet a challenge like this. Mary Robinson will be the other senior
    and Helen McCarthy the junior because I know them both to be very well able to meet your
    requirements.&quot; Fiona bore in mind that Helen had by far the best bladder control
    among the young nurses and needed a toilet very infrequently whatever the circumstances.
    What Fiona also knew well was that she and Mary went back many years to when they were
    both students together and both had really big bladders even then, with Mary's the biggest
    amongst the student nurses. But that situation did not please Fiona who was competitive in
    all things and had never met anyone who needed the ladies' less often than she did. She
    determined to overtake Mary and so started holding on till she was bursting and then
    holding on some more, and by constantly doing pelvic floor exercises gradually built up
    her capacity over a long period until it was even larger than Mary's. When Mary realized
    that she had been overtaken she started on the same regime and although she gradually
    built up a superbly trained bladder, capable of really heroic feats of endurance, it was
    never quite a match for Fiona's. Sometimes the two of them spent the evening in the bar of
    the St Peter's Social Club each drinking pint after pint after pint of shandy with the
    purpose of confirming to anyone drinking with them (and to each other) just what a large
    volume of liquid they could get down their throats before they could not postpone a trip
    to the ladies a moment longer. Four times out of five it was Mary who had to go first, but
    whichever of them it was would be occupying a cubicle for a very long time while her
    swollen bladder steadily discharged its contents. It was a point of pride for both Mary
    and Fiona that neither of them would get up during the night and Mary's husband Colin
    always loved it when Mary had spent the evening drinking because hearing Mary's early
    morning piss splashing endlessly into the en suite toilet was an unfailing turn on for
    him. In turn his rampant desire and iron hard erection guaranteed some super sex for Mary.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The following Monday dawned bright
    and clear and the surgical team began assembling ready for an 8 a.m. start. There was
    Fiona who was 38, red haired, tall and skinny with small breasts and Mary also 38 of
    average height but a little overweight and with black hair. Then there was Helen the third
    nurse who was 24 and had a really bubbly outgoing personality and finally Ruth the
    anesthetist who was the oldest of them at 48 and the shortest at 5ft 3inches. The
    registrar who was to be assistant surgeon was Jane Frodsham, who was tall and auburn and
    brainy, and at 31 was said to be a rising star at St Peters'.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane knew from bitter experience that long
    operations really tested her bladder endurance, so she had drunk very little over the
    preceding 24 hours. She heard Fiona say to Mary and Helen &quot;This will be a long one
    and we won't have a chance for anything to drink till it's over. I hope you remembered
    that at breakfast time and took extra liquid on board to guard against dehydration.&quot;
    They both nodded and Ruth said &quot;Me as well.&quot; Jane was astounded and thought to
    herself &quot;But if I did that I wouldn't last three hours.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The transplant got under way and
    went well at first. Then Dr. Redman hit the first of a series of difficulties and progress
    slowed right down. He and Jane were working as fast as they could, but as soon as they
    overcame one problem another appeared. Time was going on and they were dropping further
    and further behind their schedule. It was nearly 3pm. before they could say to the others
    &quot;It's going better now. We could be finished in an hour.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jane was really pleased that the end was in sight
    because she had been getting increasing pain from her bladder for some time, and her
    situation was now desperate. Steadily she worked on, having to concentrate hard not to
    think about her overloaded bladder but sure that she could hold out for the short time
    till they were finished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But then there was a
    flash of activity. Something was badly wrong; Dr. Redman was shouting to the nurses to
    give him more clamps and quickly. A long and messy repair had to be carried out and the
    only way Jane was able to get through was because she was so busy; she did not have a
    moment to think about the torment her bladder was in.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">By now it was 5:30 and Jane was far
    from alone in struggling with her need for a toilet. Over the last couple of hours all the
    other women in the theatre had been aware of an increasing need, gradually passing into an
    overwhelming need to urinate. Fiona looked round with concern thinking that if her own
    splendid bladder had become so painful, what must the others be like? Fortunately the
    problems that had surfaced in the afternoon had all been overcome and the operation was
    moving into its last stages and the final sewing up of the incision could be made. Each of
    the girls could recognize in the others tell tale signs that they were all in the same
    boat; fidgeting although trying not to show it, gritting their teeth or biting their lips
    so as to distract themselves from the agonizing pain of their bladders, which was getting
    worse and worse. Mary noticed Fiona crossing her legs as she stood at the instrument table
    and thought to herself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Bet that's the
    effect of that pint tea mug she uses at breakfast.&quot; The one thing that got them
    through was the determination not to be the first to let Dr. Redman down and somehow each
    of them ignored the overwhelming need to empty their massively distended bladders until
    the sewing up was complete and at 6:40pm Dr. Redman said, &quot;That's it. Thank you very
    much. We are finished at last.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The nearest ladies toilet was only
    just down the corridor from the operating theatre, and they rushed to it. Jane found she
    was jostling Helen in an attempt to get there that little bit faster but in a moment they
    were all inside. Ruth was last because she had to take small steps to avoid wetting
    herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This toilet had six cubicles so
    there was plenty of room for all of them (and one spare). Jane was first in getting into a
    cubicle, snatched down her trousers and pants in one movement, sat down and at last could
    relax that sphincter muscle that had been under such pressure for so long. A strong stream
    poured out of her and jetted against the inside of the toilet bowl to the accompaniment of
    her usual loud hiss. Within seconds Jane heard another hiss on her left hand side. Jane
    was elated that she had not disgraced herself and had held out even though she had been in
    such pain and thought to herself that the loudness of her hiss just showed what pressure
    she had held back. But while the noise she was making remained constant the hiss from her
    left was steadily increasing in loudness and intensity, reaching a level of urgency and
    insistence that showed that whoever was producing it was sending a great gushing torrent
    of piss jetting against the toilet bowl. Jane continued relieving herself with her own
    sound being almost drowned out by the mega decibels coming from her left which continued
    on loudly and steadily thirty seconds from when she started. Jane's hissing stopped and
    for a few more seconds she finished off with a decreasing stream; which splashed straight
    into the water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wiped herself and flushed
    the toilet and came out to wash her hands and all the time the noise of the furious
    cascade of piss continued, only tailing off and turning into a dribble as Jane was drying
    her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The toilet flushed, the door of
    the cubicle opened and young nurse Helen appeared. &quot;Oh how I needed that,&quot; she
    said. &quot;I felt as though my bladder was the size of a football.&quot; She quickly
    washed and dried her hands and asked Jane &quot;Coming?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;No I'll wait for the others,&quot; replied
    Jane who had been amazed by Helen's tremendous bladder capacity and a part of her just had
    to find out if Helen was unique, or whether Fiona, Ruth, or Mary could possibly match her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">These three had started relieving
    themselves at virtually the same moment as Helen and Jane, each of the three of them
    releasing a strong steady stream to splash down into the water in the toilet bowl. Jane
    had been aware of this in the background all the time and so knew that they had already
    been pissing for a long time. She was now was able to concentrate on the regular gushing
    coming from behind the three closed doors as the three women continued to ease the
    pressure on their grossly overfull bladders. All Jane could hear was the three uniform
    streams splashing and splashing and splashing continuously down into the water in the
    lavatory pans. Jane's reaction was a mixture of amazement that the three of them had not
    yet emptied their bladders completely after all this time, and envy about the colossal
    capacity they were displaying. The even flow went on and on and on cascading into the
    toilet bowls without any sign of tailing off and Jane began to realize that she was
    hearing bladders every bit as large as Helen's and probably even exceeding her immense
    size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The noise of their interminable
    cascades of piss echoed round and round the bare walls of the ladies, swelling the level
    of sound so that it was hard to believe that there were just three of them.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only when it seemed that the unwavering streams
    were to go on forever did Jane hear one taper off and die away. A toilet flushed and then
    she was joined by Ruth who was so pleased with herself that her trusty bladder had enabled
    her to last the course and survive her ordeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    Ruth washed her hands she turned to Jane and said &quot;I thought that I had an
    exceptional bladder, and it was more painful than it has ever been before and yet those
    two are leaving me way behind.&quot; They waited for Mary and Fiona, believing that they
    must finish at any moment, but could hear that they were both still pissing as strongly as
    ever, their regular streams going on splashing into the toilets as steadily as when they
    started over two minutes ago. It was forty seconds from when Ruth finished before Mary
    slowed to a trickle and stopped, leaving Fiona alone continuing to urinate. Then suddenly
    she stopped as well, but only for a moment before starting up again not quite as strongly
    as before for another 20 seconds and then ending with a series of squirts of decreasing
    length as she contracted her bladder muscles to squeeze out the last remaining contents.
    When she emerged from her cubicle she said, &quot;The things we do for this hospital. We
    have all been in agony for hours and all we will get for it is a thank you.&quot; Mary
    replied &quot;Yes, and no one else but us could have done it. No one else can exercise
    bladder control the way we do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A few minutes later Jane was walking
    across to the car park with Dr. Redman and telling him something of the heroic bladder
    exploits of the other women. &quot;I could never match them,&quot; complained Jane
    &quot;Their capacity is in a completely different league to mine. I only lasted out
    because I had drunk so little over the last 24 hours.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;Let me tell you something Jane,&quot; said Dr. Redman.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I prescribed myself a diuretic which I took
    yesterday evening. It had the desired effect and I peed continually then, leaving very
    little for today. It was the only way I could be sure of coping. You did very well, I
    never saw your concentration waver, and Fiona carefully chose the others because of their
    phenomenal bladder control. From what I have heard their bladders are unmatched in this
    hospital.&quot; &quot;Unmatched in any hospital in the land I'd say&quot; replied Jane
    (Unless, gentle reader, you know otherwise.)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
