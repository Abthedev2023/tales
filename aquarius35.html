    <br>
    Lena put her bag down on the bench and looked around. It was her first time in this gym,
    but she would probably find her way around easily. After her divorce she had decided to
    start anew in a number of ways. She was thirty-two, with a very feminine, rounded body and
    wavy, unruly blonde hair often worn in a ragged ponytail. She looked great in tight Levi's
    and anything that revealed her cleavage. Pity the sad bastard of a husband didn't
    appreciate her shapes. She removed her pink halter-top and her black lace bra, needing the
    sports variety under the Lycra top to support her while exercising. She slipped out of her
    jeans - no, she had to wriggle - and put her black jazz pants on. With her towel around
    her shoulders she headed for the exercise area.<br>
    <br>
    That had felt good. She stood in the shower, letting the hot water soak her hair and body.
    Looking around her she judged it safe to open her sluices, letting the hot pee flow from
    her bush and down her legs. She had to draw her breath as the girl entered the shower
    room- both from the fear that she had been caught peeing as well as from seeing the
    stunning beauty before her. About twenty, with short black hair, small, round breasts, a
    narrow waist, shaped hips, and long legs- and not a single hair on her body. Lena had
    heard talk of the increasing number of girls and women who chose to remove all their pubic
    hair, but she had never actually seen it. And she had never imagined the sight would
    excite her so much. She smiled weakly at the girl and began washing her hair. When she
    could she glanced at her, the smooth body moving as she washed herself. Eventually she had
    to stop rinsing her hair and fetch her towel. At the bench she positioned herself so as to
    be able to watch the girl as she dressed: A tiny blue thong, blue leggings, a long but
    tight yellow t-shirt or mini dress that barely covered her buttocks. A black belt
    accentuated her narrow waist. She put her things in a small rucksack and left with Lena's
    eyes glued to her bottom. Lena let her breath out. Distractedly she put her clothes on
    while contemplating her sexual preferences. Right now, she'd do anything to get this girl
    to bed. There had been experiences in her past with a couple of girlfriends, at least some
    real kissing and careful stroking of panty clad mounds, but this girl was so sexy she
    wanted her in full. Well, it seemed she would have to work out again, very soon.<br>
    <br>
    The next time she came a little earlier, lingering in the dressing room to see if the girl
    turned up. And she did. Wearing a miniature denim skirt and a t-shirt exposing her belly
    she slipped the sack from her shoulders and smiled at Lena. Lena unbuttoned her jeans and
    pulled them off, leaving her smallest pair of panties on. She wondered if the girl
    noticed. She put on her workout clothes and decided to find a spot where she could watch
    the room. The bikes seemed a good choice. The girl wore black leggings and a top that
    barely covered her breasts. She walked over to a bench where she lay on her back to lift
    weights. Her feet pointed at Lena, who felt her eyes drawn to the protruding mound and
    visible labia. Lena completed her round with a minimum of effort, staying as close to the
    girl as she could. Finally it was time to shower. The girl undressed, picked up her soap
    and walked to the stalls. Lena slipped her jazz pants off, pulled her top over her head,
    slipped out of her bra, and, finally, stepped out of her panties. Nobody stared. But she
    had to take a deep breath before she approached the shower. She saw the girl's eyes widen,
    and then a smile spread on her face. Lena smiled back, straightened up and stepped under
    the head next to the girl. Inside she was shaking. Here she was, with her pussy shaven,
    next to the girl she most of all wanted to show it to. The thought made her knees weak and
    she nearly peed herself. She curled her legs and held back, then thought why not, and with
    her legs clenched she let go, feeling the heat down the back of her thighs. She wondered
    if the girl could see the yellowing of the water, but dared not look down. The girl washed
    her hair, then her body, and Lena kept her eyes on her- the slender waist, the small
    buttocks, the long legs, the occasional glimpse of the smooth mons and the inviting fold
    between her legs. Lena had to keep herself from washing too eagerly between her own
    thighs. Bodies clean, Lena's thoughts dirty, they towelled, brushed and dressed. Lena
    didn't bother changing her panties, as she knew she'd stain them immediately. She closed
    her sack. Then she lifted her head and their eyes met. She couldn't help it; she squirted.
    The girl looked at her with serious eyes. -Come, she said.<br>
    <br>
    They walked, side by side, wordlessly. Lena felt her body move, her soft breasts heave,
    and her thighs rub. Beside her the slender girl moved with purpose, her short skirt
    hugging her hips. They turned the corner, and the girl unlocked a red Toyota, motioning to
    Lena to get in. Lena sat, thighs clenched, discreetly watching the long legs beside her
    move. She had to pee again. The girl pulled up in front of a block of flats, but instead
    of heading for the door, she brought Lena to a café on the corner. She bought large
    coffees and bottles of water for both, and they sat facing each other at a small table in
    the corner. She took Lena's hand. -You were watching me, she said.<br>
    <br>
    Lena bit her lip. -I just - I think you're beautiful. But I don't - I mean, I'm not a
    lesbian or anything, I -<br>
    <br>
    The girl put her finger on Lena's lips. -But you want me, don't you?<br>
    <br>
    Lena nodded. -I almost wet my pants when you looked at me.<br>
    <br>
    The girl smiled. -That's a good sign. Actually I'm so excited right now I've got trouble
    holding it. That would be a sight, losing it on the floor?<br>
    <br>
    Lena pictured the stream flowing from between the girl's legs and had to clench her legs.
    She drank more water.<br>
    <br>
    -But I'll wait. It's always better when I wait. How about you?<br>
    <br>
    -I need the bathroom soon, Lena admitted.<br>
    <br>
    -Please wait. Would you like anything else to drink?<br>
    <br>
    -Cider would be fine.<br>
    <br>
    The girl rose, and before she headed for the counter she put one hand between her legs and
    curtsied, winking at Lena. While waiting for the drinks she rocked on her feet, one leg
    behind the other. She brought the bottles to the table, waited for a second, then bent
    forward and kissed Lena on the mouth before sitting down.<br>
    <br>
    Lena swallowed, her eyes wide. -I'm dribbling. If you kiss me again I will burst.<br>
    <br>
    -Hold on. Drink up, girl. I can't wait to cuddle those boobs. Have you ever had a girl
    lick you?<br>
    <br>
    Lena shook her head and clenched her legs. -If you tried that now, you would be drenched.<br>
    <br>
    -Who says I don't want to be? I've wanted to see you pee since the first time I saw you.<br>
    <br>
    -Well, I peed in the shower right then. And I think you'll see me pee very soon now,
    whether I want to or not. I've never been this full.<br>
    <br>
    Lena's legs were shaking, she was wriggling on her chair and her bladder was rock hard
    under her hand. -I'm about to soak my jeans, and I don't even know your name.<br>
    <br>
    -I'm Pia. Suits me, doesn't it? And yours?<br>
    <br>
    -Lena.<br>
    <br>
    Pia leaned over and kissed Lena on the mouth. -Happy to meet you. How is your bladder?<br>
    <br>
    -Leaking, Lena said truthfully, her eyes moist and her hands in a vice grip by her thighs.<br>
    <br>
    -I'm almost bursting, too. Let's go.<br>
    <br>
    They rose, with difficulty. Lena had given up decency and was holding with both hands,
    legs crossed, bent at the hips. Pia had her knees together, her feet pointing inwards.
    They walked very carefully out of the café, but Lena couldn't stop the drops escaping her
    with every step. They turned the corner, heading for the door. Lena bit her lip as Pia
    produced her keys. Gingerly the stepped through the door and approached the elevator,
    which fortunately was awaiting them.<br>
    <br>
    Inside Pia stepped up to Lena and pressed herself against her, kissing her wetly. Knowing
    she was about to give in Lena opened up, letting a three-second gusher soak her crotch.
    Boldly she slipped her hand up Pia's skirt, feeling the warm wetness.<br>
    <br>
    They reached Pia's apartment, nearly bursting through the door, Pia leading them to the
    bathroom. They stood, hands in crotches. -Naked, Pia said.<br>
    <br>
    They undressed hurriedly, both girls dribbling when bending over. Then Pia knelt in front
    of Lena and kissed her steaming mound. -Okay, she said. -All over me.<br>
