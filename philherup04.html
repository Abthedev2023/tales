    <strong>CHAPTER III - A DIME FOR THE REVOLUTION</strong><br>
    <br>
    The wait paid off, for when Katie rounded the corner towards the history library a few
    moments past 8:00, Penny was sitting at a table there, pretending to read an old Time
    magazine. &quot;Hi!&quot; Katie said cheerfully as she sat down. For once, the
    cheerfulness wasn't made up; Katie was delighted to have this slender reed of hope to
    cling to.<br>
    <br>
    Penny was happy - for the first time since the Deluge - as well. &quot;Hey! I was just
    reading about Watergate here. It's amazing how far back the magazines go.&quot; As she
    closed the magazine, she couldn't help allowing a nervous glance at the Swineherd standing
    guard by the library door, not even fifteen feet away. They'd found each other, but how
    were they going to communicate?<br>
    <br>
    Katie had that taken care of. &quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;Just the other day Lisa
    Macaulay told me the same thing.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Lisa Macaulay?&quot; Penny mused. &quot;I didn't know the two of you were
    friends.&quot; Katie and Lisa had run in very different circles - to the extent that Katie
    had run in anyone's circle at all - before the Deluge.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sure,&quot; Katie nodded. &quot;We have plenty in common.&quot; She winked on the
    &quot;plenty.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Really? Like what - oh, right!&quot; All the pieces fell quickly into place for
    Penny. &quot;Yes, now I remember Lisa.&quot; Lisa Macaulay was the sports editor of the
    school paper, probably the first female sports editor they'd ever had. She was athletic
    and outgoing and very friendly with the guys, but word in the girls' locker room had
    always had it that she guarded her virginity like a hawk. No doubt she'd frustrated more
    than one football player in her time. &quot;You know, I think Caryn told me the same thing
    once. She was doing a paper on something in here last year.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Caryn?&quot; Neither of the girls knew Caryn's last name, but everyone in the
    Maxiversity knew her first. Big and tall since the sixth grade, she'd been stronger than
    any of the guys back in middle school - and there was no way they'd have forgotten.
    &quot;I don't know,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Would Caryn really have done any work in here?
    She doesn't seem like the type to work with other people.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It depends on the circumstances,&quot; Penny answered. &quot;If she was under a lot
    of pressure, she might've wanted the help. And she could've helped others if she was in
    the mood.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good point,&quot; Katie conceded. &quot;We could ask both of them about finding that
    magazine we wanted, from the year after that one you've got. I've got the date written
    here.&quot; She handed Penny a small slip of paper, discreetly enough that the guard
    probably didn't notice.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay!&quot; Penny said. &quot;I guess the two of them will be enough to at least
    start the search, you think?&quot; Seeing the guard checking down the rows of books, she
    whispered, &quot;company.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie nodded, and rocked back and forth a bit in her seat. &quot;Oh God, do I have to go
    to the bathroom,&quot; she said loudly enough to be overheard.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I know!&quot; Penny concurred. It was true, but more importantly- both girls knew
    they were keeping the guard happy by telling him what he wanted to hear. But thinking
    about it didn't help much for Penny, who'd last been allowed to pee about five hours
    before and would have to wait over two more until lockdown. To think she'd never even gone
    three hours between bathroom trips in her life before the Deluge!<br>
    <br>
    Katie - also no camel in her previous life - decided she needed to stand up and move her
    legs for a while before she lost her mind entirely. &quot;So, you'll let me know if you
    find that copy you were looking for?&quot; Subtly she gestured towards the note she'd
    passed to Penny and clenched both fists tightly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay,&quot; Penny responded, keeping the note out of sight as the guard strolled
    past. &quot;Thanks a lot. See you!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie waited until she was out of the immediate sight of the guard and headed off towards
    the cells - and the guitar supply room. Two months and no sign of change - the guitar
    supply room still appeared to be secure. Katie had been pretty sure that no one on the
    football team ever went near the music department if he could help it, so it stood to
    reason that the tiny, obscure room which didn't open directly into any hallway would be
    unbeknownst to the Swineherds. Sure enough, she'd snuck in there several times when she
    knew she wouldn't need to be accounted for, and there was no sign whatsoever that the
    Swineherds had been anywhere near the place. It had quickly become a fiercely guarded
    secret, for it had been her only refuge from the storm. Katie supposed she would never
    forget the shelter that room had offered her after the first time she'd been buzzed.<br>
    <br>
    It wasn't even a week since then, and already she'd done her best to relegate it to the
    same realm of her mind as one does with a bad dream. His name was Brian, and he was a
    particularly barbaric ex-football guy. Katie knew nothing of football and she cared even
    less for it, but everybody knew who played at the old high school.<br>
    <br>
    Katie - like most of the other quiet, nerdy girls - was relatively lucky in the early days
    of the Maxiversity. When the Swineherds needed a favor in those first weeks, they'd
    concentrated mostly on the cheerleaders and other former &quot;in-crowd&quot; members, the
    ones who'd so often turned down the guys' advances back in the McGlown administration and
    before. Revenge is sweet, after all. But it hadn't taken long for most of the guys to get
    bored with the same girls, and the ones like Katie were certainly the next most desirable-
    the ones who'd always been completely off-limits, unattainable; the ones who'd never seen
    them as heroes just because of their brute strength like so many others had.<br>
    <br>
    A few of the quieter, smarter girls had been singled out for attention from the very
    beginning - Penny, with her breasts, and Jennifer Lipski because she'd always been so
    obnoxious with boys and girls alike in the old days - but most of the others were simply
    left to do chores and wait for bathroom breaks all day long- at first. For Katie, that had
    changed six days before when, for the first time, she felt the electric buzzer they all
    had to wear on their hips inside the jumpsuits going off. She'd been finishing up the
    dishes on her usual lunchtime shift when the jolt came through.<br>
    <br>
    While Katie had been largely shielded from the worst of the horrors, her cellmate Dara was
    a particularly manipulative ex-captain of the drill team who'd suffered no end of cruelty
    from the beginning. Praying she wouldn't draw a Swineherd as bitter towards her as the
    ones who'd called on Dara all those times, Katie had no choice but to head towards the
    room she'd been summoned to. It was the former Advanced U.S. History room, where she had
    once upon a time had one of her favorite classes.<br>
    <br>
    Brian was alone in there with two of his buddies whom Katie didn't recognize, and he
    smiled snidely when she walked in. &quot;Ah, there you are, cunt,&quot; he said when she
    walked in. &quot;Didn't I tell ya guys? Longest legs in the max.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Looks like, Brian,&quot; agreed one of the other guys, while the other one nodded
    his approval as well. To Katie he said, &quot;Stand there, cunt. Right in the middle of
    the room.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Silently terrified, Katie did as she was told, and waited for the next instruction. She
    forced a slight smile, as if to make the guys think they weren't getting to her.<br>
    <br>
    The guy who hadn't yet said anything stood up and walked around her. Still without a word,
    he bent down and took a long, hard look at her crotch, which as always was pressed tightly
    against her too-small jumpsuit. Finally breaking his silence, he remarked, &quot;You're
    awfully tall for that suit.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; Katie knew from Dara never to disagree with a Swineherd, nor to say
    more than was necessary in response to his questions.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That get uncomfortable pressing against your pussy all day long?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Wincing internally at the derogatory name for the most beautiful part of her body, Katie
    said, &quot;Yes, sometimes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How uncomfortable?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;More so as the day goes by. Sometimes the cloth rubs too hard.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    It was Brian's turn to ask questions. &quot;Do you have to pee, cunt? And how bad?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, very badly.&quot; Katie perked up inside in hopes they'd let her use the
    bathroom, even if they made her do it in front of them all.<br>
    <br>
    Instead, Brian just thought about it for a moment. &quot;Are you having a hard time
    standing still?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes.&quot; And it was getting worse the more she had to talk - and think - about it!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll bet that cloth rubbing up against your pussy doesn't help.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; Katie admitted, &quot;it doesn't.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Does it help to move your legs?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie smiled from sheer embarrassment, and instinctively began wiggling one leg.
    &quot;Somewhat.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Did we say you could move your leg, cunt?&quot; asked the third guy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, sir,&quot; Katie admitted, standing still again.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But if it helps, why don't you take off your suit and
    walk around the room?&quot; It was a command, not a question.<br>
    <br>
    Katie, who'd grown up with her mother and her aunt in a small, cramped apartment, was used
    to undressing in front of other women. As she reluctantly revealed her body to the first
    three males of any type who had ever seen her naked, she did her best to pretend it was
    just her mother and aunt who stood before her, grinning hungrily. Her tall, once subtly
    shapely body was pale and too gaunt now, and the pleasantly heavy sprinkling of hair,
    which had adorned her arms and pubic area, was history. But her undeniable feminine
    dignity and the grace she'd seemed to be born with were still there. That fact, along with
    the slender reed of hope that this was the worst she'd have to do, provided Katie with
    some hope as she began parading around the room for her audience.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Great taste, Brian,&quot; one or the other of the guys said as they watched.
    &quot;Look at those legs. You always been tall, cunt?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, since the fourth grade,&quot; Katie replied.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Great.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Perhaps five minutes passed before the same guy asked the question that sent a deeper
    chill down her spine than even the order to undress had done. &quot;Can I touch her,
    Brian?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You can touch the one you request,&quot; Brian said to her momentary relief. Thank
    God she'd been facing away from the guys when that came out, she thought to herself, for
    she was certain her reaction had been visible on her face.<br>
    <br>
    The relief didn't last long. Katie turned back around to find Brian standing near her and
    grinning. &quot;Okay, stop. He doesn't get to touch you. Only I get that.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie could barely disguise her horror, but at least she'd had that slight chance to brace
    herself for being touched. Goosebumps flaring everywhere, she clenched her jaw and stared
    straight out the window at the melting snow, waiting for the ultimate indignity. Brian ran
    his hands up and down both legs several times, cooing over how smooth they were and
    staring straight at Katie's mercilessly exposed vulva. Bored at last with her legs, he
    stood up straight and smiled knowingly as he roughly palmed the hairless labia. Katie did
    her best not to flinch as he ran his hand over her opening a few times, pulling the lips
    apart at one point and venturing one finger inside, to her silent displeasure. All of her
    strength was concentrated in that moment on holding back her bulging bladder, which
    Brian's touch stimulated even beyond the excruciating urge she'd learned to live with
    almost all the time by then.<br>
    <br>
    Satisfied, Brian stepped back and said simply, &quot;Get your suit on and get out,
    cunt.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie eagerly did as she was told, resisting the urge to beg for a trip to the bathroom.
    She had an even greater urge now: the urge to get as far as possible from Brian and his
    buddies. As quickly as she had her suit snapped on, she was gone without another glance at
    the boys.<br>
    <br>
    On her way to her hideout, Katie finally allowed herself a few tears, even though that
    could bring trouble from any Swineherd who happened to walk by. At least, she admitted to
    herself, she'd been treated less severely than Dara had. If she could get away with no
    worse than that day's experience before this nightmare ended - if it ended - perhaps her
    spirit would one day be intact again. She nearly had convinced herself of that when she
    got to the guitar room, but the moment she knew she was safe, the tears came harder than
    before.<br>
    <br>
    That night after meeting with Penny, Katie did her best not to remember just how long
    she'd cried. It didn't matter now. All that mattered was being like Penny - not losing
    hope - and finding more sisters in arms to help with the fight. The revolution. She had
    told Penny of her secret room in that note and urged her to bring other girls there if she
    was quite sure they could be trusted. In so doing, Katie had given up the only thing that
    hadn't been taken from her and had risked considerable trouble if she were found out.
    Despite the severe consequences, it didn't seem like much to her. A token, perhaps. But,
    Katie reminded herself, it was all that was hers to give. It's my token, she thought in as
    encouraging a frame of mind as she could muster. I'm going to put in my dime for the
    revolution.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CHAPTER IV - THE BOOK OF THREE</strong><br>
    <br>
    Penny didn't dare look at the note Katie had given to her until past bed check that night.
    She'd stuffed it inconspicuously inside her pillowcase when she'd returned to her cell,
    even seeing to it that her cellmate, Jae, didn't know. Penny hadn't known Jae at all
    before the tragedy had thrown them together, and although they got along as well as could
    be expected, she wasn't sure how far she could trust the ex-cheerleader who had little to
    do with girls like Penny back in the McGlown Administration.<br>
    <br>
    Those doubts floated in and out of Penny's mind at 10:30 as she sat nervously on the edge
    of her bed, watching Tom Postette - her and Jae's usual guard - insert Jae's bladder tube.
    It was nearly as unpleasant to watch it happening to someone else, as it was to go through
    oneself. As usual, Penny felt a mix of humiliation, fear, and anticipation as she knew
    that in moments it would be her body at the mercy of Tom's hands, but that moments after
    that she'd be rid of her bladder pressure until sometime the next morning. Nearly eight
    hours since the last break now, and she was so full her eyes were welling.<br>
    <br>
    As Tom finished with Jae and pulled her covers roughly over her, he turned to Penny and
    said, &quot;Your turn, cunt. Strip.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Embarrassed even though she'd been through this with Tom every night for two months, Penny
    stood up and pulled off her suit. Clenching her legs together as tightly as she could, she
    folded the suit and left it on the designated shelf. Following established rigmarole, she
    lay down with the covers pulled back and her legs spread, clamping down on every muscle in
    her crotch to hold back the call of nature.<br>
    <br>
    Tom stepped over and plugged the fresh, sterilized tube into the collection unit. With one
    hand on Penny's thigh, he leaned over the bed and stuffed the rubber hose slowly but
    firmly into her vagina. He could feel the increased resistance as the hose slid over the
    valve, while Penny could feel the valve open and her balloon-like bladder and its
    attachments began draining. &quot;Enjoy it while it lasts,&quot; Tom said sarcastically to
    both girls as he stood up and headed out of the room.<br>
    <br>
    As soon as the door was locked, Jae turned out the light on her side of the room while
    Penny reached in her pillowcase and retrieved the note. Cherishing the relief that was
    still flowing from between her legs, she unfolded the paper, unnoticed by Jae.<br>
    <br>
    Curiously and hopefully, she read the note.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><em><br>
    </em>Dear Penny,<br>
    <br>
    Thank God you had the nerve to talk me into getting together! I can't imagine much more
    time in this place without losing my mind completely. But I do believe that they can't
    hold us here if enough of us get together! At this point I don't know what we can do, but
    there is one way I can help. There's a room in the music department where I often go,
    which the Swineherds don't know about. It's probably the only thing that's kept me sane
    thus far at all, and I think it would be perfect place for us to meet with any other girls
    who are willing.<br>
    <br>
    I hope you realize this room is absolutely the only thing I can offer anyone right now,
    and we're taking a big risk in letting anyone else know about it. Please, please be
    careful whom you tell about it! I will be there during Free Hour tomorrow, and I hope to
    see you with Lisa and/or Caryn, and anyone else you can think of who is a worthy risk.
    Best of luck, I'll be praying for us both!!<br>
    <br>
    Love,<br>
    <br>
    Katie<br>
    <br>
    p.s. Please destroy this note. If the Swineherds ever found it, we'd be tortured for sure!</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thrilled to know they now had a hideout, Penny immediately began shredding the letter into
    scraps as tiny as she could get them. Already she was mapping out plans for the next day
    in her mind when she heard a girl's voice over her shoulder.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Would you stop that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Penny rolled over to see Jae looking over at her; it was about the most her cellmate had
    ever had to say to her. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Penny finally said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We don't have much time to sleep, you know. And the guys keep me busy in the
    daytime.&quot; Her voice started to crack on the second sentence, and Penny could see she
    was about to cry.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sorry, really! I didn't mean to cause any trouble. And I'm sorry about the guys.
    All the stuff they do is so disgusting.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I have a hunch it's not as bad for you as it is for me,&quot; Jae said. &quot;I went
    out with a lot of those guys before, and just 'cause I wouldn't put out with them, they're
    all over me now.&quot; By then she was crying quite hard, but trying her best to keep it
    quiet.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I believe that,&quot; Penny said. Swineherds paid plenty of attention to her
    breasts, but they didn't seem to have a lot of concern for her one way or the other beyond
    that. She was quiet for a minute or two, but Jae's sobbing did not stop. It was worth
    asking.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jae?&quot; Penny asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Would you like to join a group of us to fight back?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fight back?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How? What can we do?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We don't know yet,&quot; Penny admitted. &quot;But once we have a group together,
    we'll have strength in numbers. Their biggest weapon is keeping us apart. But I found
    another girl tonight, that's what the letter I was reading was about. We're going to get a
    group together and fight back.<br>
    <br>
    Jae thought about it for a moment. &quot;I don't see what we can do against them, but I
    guess if you've got other girls helping you, we need to try. This can't go on
    forever.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It won't, Jae. Meet me here tomorrow just before Free Hour.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What then?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay,&quot; Jae sniffled. &quot;Good night.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good night.&quot; Penny shut her light off and drifted off to sweet sleep, visions
    of freedom delighting her.<br>
