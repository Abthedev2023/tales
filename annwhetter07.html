      <p>Mary and June were sitting on the train at the start of their trip. It 
      would take most of the day as they were on the way to a Holiday Camp where 
      June's sister Jane was the warden and they had jobs for the summer 
      vacation. They had been taken to the station by June's mother who had 
      helped them onto the train with their bags after treating them to drinks 
      in the buffet. She had left them with a bag of goodies to eat on the 
      journey and a case of bottled water saying pointedly that if Mary was like 
      June, they would need them for the journey.</p>
      <p>"Whatever did your mother mean?" asked Mary as the train started to 
      move and they waved goodbye. "Surely we won't drink all that. Oh and what 
      was all that about 'On the train' when you interrupted your Mum as she was 
      saying 'Have you told..'?"</p>
      <p>Well" answered June with some hesitation. "You're going to find out 
      eventually anyway so I might as well tell you now. -And you might even 
      want to join in." she added hopefully.</p>
      <p>"Tell me what?" demanded Mary.</p>
      <p>"Its just that....." said June "Well, we'll be sharing a room and 
      possibly the same bed and.." she hesitated again.</p>
      <p>"Is that all?" said Mary "Well I don't mind, I often shared a bed with 
      my sister when we went on holiday."</p>
      <p>"Yes, that's all very well" said June "But did either of you wet it" 
      she blurted out.</p>
      <p>"Not since we were kids" admitted Mary. But why do you ask?"</p>
      <p>"Because I do" replied June.</p>
      <p>"Oh" said Mary "Do you mean that you wet the bed when you're 
      asleep?"</p>
      <p>"No" said June "I wake up if need a pee, but I don't bother to get out 
      and go to the bathroom I just lie there and wet the bed. It's usually wet 
      anyway" she added "as most nights I wet the bed before going to 
sleep."</p>
      <p>"Wow" said Mary "Well don't worry about it. If we share a bed and you 
      wet it I promise I won't make a fuss."</p>
      <p>"Thanks" said June gratefully "but that's not all. I deliberately wet 
      my knickers during the day as well. There now I've told you, I know I 
      should have mentioned it before, but you're so kind I thought that you'd 
      understand."</p>
      <p>"It's OK" consoled Mary "I do understand, in fact I've had a couple of 
      accidents myself this year and it didn't bother me, so I won't get upset 
      when you wet yourself."</p>
      <p>"Thanks again, I do appreciate it" said June, "Would you like some 
      water?"</p>
      <p>"I don't think I'd better" replied Mary "After those drinks in the 
      buffet I already need to find the toilet."</p>
      <p>"That's good" said June and she moved round to sit beside Mary "How 
      about not going to find the toilet?"</p>
      <p>"If I don't find it soon, I'll wet myself" replied Mary.</p>
      <p>"That's the idea" confirmed June. "If it helps, I'll sit here so you 
      can't get out and it will be an accident."</p>
      <p>"Do you mean that you want me to wet my knickers? asked Mary.</p>
      <p>"Of course I do" said June "If you do we can share the great feelings 
      you get when you wet your knickers. On a long journey like this" she 
      continued "I like to be desperate to pee all the way and just let a little 
      bit out when I really have to, so I drink lots of water to keep myself 
      topped up."</p>
      <p>"Does your mother know about this?" asked Mary "and is that why she 
      bought all those drinks in the buffet and gave us the bottles of 
      water?"</p>
      <p>"Of course she knows" replied June "In fact she wets herself too and so 
      does my sister."</p>
      <p>"Right" said Mary "It sounds as though we're going to have a very wet 
      time. But I'm not ready to wet myself yet" she added "so perhaps I will 
      have some of that water."</p>
      <p>June passed her a bottle and opened one for herself. "Here's to a good 
      wet time" she said and they both drunk deeply.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before they were both wriggling on their seats and then 
      June said "I can't hold on any longer" and with that she pulled her skirt 
      up at the back so she wasn't sitting on it and started to wet herself. 
      After a few squirts she stopped and said to Mary "Wow that feels so 
      good"</p>
      <p>"I can't hold it any longer" said Mary.</p>
      <p>"Don't forget to pull your skirt back" advised June quickly, so Mary 
      pulled her skirt up at the back and started to wet her own knickers. "It's 
      quite difficult to stop" she exclaimed as she struggled to arrest the 
      flow."</p>
      <p>"Yes" agreed June "I had trouble at first, but I soon managed to get it 
      under control."</p>
      <p>"Ah, that's it, I've managed and I still need to pee. Gosh I can see 
      why you like wetting yourself. Isn't it great, that delicious naughty 
      feeling?"</p>
      <p>"Oh I'm so glad you like it too" commented June. "It looks like we're 
      going to have a really good summer."</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before there was a puddle under both their seats and 
      when she noticed it Mary said to June "Woops, we seem to have a bit of a 
      flood on the floor."</p>
      <p>"Not to worry" said June and she poured the last drops from her bottle 
      of water onto the edge of the table and laid the bottle on it's side next 
      to it. "Now anyone will think that we just spilled the water" she 
      explained.</p>
      <p>"I'm really getting into this wetting lark" admitted Mary "and I think 
      that I might wet the bed tonight -that is if you think that it won't 
      matter"</p>
      <p>"Of course it won't matter" said June. "All the beds at the camp are 
      protected because a surprising number of holiday makers wet the beds; some 
      because they get drunk and don't know what they're doing and some just wet 
      the beds anyway."</p>
      <p>Just then the train stopped at a station and two girls got on. As the 
      first passed their seats, June nudged Mary and nodded at the back of her 
      skirt which had a distinct wet patch on it. The second girl, noticed the 
      water bottle on the table, glanced down at the floor and saw the puddle. 
      "Helen" she called to her friend "Here will do" and she put her bag in the 
      rack over the seats next to Mary and June. Helen came back and did the 
      same. They were just sitting down as the train moved off and June said 
      "Hello, I'm June and this is Mary."</p>
      <p>"Hello" replied the second girl, "I'm Sue and this is Helen. I hope you 
      don't mind if we sit here"</p>
      <p>"Not at all" replied Mary.</p>
      <p>"It's just that I noticed your bottle of water on the table and the 
      puddle on the floor and thought that you might..." and Sue hesitated.</p>
      <p>"It's OK" said June "You're right, we are wetting our knickers and 
      we'll continue to wet them for the rest of the journey. We've hitched our 
      skirts up so that it won't show when we get off."</p>
      <p>"I forgot to do that" admitted Helen. "But I'm new to this. Sue 
      introduced me to it a couple of days ago ready for this trip. We're on our 
      way to work at the holiday camp at ******" she added.</p>
      <p>"I thought that we'd get a good wetting in on the train ride in case we 
      can't wet ourselves whilst working." added Sue.</p>
      <p>"You don't need to worry about that" said June "You'll be able to wet 
      yourselves whenever and wherever you like, and your bed as well if you 
      want"</p>
      <p>"Are you sure" asked Sue with a look of glee on her face.</p>
      <p>"Quite sure" said June and she took a long swig of water from her 
      bottle "We're going there as well and my sister is the manager!"</p>
      <p>"Cool" said Helen "It's great that we met you and that you wet 
      yourselves as well" and she too drank from her water bottle.</p>
      <p>"I like the empty water bottle trick" said Sue as she put her own now 
      empty bottle on it's side on the table. But it didn't fool me." </p>
      <p>"Yes" agreed June "but if you hadn't seen it you wouldn't have sat 
      here. But I haven't noticed either of you wetting yet and we've been 
      continually letting a bit out."</p>
      <p>"Well we both wet ourselves whilst sitting on a bench waiting for the 
      train and hadn't thought of just letting a bit out and being continuously 
      desperate" explained Sue "but I'm getting desperate and will start to wet 
      my knickers again soon."</p>
      <p>"I can't hold on any longer" blurted Helen "and I don't know if I'll be 
      able to stop once I get started."</p>
      <p>"It won't matter if you don't stop, you'll soon get the hang of it and 
      we've a long way to go yet. I did it for the first time not long ago and 
      now I can stop almost as soon as I start" said Mary.</p>
      <p>"You're right" agreed Helen "I've managed to stop."</p>
      <p>"Well done" congratulated June "Now quickly top up with water." They 
      all took long swigs from their bottles and almost immediately let out some 
      more wee into their knickers. And so they spent the rest of the journey 
      continually drinking and wetting their knickers.</p>
      <p>"If we carry on drinking this evening we'll be able to wet our beds all 
      night as well" announced June.</p>
      <p>As the train was slowing for their destination and they were preparing 
      to leave the train Helen gasped "Oh no, I forgot to lift my skirt up 
      again."</p>
      <p>"Never mind" consoled June. "Just tie the arms of your jumper round 
      your waist and it will hide the back of your skirt."</p>
      <p>The camp was only round the corner from the station and they were soon 
      there.</p>
      <p>"Oh good, you've met" said June's sister Janet and the worried frown on 
      her face lightened a bit.</p>
      <p>"Yes, we met on the train here" said June. "But what's up?"</p>
      <p>"Well we have a bit of a problem" replied Janet. "The computer went 
      down and somehow we overbooked for most of the summer. The only solution I 
      can see is if we all sleep in the barn and I use our rooms for the 
      campers" she explained. "I would of course pay a bonus for that and I will 
      give you some cash which you can spend on some air beds. Or" she added 
      "glancing at Helen's jumper "if you like, you can keep the cash and we can 
      use the old mattresses that are out there in the barn. They're still 
      comfortable they just have a few stains."</p>
      <p>"They'll have a lot more by the end of the summer" said June with a 
      grin. "We won't have to protect them. Our wee will run straight through 
      and soak into the floor out in the barn and we won't have to clear up 
      under our beds in the morning."</p>
      <p>"Does that mean that we really can wet our beds?" asked Sue "June told 
      us on the train that we would be able too, but we didn't truly believe 
      her."</p>
      <p>"Of course you can" agreed Janet "All the girls who work here do, and 
      of course we wet our knickers as well. I hoped that you two would be 
      persuaded to join in once you got here and I thought that as Mary is 
      June's friend she would naturally be a wetter."</p>
      <p>"I've been wetting my knickers as long as I can remember" admitted Sue 
      "and introduced Helen to it a few days ago, but we haven't wet our beds 
      yet. I'm looking forward to that and can hardly wait until tonight."</p>
