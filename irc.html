    </font>The #watersports room is not a Female Desperation only room. It's chatting about
    all kind of pee games. It's not a new room either. A lot of regulars in there know each
    other for many years. That means that there's also a lot of very normal talk, so don't be
    disappointed if not every line contains pee-talk. It's in general not nice to go to a room
    like this and only ask a-s-l or keep bugging women in there by sending private chat
    requests. Try to talk in the main room. As soon as women feel comfortable enough to chat
    in private they will let you know. Always ask this first in the main room. Don't bother
    them with private messages constantely if they don't want to.<br>
    It's not very nice either to pretend you are female when you are not. Stay honest.<br>

    Step 1, What is IRC?</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    </font>IRC (<font color="#006342">Internet Relay Chat</font>) is a virtual meeting place
    where people from all over the world can meet and talk; you'll find the whole diversity of
    human interests, ideas, and issues here, and you'll be able to participate in group
    discussions on one of the many thousands of IRC channels, on hundreds of IRC networks, or
    just talk in private to family or friends, wherever they are in the world.<br>
    <br>
    To use IRC you need a small program like mIRC, an IRC client for Windows, written by
    Khaled Mardam-Bey. mIRC is a friendly IRC client that is well equipped with options and
    tools. mIRC is shareware, which means that you can download mIRC and try it out freely for
    30 days to evaluate it. If during, or at the end of, the evaluation period you decide that
    you would like to continue using mIRC, you can <a href="http://www.mirc.com/register.html"
    target="_blank">register your copy</a>.<br>

    Step 2, How to download and install the IRC program</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    Simply click on <a href="http://www.mirc.com/get.html" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a> and a
    new window will open where you find the <strong>Windows</strong> mIRC downloads. </font>This
    download is a self-extracting executable. The built-in mIRC installer will activate and
    help you to install or upgrade mIRC. To get a fast and reliable download choose a location
    from the list that is close to you.</td>

    Step 3, How to login to a Webnet server</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    IRC uses several different networks and on each network are different channels. There's
    for instance undernet, dalnet, driftnet and so on. The watersports channel is located at
    the <strong>webnet</strong> (network) server.<br>
    As soon as you have the program installed and run in, it starts with a &quot;About
    mIRC&quot; screen. Simply click this away and your login screen will appear. On top is a
    box where you must choose your IRC server. That's in this case <strong>Webnet</strong>.
    Fill in the 4 boxes below the way you want. Remember that others will see that
    information, so be carefull with your real name and email addres. Find yourself a nickname
    (that is not yet registred) and click on &quot;<strong>connect to IRC server</strong>&quot;.<br>
    If it's the first time you login, the server will not recognise your nickname and will
    tell you to register it first. This is necessary otherwise you won't be able to enter the
    watersports chatroom if there is no operator present. Also... you have to login to IRC at
    least every two weeks otherwise your registered nickname will disappear from the IRC
    database automatically.</font></td>

    Step 4, Register your nickname and identify yourself</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    This one is easy:<br>
    /msg nickserv REGISTER &quot;password&quot; &quot;email addres&quot;&nbsp; (The email
    adress must be a valid one)<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    <strong>/msg nickserv REGISTER 12ABC345DEF jim@watersportschatroom.com</strong><br>
    <br>
    Next you tell IRC that you are you and that not some else is using your nickname:<br>
    </font>/msg nickserv IDENTIFY &quot;password&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#000000">Example:<br>

    Step 5, How to join the #watersports channel</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    It now get's simple. You're in the so called &quot;status window&quot;. Type in the box
    down under where the cursor is blinking: <strong>/join #watersports<br>
    </strong>Don't forget that there's a space between &quot;/join&quot; and #<br>
    You can also choose the #watersports channel out of the channels folder.<br>
    NOTE:&nbsp; IRC remembers what server you were on the last time you were there. Not what
    channel you were. So there are no worries that someone else from your family clicks on the
    mIRC icon and automatically &quot;walks&quot; into the peeing room.</font></td>

    Step 6, Tips and Tricks</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
    <br>
    Once your nickname is registered you can make your sign-in automatically by clicking on
    the option icon on the top bar and go to the IRC/perform tab. In the window that appears
    on the right you can tell mIRC what to do at starting up. In here you can type for
    instance:</font><br>
    <strong>/msg nickserv identify &quot;password&quot;</strong><br>
    <br>
    In that case mIRC will go look for your now registered nickname and logs your nickname in
    automatically. Otherwise you have to do this manually each time you enter IRC. It doesn't
    automatically log you in to the watersports channel !&nbsp; However that is possible too
    if you add the /join #watersports to the perform window too.<br>
    <br>
    If you wanna use DCC you need to type <strong>/umode -eImMc</strong> first otherwise DCC
    will be disabled. ( The second character is a capital i )<br>
