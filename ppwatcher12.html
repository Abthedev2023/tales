    <br>
    <br>
    The ride had been long, hot and dusty across the Painted Desert of the American southwest
    in my 60 Chevy Impala convertible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie and
    I had left for home after an early morning breakfast that included a lot of coffee and
    juice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We choose to go west for spring break
    instead of the typical Florida or Padre Island thing that most college kids choose, as we
    both loved the desert and had friends in Palm Springs. <o:p></o:p></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As we drove along that
    stretch of deserted blacktop, listening to music on the radio, we talked and kept drinking
    away at a cooler of cokes that we had purchased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
    couple of hours into the desert, having long passed the last remnants of civilization, or
    at least a gas station with a bathroom, I noticed that Jackie was not talking quite as
    much as she had been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At first I figured that
    she was just tired, as the week had been filled with long hours of partying and letting
    off steam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of miles later I happened
    to glance over and saw her give her pussy a quick little squeeze and then just as quickly
    move her hand away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought that
    she was just making a little adjustment when I noticed that she had her legs gently
    swaying back and forth in a rhythmic clapping motion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>My first thought was she needed to pee, and just as quickly I decided that
    she was just bored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I couldn't help but watch Jackie a
    little more intently at that point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her legs
    never stopped moving and she seemed to be shifting around in the seat a lot more than I
    expected, as if trying to get comfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    also caught her squeezing her pussy again when she thought I wasn't looking. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was no doubt about it now
    Jackie needed to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had drunk at least
    3 cups of coffee for breakfast and 2 or 3 cokes since we had left the restaurant.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her bladder must be getting full by now.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at that point that I realized that I too
    needed to take a pee although it was not very urgent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>We hadn't seen a car in an hour and a building in longer than that.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know exactly how long it would be till we
    got to the next inhabited place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I looked over at Jackie and said,
    &quot;I don't know about you, but I need to stop and get rid of some of this coffee and
    coke.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie just looked over at me and
    kind of said &quot;Oh&quot; with a funny look on her face.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Then she asked, &quot;Do you think there is a gas station or something
    around pretty soon?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I need a pee break
    myself.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to be honest and tell her
    that I just didn't know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her
    &quot;don't worry, we haven't seen a car in an hour, you can pee by the side of the road,
    no one will see.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie didn't say
    anything to that at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I eased the car over onto the
    shoulder of the road and came to a stop and looked at Jackie and asked her if she wanted
    to go first.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She just grimaced and shook her
    head no.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got out, went to the back of the
    car and took a long, noisy, much needed pee onto the sand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>There was no way that Jackie could not hear the pee splattering to the
    ground and as I glanced over to her, I could see that she was wiggling in her seat and
    that the sound of my relief was not helping her situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>After about a minute I finished up, shook the last bit of dew from the tip
    and put my dick away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked back to the
    car, hopped in and said &quot;your turn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jackie looked at me with a look of
    desperation and horror as she just sat there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    asked her if she was going to pee and she quietly told me &quot; no, I can't.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she sat there squirming in the seat, obviously
    in pain from a desperate need to pee I asked her what she meant by saying she couldn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jackie then told me that she just
    couldn't pee that way in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had
    never been able to pee in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her
    that this wasn't really in public as no one was around but me and I would not watch.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She then began to tell me that she was terribly
    bladder shy unless she was in a completely enclosed stall with a door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With out a stall and door or a locked bathroom
    that no one could enter, she just could not bring herself to pee.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would try and try but nothing ever came out.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her &quot;how do you manage to hold on
    that long till you get to a bathroom,&quot; and she began to cry telling me she didn't a
    lot of times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stated that she couldn't
    pee in public, but when it got bad enough she couldn't help but pee in her pants.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stated that she had had many accidents over
    the years when she could not find a bathroom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I told Jackie to give it a try, as
    she was wiggling and rocking in the seat clapping her legs together.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told me she would, but she didn't think it
    would work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie got out of the car, walked
    to the back fender, and unzipped her pants. I could hear the rustle of her pants and
    panties being lowered and then silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    a couple of minutes she pulled her pants back up and hopped in the car saying that it was
    of no use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie asked me to hurry and see
    if we couldn't come across a gas station or somewhere with a bathroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I drove off, I noticed that she
    now was not only wiggling and rocking in the seat but that she had her hand between her
    legs squeezing her pussy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie began to
    tell me that it started as a girl about 4 or 5 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She stated that she remembered going to her grandmother's house with her
    other brothers and sisters and one day she waited to long to go pee while playing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She ran into the house and found the bathroom
    occupied and began squirming like little girls do and crying.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her grandmother saw her and when she found out she
    was about to make &quot;pee pee&quot; in her panties she grabbed her up and carried her to
    the old garage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In the garage her grandmother took
    off her panties and held her up in the air so she could pee telling her to go on the dirt
    floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie stated that she was so afraid
    that she couldn't pee and began to cry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
    then a bunch of neighborhood kids ran in while playing and saw her without her underwear
    being held up by her grandmother and they began to laugh at her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie said that since that day she could never
    pee with someone around or out in the open. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she told this story she was
    rocking harder in the seat and moaning about her overly distended bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie was a slender girl that liked tight jeans
    and I could see a slight bulge in her jeans from her distended bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was on the verge of crying and obviously in
    great distress over her desperate need to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    pulled over to the side of the road and told her to try again.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said, &quot;I can't.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can never pee this way.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her to try anyway.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jackie jumped out and didn't even
    attempt to hide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She hurt so much that she
    just couldn't move anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She dropped her
    jeans and squatted in the doorway trying to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    could hear her grunt as she tried desperately to force out the smallest little drop to
    relieve her agony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she began to cry she
    pulled up her jeans and turned toward the car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At that point it was all over.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I heard her gasp quickly and state &quot;no, no,
    no.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I heard it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That unmistakable hiss of pent up urine rapidly
    escaping into her jeans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The crotch of her
    jeans darkened rapidly and the river of pee ran down the legs of her tight jeans.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stood there with a stunned look on her face
    her hand now soaked, still in her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    tears fell almost as fast at the pent up pee escaping her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pee eventually slowed and then stopped.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her jeans were wet half way up to her waist both
    front and back and soaked all the way to her ankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her white socks were yellow and her shoes sloshed with every movement.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p>Jackie stood there both mortified and in shock at what had just happened.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got out of the car, got her some shorts and
    panties from the trunk and went around to where she was still standing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I helped her out of her wet clothes and handed her
    some dry ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of putting them on,
    she grabbed a towel from the trunk and wrapped it around her waist.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she was too wet to put on clothes right
    then and that she would dry in a few minutes and she would pull them on then.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie dumped her wet clothes into a bag in the
    trunk and hopped in clad in the towel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As we
    headed on down the highway, she sat there quietly for several minutes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jackie apologized for acting like a big baby and
    wetting her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her not to worry
    about it, that those things happen to everyone sometime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She looked at me and said that's true, but not at 19.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As we rode Jackie began to tell me of other times
    that she had wet her pants due to her shy bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    described the events as if they were yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    she dried she pulled on the dry clothes I got her and she seemed to relax. She began to
    tell me of one particular occasion where she had wet herself on the way home from work one
    night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that is another story.</p>
