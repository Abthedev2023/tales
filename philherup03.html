    <strong>CHAPTER I - ANOTHER ORDINARY MORNING</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Jae and Penny hurried uncomfortably through the Maxiversity hallway to the next exam
    session. One hellish semester, six humiliating months, behind them, and still no sign of
    the promised revolution. Even Lisa, the eternal optimist of the Bird Women, and Caryn, the
    most muscular and intimidating of the oppressed group, were losing their hope. Doing her
    best to ignore the intense summons emanating from between her long legs, Jae shuddered to
    think what she and her friends would do without Lisa and Caryn to give them hope.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;D'you think this bunch will be as rude as the boys from last week?&quot; Jae asked
    Penny between short breaths.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hope not,&quot; the shorter girl answered. &quot;You'd think they'd never seen a
    girl before at all. Even the Swineherds aren't that clueless about us.&quot; As she said
    it, Penny gathered up the baggy pant-legs of the shapeless jumpsuit she and all the girls
    were required to wear, hoping to lessen the friction. They were, after all, in a big
    hurry.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cruel, but not clueless,&quot; Jae concurred.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes!&quot; Penny sounded near tears as she struggled with her bladder. Even before
    the Deluge, she'd needed to use the bathroom rather often, like both her parents before
    her; the Swineherds' policy made each moment of the day even more excruciating for her
    than for the other Bird Women. Fortunately, her friends recognized the severity of her
    predicament and did what they could to help her. But such sympathy, kind as it was, could
    only help Penny so much.<br>
    <br>
    The Bird Women- smiling through her discomfort as she and Jae approached the appointed
    classroom, Penny marveled at the one victory she and her friends had achieved in the five
    months, two weeks and five days since the downfall of the McGlown Administration: keeping
    the gang and its beautiful name a secret from the Swineherds. It was Penny herself who'd
    thought of the name, which had been inspired by her friend and cohort Kathleen. Katie to
    her friends, Kathleen to the teachers before the fall; she was beautiful. Tall, poised,
    and exceptionally well-dressed, with fine brown hair which hung nearly to her waist and a
    classically beautiful figure - all of which had been her downfall - she'd struck Penny as
    the definition of all that was positive about women, even in a culture that hated them.
    Graceful like a bird, Penny had thought. And birds were the perfect inspiration for the
    gang, wishing, as they did, to fly away- to be free of it all- to be far from the
    Maxiversity.<br>
    <br>
    It didn't look like Penny and Jae had much hope for anything that beautiful as they
    entered room C-14. Dan McGowan, whom Jae the ex-cheerleader knew as a second-string
    linebacker on the football team before the Deluge, was waiting by the door. &quot;Aw, here
    they are,&quot; he said with a bombastic grin. &quot;How you ladies doin'?&quot; He
    greeted Jae with a clap on the rear end. Jae - a onetime party girl who had many memories
    of Dan coming on to her and her friends like a Mack truck at house parties - winced and
    clenched her Kegel muscles harder than ever as his pat jarred her full bladder, but she
    knew better than to say a word against Dan.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fine, Dan.&quot; Jae even managed a smile as she spoke for herself and her shy
    cellmate.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey. Don't ever call me by my first name, cunt!&quot; Dan's face was inches from
    Jae's; she'd slipped up again!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry, sir.&quot; It was almost physically painful for her to show this note of
    respect to the boy who, she strongly suspected, had put her in the misery she'd been in
    for the past five months. It had to be one of the Swineherds...<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's more like it,&quot; Dan said, backing off a bit. &quot;Now, do we need the
    bathroom before Showtime?&quot; The grin was back. He looked at Penny first.<br>
    <br>
    Fighting back tears, Penny said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You?&quot; he said to Jae.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The grin disappeared. &quot;I knew it all along. You do know how to say yes.&quot; Jae
    flushed as she recalled the episode after the homecoming dance last fall. How different
    these months could have been - but she wasn't sorry. Dan led the two Bird Women across the
    hall to the locked restroom, and unlocked the door into the outer chamber. &quot;Okay.
    Strip.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    It never got any easier, no matter how many times they had to do it, but all the girls
    knew better than to disobey; they all had their own coping mechanisms. Jae's was to
    imagine the boy in front of her - whoever he really was - was Andy, the shy boy in her
    French class the year before with whom she'd had one great study date just days before the
    Deluge. They'd been casual friends for over a year before she'd started inviting him over
    to practice their verbs. Each of their study dates had come to be increasingly
    interspersed with personal conversation, then the occasional hug, and so on until a
    full-blown romance appeared to be in progress. Her parents had been gone that last night.
    After the studying was done, she'd taken him to her room and let him strip her down to bra
    and panties while he took it all off. Then he'd held her gently for the longest, nicest
    time, nothing like the jocks she'd usually dated before. He'd said he'd call her before
    the weekend as he'd kissed her goodbye, but the Deluge had intervened. Jae often wondered
    where Andy was now; she was certain he wasn't among the Swineherds.<br>
    <br>
    But even imagining Andy wasn't going to help this time, as it was the first time she'd had
    to undress for Dan. As she dropped the jumpsuit, she could almost imagine him drooling at
    what she wouldn't let him see before, even if she no longer looked the same naked as she
    had before the Deluge. Her body was waxed from the nape of her neck downward with no trace
    of hair anywhere save her head, while her vaginal area was red and puffy from her
    perpetually distended bladder. Her body was no longer her own. And now it was bare before
    Dan.<br>
    <br>
    But Dan was more interested in Jae's shy cellmate. &quot;There they are,&quot; he said,
    reaching out to jiggle Penny's D-cup breasts gruffly. &quot;Nicest tits in the school, and
    you were never gonna let anybody see 'em!&quot; Penny - her own once-hairy body rendered
    smooth so that she looked like a seven-year old with breasts, looked at the ceiling and
    smiled to force herself not to cry. At least, she reminded herself, she'd soon be allowed
    to pee.<br>
    <br>
    Dan headed for the door to the inner chamber - the stalls - but decided against unlocking
    it just yet. Instead he went to the two sinks next to the door and turned the water on.
    Grinning, he leaned against the counter and watched his two prisoners as they reacted to
    the sound of the running water. First Penny and then Jae were soon wiggling their legs;
    Jae swallowed hard and blinked away a tear or two as best she could. Penny, desperate
    beyond all shame, finally grasped her vulva with both hands and began bobbing up and down
    on the balls of her feet.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Pathetic,&quot; Dan announced. &quot;Grown women, almost.&quot; He finally unlocked
    the inner chamber door and herded the girls inside. The stalls had no doors and the
    toilets were of a singularly undignified type in which a woman placed her feet in
    stirrup-like holds on the floor and leaned back against a cold metal backrest so that her
    knees were bent just enough to probably keep the stream from running down her legs. But
    whenever the Bird Women and their fellow prisoners were allowed in the bathroom at all,
    they were far too desperate to care. Penny and Jae both eagerly stepped into the
    contraptions and, finally given the consenting nod by Dan, let go. The twin hard splashes
    echoed throughout the room for nearly two minutes, as first the girls' natural bladders
    and then their artificial additions from the chemistry lab drained out at last. In spite
    of the humiliation of being watched by Dan, both Bird Women were clearly more comfortable
    when they finally stepped back out to the outer chamber.<br>
    <br>
    Dan handed each of them a clean white bathrobe and stuffed their jumpsuits into the
    laundry chute. &quot;Girls, getting everything dirty,&quot; he grumbled as Jae and Penny
    wrapped themselves in the robes. &quot;You'll get new suits after your show.&quot; Without
    another word, he directed them back across the hall to C-14.<br>
    <br>
    This time the boys looked around twelve or so - nearly twenty of them. Giggles abounded as
    Dan prodded Jae and Penny to front and center. Jae noted to her surprise that a female
    teacher had accompanied the boys this time. An older-looking woman, she stood near the
    back of the room with her hands folded, looking out the window and refusing to acknowledge
    the presence of the girls at all. At least she was uncomfortable - as well she should be,
    Jae thought disgustedly, as Doug Nelson the ex-quarterback launched into his spiel.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;These,&quot; Doug read from his notes, &quot;are young women, fairly average
    specimens. Girls?&quot; At this cue, Jae and Penny removed their robes, prompting gasps
    from most of the boys. &quot;That's right, it makes a lot of us guys uncomfortable seeing
    them,&quot; Doug continued. &quot;That's why we have to keep them down like this,
    otherwise they control us. Notice girls in general are a cheaper cut, that's why so many
    of them are flabby like this.&quot; He tickled Penny's belly, forcing her to break her
    stony composure and whimper a bit. &quot;And, they don't take well to being touched.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    While Doug continued - &quot;They bleed for a week at a time without dying, they have an
    inside readily accessible for our enjoyment, which is the main reason why we keep them
    around at all...&quot; Penny did her best to zone out and blend in with the surroundings
    as best a naked young woman might do in a room full of prepubescent boys. But Jae, more
    accustomed to nudity than her sister-in-arms, refused. Instead, she turned to look boys in
    the eye- if he didn't look away first, hoping to make them all uncomfortable with the
    exploitation they were unwittingly subjecting her to. She was the naked one; therefore she
    demanded far more of them than they could hope to demand of her. Most of the boys turned
    away uncomfortably, much to her delight - but one fair-haired youngster in a green rugby
    shirt did not. He stared back, looking sympathetic and not at all happy about the position
    he found this poor girl in. Realizing he wouldn't be cowed like the others, Jae finally
    allowed a smile for both him and herself. Perhaps there was hope out there after all.<br>
    <br>
    Doug had his hateful lecture wrapped up within about ten minutes. Like most of the girls
    who'd been through it before, Jae and Penny had learned to tune out the horrible things
    the Swineherds said about women and were just glad to make their escape from the
    classroom. Still naked, they were led out of the room by Dan, who handed them fresh
    jumpsuits with another sarcastic grin and ogled them both as they put them on.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now get lost 'til you get buzzed again,&quot; Dan ordered.<br>
    <br>
    Gratefully, the two Bird Women complied and took off for their hideout, off in the music
    department. As soon as they were out of Dan's sight, Penny began crying the tears she'd
    been holding back through the whole episode.<br>
    <br>
    Jae took her friend's hand. &quot;It's okay, Penny. It's over.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For now,&quot; Penny sobbed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; Jae admitted. &quot;For now.&quot; Hand in hand, they filed as
    inconspicuously as they could past the other girls, male servants and Swineherds in the
    hallway. At least they wouldn't have to go to the bathroom for another hour or so. Penny
    tried not to bounce too much and jiggle her breasts. What I wouldn't do for a bra, she
    thought to herself, much as she'd thought every day of the oppression. But all women's
    underwear was strictly prohibited in the Maxiversity.<br>
    <br>
    Back at room C-14, the teacher herded her boys back outside to the school bus. At the end
    of the line out of the room was the fair-haired boy Jae had smiled at, eagerly looking
    around the room and the lobby outside. At just the right moment when Mrs. Pearson and the
    other boys wouldn't notice, he broke from the line and jumped into the nearest darkened
    classroom, hiding under the teacher's desk and waiting for a time when the coast would, he
    hoped, be clear.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>CHAPTER II - WHENCE GREW THE OAK</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Penny - a shy bookworm with a small bladder and a chubby figure - was an unlikely leader,
    and by this May morning she was not really among the leaders within the small band of
    rebels. But all the Bird Women knew that they never would have found each other without
    Penny's diligence, and that if they ever won their freedom they would owe it all to Penny
    for being the only one never to give up. Penny knew it too, and the fact that she never
    rested on her laurels or suggested that her sisters owed her anything only made her even
    more esteemed among the Bird Women. Her quiet voice was always assured of an ear, and on
    the inevitable occasions when the misery boiled up in anger, the anger was never directed
    at Penny.<br>
    <br>
    For all her apparent awkwardness back in the McGlown Administration, Penny was a very
    intelligent young woman from a large and supportive family. That nurtured background,
    along with the rock-solid character built from years of taunting from classmates over her
    appearance and her bathroom habits, had contributed to a steely constitution and a degree
    of common sense which the Swineherds just hadn't been willing to believe could exist in a
    girl. Especially not Penny Syriakis. Conservative in the Greek-American tradition, she'd
    always been rather quiet and had studied hard, and was sure to show up to school dressed
    in the most feminine of styles most days. As she grew older, those beautiful clothes could
    do little to hide the fact that she was growing quite hairy, just like most of the women
    in her family. The boys - and even some girls - had delighted in attacking her for this.
    But however much pain the teasing had caused her privately; she'd merely channeled that
    pain into energy that she spent on cracking the books each night. That fall she'd appeared
    to be heading for the Ivy League and a very bright future indeed.<br>
    <br>
    But that was before that weird, warm, December day. All the students in what was then
    known as Farnham High School had woken up to find the adults gone. Vanished. No sign at
    all of foul play, but not a parent in sight. A few of the kids had elected to stay home
    from school in the absence of any parental supervision; all these months later, it was
    anyone's guess what might have happened to them.<br>
    <br>
    For those who did choose to go to school - about 80% of the student body, apparently - the
    next surprise had arrived as soon as they'd stepped out the door to head to school. It was
    well into winter, and the snow from earlier that week remained on the ground, along with
    the gray skies above. But it was well over seventy degrees outside. No coat necessary, and
    no sign of melting. For the morning, things had proceeded as normally as could be
    expected. But towards lunchtime, it all fell apart. No one except the Swineherds knew just
    what had happened or how long it had been in the works. But there was no escaping the
    results, the Deluge.<br>
    <br>
    At 11:09 AM, the teachers had fallen- all of them. No matter where, in class, at lunch, or
    in the teachers' lounge, each one had simply expired. Panic ensued, with most attention
    focused on the centrally located cafeteria and, naturally, Doug the quarterback. With no
    adults around, the popular Doug was the natural leader in the midst of the catastrophe.
    Probably no more than twenty minutes had passed before he and his buddies had the whole
    student body rounded up in the cafeteria; without fanfare, two of the blockers from the
    football team closed and locked the doors and stood by the exits with their rifles. (Most
    of the football team liked to shoot for sport out of season.)<br>
    <br>
    The truth slowly trickled out to the bewildered mob, which was slowly growing quiet for
    some reason. Doug and a group of his friends, to be known from now on as the Swineherds,
    had captured the principal's office the previous morning and bound, gagged, and frozen
    Mrs. McGlown. A former junior-high civics teacher whom many of the students had studied
    with back in the eighth grade, she was a lovely thirtysomething woman who was beloved
    among the populace ever since taking the reins that September. But she couldn't have cared
    less about football, and unlike the old boys' club her administration replaced, she did
    not favor the boys over the girls. It was unacceptable to Doug and his friends, who'd been
    accustomed to running the school for three years by then, like their brothers before them.<br>
    <br>
    The pieces slowly fell into place for the students. With the kingpin captured and dealt
    with, all authority figures fell. The parents? They were in limbo along with Mrs. McGlown,
    incapacitated by the trickle-down effects of the kidnapping after the kids had gone home
    and spread the school air and its remnants of the unique ether used in the coup around
    their homes. Doug assured everyone that they were quite happy in the netherworld they had
    gone to, and the kids needn't worry.<br>
    <br>
    He then read off two lists comprising the names off all the girls in the school, and had
    them cordoned off into separate parts of the kitchen complex. Unknown to the girls at the
    time, all of the boys not on the Swineherds roster were then marched to the main library,
    issued servant's uniforms, and set to work as servants and laborers throughout the school,
    which was rechristened the &quot;Maxiversity&quot; (short for &quot;maximum
    university&quot;) by Doug.<br>
    <br>
    But that injustice paled in comparison to that which awaited many of the girls. Those that
    were in the good graces of the Swineherds (you couldn't say the Swineherds really liked
    them; they didn't genuinely like any girls) were treated fairly well as long as they
    remained in the guys' good graces. They were allowed full use of the teachers' lounge,
    gym, library and all the other amenities of the school, on the condition that when they
    appeared outside of those restricted-access areas they wore the shabby jumpsuits accorded
    the less-fortunate girls. The lucky few were allowed to wear whatever they liked
    elsewhere, it was explained, but in public the other girls must be prevented from knowing
    which were privileged and which weren't.<br>
    <br>
    Those who weren't privileged - if one could use such a benign term for such an abusive,
    repressive lifestyle - were a surprisingly diverse bunch. The one common thread they all
    had was that sometime in the past, they had all angered one Swineherd or another. No one
    was told just why she was chosen; perhaps it was rebuffing a sexual advance at some party,
    belittling someone in class, turning down a date, or simply saying the wrong thing at some
    point. Whatever their offenses, it was deemed nothing that couldn't be remedied by an
    indefinite sentence of having to go to the bathroom frequently but not being allowed to do
    so very often; wearing nothing but a shapeless, bland jumpsuit everywhere; having all body
    hair removed on a regular basis; and having their femininity shamelessly exploited in any
    way that struck the Swineherds' fancy. It was made abundantly clear to one and all that
    failure to obey the Swineherds would bring fury untold upon the disobedient girl.<br>
    <br>
    Worst of all, each girl would be brainwashed during her &quot;initiation&quot; so that she
    wouldn't know who else was suffering along with her. Due to space limitations, each girl
    would have a cellmate in the darkened dorms - formerly music practice rooms - where they
    would all sleep in the back of the school, but beyond that one other girl, none of the
    victims would be able to recall who else had been herded into that kitchen on that dark
    December day. Too much knowledge is always dangerous in a dictatorship.<br>
    <br>
    Sure enough, Penny recalled nothing about the pig-scene that had ensued in the kitchen
    that day. She didn't recall being forced at gunpoint to remove all her clothes and have
    them locked away along with Mrs. McGlown's dormant body, or being lined up and sent one by
    one into the dishwashing room. No one knew just what had happened there, but every girl
    who emerged was completely hairless below the nape of her neck and had no idea who else
    had been in the kitchen. No, the first thing Penny recalled of her enslavement was being
    led blindfolded into the chemistry lab, where she was belted down onto a table, naked in
    the presence of two Swineherds and a girl she recognized as Angela from chemistry the year
    before. Angela was a science whiz, but she'd slept with most of the football team; there
    wasn't much question to Penny that she wasn't a victim. Spreading Penny's legs, Angela had
    said, &quot;I'm sorry, Penny, they're making me do this.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She'd injected Penny with what turned out to be a local anesthetic, and proceeded to
    assemble a set of six small pouches connected by a plastic tube. Numb from the waist down
    and helpless, Penny had watched as the other girl had stuffed the contraption, one pouch
    at a time, into her vagina. Angela had reached quite deep inside Penny's body, but Penny
    had felt nothing except a minor prick somewhere in there. Later she would learn that she,
    and all the other victims, had been outfitted with what the Swineherds called a
    &quot;secondary bladder.&quot; Stuffed deep inside the girls' wombs, the pouches were
    connected by a catheter into their bladders. Each girl could now hold her water much
    longer than before, but - quite intentionally - she also became much more uncomfortable
    when she did have to go. All the girls were forced to drink large amounts of water each
    morning, but trips to the bathroom were strictly regulated, always supervised, and often
    as long as six hours apart.<br>
    <br>
    The one bit of relief the victims received came at night, when the Swineherds ran bed
    checks. On the principle that those under their control would serve them better with a
    good night's sleep, the Swineherds placed a water-collection unit under each bed and ran a
    tube from the machine inside each girl, to a valve Angela had placed near her cervix. Thus
    all urine went straight into the machine, and for eight hours each night the girls could
    look forward to no urges. The installation was humiliating and not a bit physically
    uncomfortable, but within the first week each and every girl welcomed the procedure.<br>
    <br>
    Every girl, even Penny, who heretofore had never let a boy see her less than fully
    clothed, much less touch her vagina. Modesty just made no sense. And, she'd mused during
    that gloomy first week, modesty was probably what had landed her here in the first place.
    Still quite shy around boys and not especially interested in sex, she never would have
    dated any of the football players. Then there was the fact that she'd been so demure in
    class all those years and took herself so seriously. All that perceived standoffishness,
    not to mention Penny's D-cup breasts, must have given some football player an inferiority
    complex and landed her on the hit list. Now, for never doing any guy a favor, here she was
    expected to drop her clothes at the drop of a hat at any time of day, for any reason, not
    allowed to use the bathroom anywhere near as often as she needed to, and even had to be
    supervised by a boy whenever she was allowed to go. In those heavy first days as she
    worked through her depressing situation, it had never occurred to her to wonder whom else
    shared her misery.<br>
    <br>
    But it hadn't taken long for the brainy girl's natural curiosity to win out over her
    troubling circumstances. Surely all the shy girls like herself were at a very high risk,
    and the ones who weren't afraid to act smart in front of the guys were just about certain
    to be victims. That thought immediately led her to Katie. The &quot;Bird Woman,&quot; as
    Penny had thought of her in the past, was tall and bookish and friendly enough with guys,
    but definitely not the type who'd mess around with the football team. It had taken Penny
    quite some time to track her down in the chaos that had yet to settle throughout the
    Maxiversity, but she'd done it.<br>
    <br>
    Beautiful even in that awful jumpsuit - which was much too small for her 6'1&quot; frame
    so that the crotch of the suit put even more pressure on her bladder - Katie was washing
    dishes in the kitchen, just a bolted door away from where the privileged girls were eating
    lunch. Penny ducked in from the hallway while trying to avoid a Swineherd who had been
    trying to feel her up earlier that morning. Feeling lucky to have made it into the kitchen
    unnoticed, she was overjoyed to discover Katie standing before her after having eluded her
    for all those weeks.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Katie?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The taller girl turned to see Penny hiding behind the bread carts. &quot;Hi...Penny, isn't
    it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Penny nodded. &quot;Right. I need to talk fast. You're another one of us victims, aren't
    you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie immediately turned back to the sink. &quot;I can't talk about that. They'll torture
    us.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;They already are torturing us!&quot; Penny said impatiently. &quot;You are one,
    aren't you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can't talk about it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    But there was no backing down for Penny. &quot;Look, we've got to talk about it. We can
    beat them if we find each other and work together. We've got to.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Katie seemed convinced. &quot;Yes. We've got to. But what can we do? It's been two months
    already and they're getting away with this!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The first thing we need to do is find other girls like us. Let's not worry about
    anything else until we've got a group.&quot; Penny was breathing heavily as she said it.
    Besides needing the bathroom, she had suddenly realized that a Swineherd would probably be
    in any second, looking for her or checking on Katie.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to think about who else would be with us, and which of them can work with
    us.&quot; The taller girl only nodded, so Penny went on. &quot;I have to go before they
    find us. Why don't we meet somewhere tonight, and think about who we can ask in the
    meantime?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Great!&quot; Katie said. &quot;How about the library by the history rooms? Free
    hour?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They both heard someone's footsteps entering the kitchen, so Penny disappeared through the
    same door she'd entered before she could answer Katie. Katie could only hope Penny would
    show up in the history library that night at eight.<br>
    <br>
    The footsteps did belong to a Swineherd, and he'd heard Katie say something or other.
    &quot;Who you talkin' to, cunt?&quot; he asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Myself,&quot; Katie answered, blinking back tears. Growing up in an all-female
    household since the age of five that was one word she'd never thought she'd have to answer
    to. &quot;It keeps me from getting bored when I'm washing dishes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't,&quot; he'd answered, stepping up so close behind her that she could feel his
    breath on her upper back. &quot;You don't need to worry about bored.&quot; With that, he
    reached around her front and cupped both hands over her breasts. &quot;That ain't one
    thing you need to worry about.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    After he'd had his fill, he went back to the dining room, leaving Katie to go over the
    dialogue with Penny and hope she'd heard everything. &quot;Free hour&quot; was from eight
    to nine each night, the one time when the girls and the male prisoners were left to their
    own devices - in separate wings of the building, of course - with minimal supervision
    while most of the Swineherds were busy with more important things. It would be a long day
    for Katie until then.<br>
