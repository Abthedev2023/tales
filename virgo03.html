    <br>
    <br>
    This is another little vignette that takes place in ca 1930 at the vast, pastoral estate
    in England known as Bish Manor.<br>
    <br>
    We begin with Derrick, a tall, thin, respectable no-nonsense type. He was a handsome
    gentleman, and was avidly involved in the social circles, attended all the parties, and
    kept himself at all times blithe and charming. After all, one never knew where one's
    future fiancée might be lurking, and marrying well was an object most sought after by his
    crowd.<br>
    <br>
    He thereby began his day, an outing to Bish Manor, with a bright and innocent temperament.
    There was nothing more on his mind but than to get nicely sloshed, play a little cricket
    outdoors with the fellows, have a good cigar and do a spot of flirting- nothing really, of
    extraordinary interest.<br>
    <br>
    There were several of them in the party that day, including several girls, but Derrick
    himself was without a date. Most of the ladies tagging along were already engaged to their
    corresponding fellows, including one, Madolyn, whom Derrick found to be most interesting.<br>
    <br>
    Madolyn was engaged to his friend Oscar, and although Oscar was along that day, he
    actually paid his Madolyn very little attention. The first half of the day the party was
    spent entirely outdoors, only a few of their crowd owned automobiles, and so they had
    taken the couple of vehicles they had and gone joyriding. The champagne flowed, the boys
    passed around those new illicit cigarettes they were smoking at that time in the jazz
    clubs in America, and everybody was behaving with mischief, trying their best to shed the
    hindrances of their repressed British upbringing.<br>
    <br>
    Derrick noticed that for most of the morning, Madolyn kept to herself, only smiling
    prettily and answering questions politely only when she was asked. Derrick, in his haste
    to forget himself in the festivities, wrote her off merely as a poor sport and though he
    did like her, directed his attention elsewhere for the remainder of the morning.<br>
    <br>
    A bit later they all piled into the cars to head back to the estate for a late lunch. The
    ride itself took nearly an hour; they had been out all day, since ten. It was now close to
    two. They rode back in two cars, and Derrick lost company with Oscar and Madolyn, so was
    speaking to the driver of the second car, his friend Reginald, as they drove.<br>
    <br>
    He did not see Madolyn again until they reached the house. He was in the second car that
    arrived and soon realized, as he lit a cigarette and stretched, that the others were being
    shepherded straight away down a stone path laid on either side with topiary that wound to
    the back of the house and toward one of the rear entrances that presumably led to the
    dining room. Derrick, at a leisurely pace, began to follow. He was of course as hungry as
    the rest of them, but he thought it unseemly to appear in too much of a hurry simply for
    food. He took his time. He reached a series of steps that led up toward the massive
    wrought iron glass doors that for the moment were standing open. He could see the rest of
    the gang ahead, disappearing into the light and shadows of the house. At the top of the
    landing, just before the doors, he decided to finish his cigarette.<br>
    <br>
    He had just raised the thing to his lips, when, to his right over his shoulder, he caught
    a glimpse or just the impression rather of somebody else there, standing just outside the
    entrance, partially obscured by a couple of tall plants.<br>
    <br>
    He turned, his face curious. It was Madolyn. She was standing perfectly still, looking
    away from him. For some reason, her posture struck him as odd. With an expression
    approaching a scowl, he pitched his cigarette to the ground and began to walk toward the
    door to join the others.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn, I say...come on, old thing, I don't know about you, but I'm
    ravenous...&quot; He said this without really having looked directly at her, but
    nevertheless, once he reached the door, he realized she had not moved. He stopped, his
    hand on the gate, and looked back.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn...?&quot; he asked. He barely caught a glimpse of her face. After
    meeting his eye for only the briefest possible instant, she shut her eyes tightly and
    turned away, the ribbon on her hat catching the sunlight. DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn...?&quot;
    he called again, stepping closer. His face was curious and a bit concerned, for the first
    time thinking that something might actually be wrong.<br>
    <br>
    She merely stood there, rigid, her shoulders tense, her face turned away, her handbag and
    a lacy handkerchief clutched to her chest like a strap of schoolbooks.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Is something the matter, dear girl, come along, we ought to join the
    others...&quot; He reached for her hand.<br>
    <br>
    MADOLYN: &quot;Oh! Derrick!&quot; She gasped sharply. &quot;I... can't! I... c-can't
    MOVE!&quot; Her whisper was fierce. Derrick was understandably bewildered. Female tantrum,
    he supposed.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Nonsense, girl...&quot; he managed to get a hold of her hand. &quot;Now
    come along, 'can't move,' what's the matter with you...&quot; he muttered, beginning to
    feel a trifle annoyed with her. He tugged on her arm; just firmly enough to indicate that
    he meant business.<br>
    <br>
    Her hand shot out and grabbed his forearm very tightly, wrenching the fabric of his suit.<br>
    <br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    He looked at her. He looked her up and down. Her eyes were still screwed closed, her lips
    parted, breathing in short gasps. She lifted one of her feet, coiled it around her ankle,
    and bent ever so slightly at the waist, as if she'd just been dealt a mild blow to her
    stomach.<br>
    <br>
    MADOLYN: &quot;mmmmnnnngghhhh...!&quot; she made a tiny, frantic sound.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly awareness so secretive and so private and so painful hit him so strongly and so
    definitely, that for an instant he felt as if the world had disappeared from beneath his
    feet.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn... Madolyn, do you... do you have to go to the toilet, is that
    it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He heard himself ask in a whisper, not bothering to select more lady-appropriate
    terminology. But as soon as he'd asked, he almost felt silly. There really wasn't a shadow
    of a doubt. He KNEW. It wasn't merely her posture or her desperate noises; it was rather
    like he had suddenly become attuned to some very specific human telepathy. Her panic was
    so furious it seemed downright contagious. All at once, Derrick felt sharply ashamed and
    embarrassed himself. All in the span of no more than a second, he became consciously aware
    of a number of things: First, his mortification at having found himself a part of so
    delicate a situation, and second, much to his displeasure, a most distinct shot of
    impatience- impatience, exasperation and anger. And, knowing he had no fair call to feel
    such things, (after all, there comes similar times of crisis for everyone), but he was
    aware of some anger. Knowing he had no right to that anger merely added to his shame.<br>
    <br>
    But most intriguing of all was the undeniable rush of sexual excitement, the strangest
    flavor of arousal Derrick had ever tasted. It was all-consuming, the level of excitement
    he was able to derive at once from the realization of the scenario was such that it
    disturbed him immensely.<br>
    <br>
    But, all of this occurred to him in the span of no more than a second. Madolyn had not yet
    answered the question posed her. She seemed presumably paralyzed. She'd claimed she
    couldn't move. Judging by her agonized behavior, he believed her. But obviously she was
    going to HAVE to move- and the sooner the better.<br>
    <br>
    She contorted herself again, bending more severely but very slowly at the waist, again,
    making a whimpering, pleading sound. (&quot;DO something!!&quot;) She seemed to implore.
    Derrick struggled to force all his Freudian hindrances from his mind. He shook his head as
    if to clear them out. He had to make a FAST decision. And she was obviously beyond the
    point of coherent action or ideas. It was up to him.<br>
    <br>
    He took a quick look over both shoulders, he took her other hand, all at once completely
    certain about one thing: Something told him NOT to take her into the house. Something told
    him they would never make it, not in that monstrosity of a place; they would never make it
    as far as the first corridor. And he knew the place; it was full of exotic carpets and
    highly polished floors. No, he decided on his course of action straight away. He put one
    arm around her thin, trembling shoulders, and, trying to sound reassuring, simply said,
    &quot;come on...&quot; and began to pull her toward the steps back down to the garden.<br>
    <br>
    She fought his efforts and practically squatted in order to remain in the same spot.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn, come along! Now!&quot; He jerked her upright and pushed her ahead.<br>
    <br>
    With a sound approaching a small, frightened sob, she somehow managed to attain some sense
    of balance, and knowing deep down she really WAS going to have to move a few steps in one
    direction or another sooner or later, with a massive effort she found herself finally able
    to follow along beside him. He kept his arm tight around her shoulders as he led her. He
    led her more briskly than slowly, down the few steps that led to the back entrance, and
    onto the cobblestone path and back the way they had come through the garden.<br>
    <br>
    Several times during their short walk she froze and refused to take another step. Another
    time she'd tried to crouch down to the path, but Derrick was too strong for her, and,
    knowing time was crucial, managed each time to force her back upright and kept her
    walking. (Amazingly, had he truly known her state)<br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, he found &quot;the spot,&quot; just on the other side of an ornate concrete
    garden wall, in a slight recess, surrounded by some trees and rosebushes. The cobblestones
    by the wall were cold, red and dry.<br>
    <br>
    Still exercising as much authority and &quot;take-charge&quot; as he was able, he led
    Madolyn's shuddering form to the part of the wall furthest away from the path.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;All right...&quot; he whispered, as he stood away from her, his voice
    serious. She stood, her back flat against the stone recess of the garden wall, her handbag
    around her arm, staring about the place with horrified, anguished eyes, never having had
    to urinate so badly in her entire life.<br>
    <br>
    She did not move. Derrick took a step toward her.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn, honestly!&quot; he whispered, trembling himself, although he was
    not sure why. She began to cry. She shook her head. She began to contort even more
    painfully, more busily, her need a shearing agony. She practically worked herself into a
    knot trying to contain the deluge of angry, long-held water inside of her. Her white
    nostrils flared with her panicked breath. She cried. But she wouldn't do it. She was
    bursting, painfully, and she wouldn't do it.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, good lord. Derrick thought, fully exasperated with womanliness- one of those, who for
    some reason- won't take one's relief out of doors. He shook his head and tried to think.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn....&quot; he whispered urgently, warning her that she simply MUST
    do as she was told. She shook her head again and began to slump against the wall, almost
    as if she were trying to disappear. Derrick didn't know what to do.<br>
    <br>
    Instinct took over yet again. Without a second thought, he stepped directly over to her.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Oh, for pity's sake...&quot; With a sigh of exasperation as one makes in
    dealing with a stubborn child, Derrick reached down, grabbed the hem of her burgundy skirt
    and pulled it to her waist, forcing the hunk of fabric in her hands. Her legs exposed, she
    buried her face in her handkerchief out of embarrassment. With her skirt raised, as she
    was, standing, Derrick crouched before her.<br>
    <br>
    He took no particular notice of her shoes, her dark stockings, or her topaz satin garters.
    But he was quite frankly dumbstruck when he glanced up to her beautiful satin knickers.
    They matched her garters. Or had. The entire front panel of the garment was soaking wet-
    almost black in contrast to the intended smoky gold color surrounding it.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;...good lord...&quot; he gasped. Her panties were wet. Clear up to the
    tummy, her panties, her underthings, they... they were all wet. She must have been,
    well... spurting little bits of water for God knows HOW long before he intervened. He
    could barely believe the sight of it. His shameful excitement rose tremendously. Madolyn
    was clearly at the end of her rope.<br>
    <br>
    Acting purely by blind compulsion, Derrick reached up and with very little finesse
    practically tore her underwear down to her knees. The fabric was hot and squelched a
    little between his fingers. In the next instant, he took her by the wrist and with
    considerable force, pulled her down to a crouching position, still working her wet
    underwear down to her calves and finally over her ankles, where he managed to pull them
    free and toss them aside.<br>
    <br>
    Now.<br>
    <br>
    There was nothing to stop her. He crouched, squatting in front of her, looking straight at
    her. She kept her face buried in her handkerchief, and though ready with regard to
    position and secluded as she could hope to have been, still, she resisted. She shuddered
    violently, holding onto Derrick's shoulder for balance, her ankles wobbling on the cold
    cobblestone beneath her.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Madolyn...&quot; he whispered, as if she needed reminding she was there.
    She shook her head again.<br>
    <br>
    And then it happened.<br>
    <br>
    The girl's bladder, after struggling so long to contain its contents, finally collapsed
    under the labor, and the torrent of urine that shot forward was, quite literally, the
    fastest, hardest, most copious and by far the most forceful first blast of a person's
    water that Derrick had ever seen in his entire life. She did not so much stream or even
    shoot so as she sprayed, she splattered. Like a bloody fire brigade, with such a frenzied
    urgency, Derrick could barely believe his eyes, but the silver-clear liquid actually
    foamed as it hit the ground. The thick, chattering stream was so powerful it shot forward
    further than Derrick anticipated, even spattering the tops of his shoes. It came in long,
    surging pulses of varying strength. The puddle on the stones pooled out around their feet.
    It was impossible to get out of the way. Derrick felt he could do nothing but hold her
    steady while she had it out. At one point, the stream seemed to him to be tapering off
    just a bit, but no sooner had he guessed that, than another strong, pulsing current poured
    from between her legs, arcing so far in front of her that Derrick actually caught quite a
    healthy splash of it over the cuff of his trousers. He immediately shifted his foot out of
    the way, feeling the hot liquid seep into his sock.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;...hah...s-steady on...&quot; he whispered, his heart pounding. He licked
    his lips. His penis was so stiff it was increasingly uncomfortable merely to maintain his
    position. He held onto her shoulders and glanced down. The puddle was nearly three feet in
    every direction. The last time Derrick could ever remember witnessing a creature relieve
    itself so fantastically had been when was fourteen and seen a bull elephant passing water
    at the zoo. But for a scrap of a girl like Madolyn! It was.... so carnal, so... base. He
    felt the most potent, bizarre mix of embarrassment and arousal he could ever in all his
    years remember.<br>
    <br>
    He felt dizzy. He told himself to keep his head however. Looked down at the gradually
    culminating business between them, took a deep breath, and the stream began to taper to
    dribbles and slashes, he sighed.<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;... there now...&quot; he said, trying to keep his voice calm, outwardly.
    He slowly released her, convinced she was finished or very nearly, and turned out of
    respect for her privacy, knowing she would want to dry herself.<br>
    <br>
    He took a step or two toward the edge of the wall and looked back to the house. They would
    surely be missed soon. He reached into his pocket for a cigarette and tried consciously to
    stow away his erection before turning to face his friend's fiancée again. He would have
    been mortified if she'd guessed he'd taken pleasure in her wretched, personally desperate
    state.<br>
    <br>
    After a moment or two of silence she took his hand.<br>
    <br>
    MADOLYN: &quot;thank you...&quot; she sniffled. &quot;Please don't tell Oscar...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    DERRICK: &quot;Oh, pish. Not a bit of it, my dear, it'll be our secret.&quot;<br>
