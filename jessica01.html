    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was at a cocktail party to say
    goodbye to the graduating seniors, as I am a sophomore history major.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of my professors were there and it was really
    important to make a good impression, as they would be writing my recommendation letters in
    the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I dressed in a conservative blouse
    with tight gray matching pants and jacket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    looked conservative but good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way
    there I drank a bottle of water, as it was quite hot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I didn't worry about having to go to the bathroom, as I knew I could go
    there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I got there I began talking to
    one of my Profs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He offered me a glass of
    apple juice and I didn't want to refuse, so I took it and drank it while we talked.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I walked around the room, one of my best
    friends and graduating seniors insisted I drink a glass of champagne with him, as this was
    a celebration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I did, and as I finished my
    bladder came calling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was about to go to
    the little girls' room, when another of my Profs took me aside and began introducing me to
    people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the liquid was coming on STRONG.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I began shifting uncomfortably and crossing one
    leg in front of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to get to
    the bathroom fast. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But they kept talking and talking
    and talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no way I could excuse
    myself, as these people were all faculty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    sat nodding and smiling, the whole time in a panic, as I could feel the urine pushing to
    escape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I thought it couldn't get any worse
    when they announced, &quot;everyone take your seats it's time for speeches!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My professor asked me to sit with him.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse, he was sitting right at the front!<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I sat down and immediately crossed my legs as
    tight as I could, placing my hand under the table for a quick squeeze.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the first speech began I was
    almost in tears, it hurt so bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My legs were
    shaking and twitching and people began to give me funny looks. There's no way I could get
    up in the middle of the speech I thought, but if I could just wait it out I could then go
    in between speeches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My palms were sweating
    and I was wringing my hands together desperately, trying everything to hold on.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as the speech was winding down and I thought
    I might make it, someone at the table poured water into a glass.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sound of that water splashing into the glass
    caused me to momentarily lose control, squirting for three seconds into my tight gray
    pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I whispered, &quot;shit&quot; and
    grabbed my crotch under the table, feeling the moistness in my pants.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was now sitting with my thighs pressed against
    each other, and both hands under the table pressing up against my crotch. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally the speech ended, and I
    quickly got up to sprint to the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    as I got up my bladder momentarily weakened, causing another 3-second spurt into my pants,
    making a very noticeable mark down my inner thigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
    at the table looked at me, and all I could say was &quot;I really must go to the bathroom,
    now!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one said anything and I
    sprinted toward the restroom, with one hand still in my crotch.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to run through the whole room, and everyone
    saw me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I thought my desperation would
    finally come to an end and then I saw a three-person line to get into the women's
    bathroom. I hopped from foot to foot while crossing and uncrossing my legs, doing anything
    to avoid totally peeing my pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The person
    in front of me went in and stayed in there for what seemed like an eternity.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was completely panicking, tears streaming down
    my face as I held onto my pussy for dear life.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What
    was she doing in there?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I heard the water faucet come on,
    the mixture of excitement that she was almost done and hearing water splashing caused me
    to totally lose control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There I was, at a
    cocktail party, urine streaming down my pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    finally gained control after about 10 seconds, but it didn't matter.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My pants were completely soaked.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I went in and peed the rest out.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I looked in the mirror at my soaked pants.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wet stains extending from the crotch down both
    thighs and soaking my socks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Great, now
    what am I going to do?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I walked out of the bathroom, two other
    sophomores with whom I didn't get along began pointing and laughing hysterically.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All I could do was walk quickly out
    of the room and to my car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I let out some
    more in the car, soaking my ass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one spoke
    of that day again, at least to me, but everyone surely remembers.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
