      Bladder problems! Not something that I'd ever experienced and something 
      to joke about with friends - who do sometimes admit to embarrassing leaks 
      when laughing or coughing or in a couple of cases not quite making it home 
      from the pub in time! I always found these confessions rather amusing as I 
      did the Tena adverts on TV - I could not believe that all these people wet 
      themselves or needed 'protection' to keep their knickers dry. That someone 
      might enjoy wetting their pants or even their bed was unbelievable. But 
      then it happened - totally unexpected, very embarrassing (at the time) but 
      ultimately amazing.<br><br>Perhaps some background is in order. I'm Rachel, and no spring chicken 
      being in my late 40's though I've kept quite a trim figure, married and 
      with two children who have at last left home after university. Despite two 
      pregnancies I have a good pelvic floor and usually a very strong bladder. 
      Although I've always enjoyed a good sex life with my husband having two 
      young adults in the house was rather offputting and despite now having the 
      house to ourselves sex has remained irregular and dare I say it, rather 
      boring and as a result I had become a bit frustrated. Not any more though. 
      <br><br>So back to the main event. It all began with a girly night out while my 
      husband was away on business. Although it started off with serious 
      intentions we ended up in the pub as usual and though I don't usually 
      drink much I did get rather carried away this time. By late evening we 
      were dashing off to the loo every twenty minutes or so and with all the 
      joking and laughter the usual suspects in our group had already disgraced 
      themselves so they said, much to the amusement of those of us with proper 
      self control. Karen in particular clearly had a problem and when she 
      dashed to the loo after a particularly raucous laugh had a very obvious 
      wet patch on the back of her fawn skirt, not that she seemed concerned or 
      had even noticed it, which rather surprised me.<br><br>By the time we decided to head home I was, unusually for me, rather 
      drunk. Normally I stick to a couple of glasses of wine and soft drinks but 
      the pub had been having a cider festival so we all sampled rather more 
      than we originally intended. Cider of course does tend to go right through 
      you hence our frequent trips to the ladies. Anyway, we paid one last visit 
      and headed for the taxi rank. It took a while to get a cab and by the time 
      we did I needed a wee yet again and I wasn't the only one. Fortunately the 
      journey was only fifteen minutes or so and as we live close to each other 
      decided to all go to Sharon's place and walk the rest of the way, a 
      further five minutes in my case.<br><br>We piled out of the cab, said our rather prolonged goodbyes and headed 
      for our homes. By this time I really needed the loo quite badly and 
      considered asking to use Sharon's toilet but Karen, who lives in my street 
      was in a hurry to get home so we walked off before I could ask. Hardly had 
      we turned the corner when Karen blurted out that she was so desperate for 
      a wee it was almost running down her leg. I laughingly reminded her that 
      it was rather obvious that she had already had one accident tonight, for 
      some weird reason saying that another wouldn't make much difference. Karen 
      just felt her bottom, giggling that she hadn't realised it was that bad 
      and in which case there was no point hanging on when she was bursting, 
      even if we were nearly home. With that she stopped in her tracks, spread 
      her legs slightly and just wet herself! I stood there incredulous as a 
      torrent poured down her leg and a huge puddle spread round her feet and 
      ran towards the gutter. I don't think I had ever witnessed another mature 
      woman lose control of herself like this and could hardly believe what I 
      was seeing, yet Karen seemed totally unconcerned at what she had just 
      done. Seeing the look of horror on my face though she began to apologise 
      profusely, saying she had been so desperate she just could not hold on. I 
      simply said that I understood and that we had better get her home. Yet my 
      mind was in a whirl at what I had witnessed and most curiously I was 
      strangely aroused. I was also even more desperate for a wee than ever 
      after seing her relief and was increasingly in danger of having an 
      accident myself.<br><br>We reached Karen's front door and I helped her find her key, taking a 
      lingering look at her wet skirt and legs in the light from the hallway, 
      still intrigued by the sight of a grown woman who had wet herself, 
      apparently deliberately. She apologised again and asked me not to say 
      anything to the others, adding that she had better go and change before 
      her husband got home.<br><br>A final quick goodbye and I headed as fast as I could for home, about 
      200 metres away in a small close at the end of the main street. I was 
      absolutely bursting by now and my usually iron control was really being 
      tested. A couple of times I even had to stop to squeeze my thighs together 
      and even hold myself - but I was still dry.<br><br>Finally I reached my front door but then the key wouldn't fit! In a 
      panic I kept trying it, not helped by my rather drunken state and aching 
      bladder until I realised that I had picked up the back door key by 
      mistake. By now I was absolutely frantic for the loo, crossing my legs and 
      bouncing up and down like a silly teenager, even openly holding myself but 
      I still had to get indoors. Hobbling to the side gate to the garden I had 
      to stretch up to reach over the top to slide the bolt.<br><br>That did it - I leaked! A steady dribble of wee spread a warm wetness 
      in my pants and try as I might I just could not stop it. Pushing the gate 
      shut I tried to shuffle the three steps to the door, key in hand. But it 
      was already too late. With each step a hot jet of wee escaped, straight 
      through my knickers and tights and running down my leg. In panic, and 
      confusion I put the key in the lock but as the door opened all semblance 
      of control left me. Before I could move my bladder just gave up and a 
      torrent of wee poured out, filling my knickers, streaming in rivers down 
      my legs, filling my shoes and forming a huge puddle on the step. The 
      impossible had happened!<br><br>My mind was in turmoil. I was flushed with embarrassment and feelings 
      of horror that I, of all people was wetting myself. There were other 
      feelings too. The surprise at losing control, amazement at how hot it felt 
      on my skin, how wet it felt and of course the overwhelming relief from 
      releasing a bursting bladder. Then there was the surprisingly pleasant, 
      even arousing feeling between my legs, the warmth and tickling sensation 
      washing over my private parts, my soaking knickers against my skin and the 
      warmth down my legs. I seemed to wee for ever, the feelings of exquisite 
      relief increasing exponentially until out of the blue an incredible orgasm 
      overwhelmed me.<br><br>As my bladder finally drained I just stood there trembling, wee still 
      dripping down my legs and from the back of my skirt, completely unable to 
      move and almost in shock at what had just happened. I stood there unable 
      to move for what seemed an age but was probably no more than a minute 
      until I composed myself and went indoors. For some reason I took off my 
      shoes and rinsed them in the kitchen sink before leaving them to dry by 
      the back door, hung my jacket over the back of a chair before, still in a 
      haze, I stumbled upstairs.<br><br>On the landing I caught sight of myself in the full-length mirror and 
      paused to see what I looked like. Wet streaks were visible down my grey 
      tights and the back of my skirt had a huge wet patch that broadened along 
      the hem. It was pretty obvious, had anyone been looking, that I had well 
      and truly wet myself. I'm not sure why but I undid my skirt and let it 
      drop to the floor so that I was standing in just my underwear and blouse, 
      fascinated by the wet stains on my knickers and legs.<br><br>Intrigued, I inspected the damage. I was wearing silky pale blue 
      knickers, grey tights plus a pair of fawn Sloggi control briefs to keep my 
      tights up (and tummy in). The Sloggis were wet in the gusset, half way up 
      my bottom at the back and part way up the front while my tights were 
      soaked down my inner thighs and mainly down the back of my legs. All the 
      while watching myself in the mirror I ran my hand over my wet bottom and 
      thighs, still warm and very wet. Then I felt between my legs. The result 
      was electric - my clit was throbbing and despite the orgasm when my 
      bladder burst I just wanted to come again.<br><br>Stumbling into my bedroom I threw back the duvet, pulled my control 
      briefs and tights down to my knees, lay down with my legs apart and rubbed 
      myself through my soaking satin knickers, enthralled by the incredible 
      feeling of warm wet and slippery material massaging my most sensitive 
      places. Never had masturbation felt so good. Then I came. A shuddering 
      orgasm ripple through me, better than I had had in ages. I cried out in 
      pleasure as my body released its pent up tensions, feeling a new hot 
      wetness in my knickers and under my bottom as my bladder let me down for a 
      second time. I'd wet my pants and now I'd wet my bed but at that moment I 
      just didn't care.<br><br>Exhausted (and still rather drunk) I lay back and must have gone to 
      sleep as the next thing I knew was being awoken by the ache of a bursting 
      bladder and with a throbbing head. In my groggy state I could not 
      understand why my pants, bottom and the sheet felt damp, nor, as I tried 
      to get out of bed, why my tights were still half on. As I came round I 
      began to remember what had happened, initial feelings of embarrassment and 
      disgust fading as I recalled the wonderful orgasms. I lay back again, 
      thinking about those feelings for a while, just trying to make sense of it 
      all. I'd wet myself, something that I had never done before, indeed the 
      very idea of it horrified me yet it had aroused me like nothing else for 
      years.<br><br>Then I felt a twinge in my now desperate bladder and instinctively 
      rubbed myself, finding my knickers still damp yet strangely comfortable. 
      My clit responded to my touch and I began to gently caress myself again, 
      waves of pleasure washing over me. As I rubbed myself little dribbles and 
      spurts of pee warmed my knickers and trickled down my bottom, the feeling 
      adding to my pleasure. Suddenly the trickles became a torrent as my 
      bladder released, a hot flood spreading round my bottom further soaking 
      the already wet sheet. As the flood died away my orgasm enveloped me. I 
      was in ecstasy.<br><br>I lay back, totally sated and must have fallen asleep again as when I 
      came round again it was daylight. Throwing back the duvet I slowly got out 
      of bed, curious about and also fearful of the state of the bed. I was 
      soaked from head to foot - my knickers clung to me as did the blouse I had 
      not taken off, while a massive wet stain covered much of the bottom sheet. 
      The duvet and cover were also damp. A day earlier I would have been 
      mortified and absolutely disgusted with myself if I had merely leaked in 
      my pants and I think I would have died of shame had I wet my bed. But I 
      didn't feel any of this - I'd wet my pants and my bed in the same night 
      yet I didn't care. In fact I wanted to enjoy those lovely feelings again 
      but first some washing was required!<br><br>I stripped the bed with some trepidation as to the state of my 
      mattress. The quilted top cover was dripping wet but fortuitously had a 
      waterproof backing and the anti-allergy cover (dust mites make my asthma 
      worse) was dry, and, when I checked also waterproof. This was a real 
      relief as I did not want to have to explain a wet mattress to my husband 
      when he got home the next day. As it was the washing machine had to work 
      overtime!<br><br>However, I still had the rest of Sunday to myself and I have to admit 
      that I did indulge in my new pleasure once again that afternoon. I dressed 
      as I had the previous evening drank a lot of tea and let, myself become 
      desperate again, dashing into the wet room just as I began to lose control 
      and thrilling again to the feeling of the hot wetness in my knickers and 
      down my legs.<br><br><br>Work and my husband's imminent return put paid to further exploration 
      and I was certainly not yet ready to confide in Peter or have an accident 
      in front of him as I was terrified of an adverse reaction. That would have 
      to wait but I was really looking forward to his next business trip when I 
      would have private time to explore my new pleasures.<br></span><br><br><strong>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;Poseidon</strong><br><br>
