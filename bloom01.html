    <br>
    Joe was a good guy, an older friend always willing to take some risks on our behalf. He
    said he'd be glad to pick up a case of beer for us. We were all under 21 and too young to
    buy beer in the state where we lived in the Northeastern United States.<br>
    <br>
    At the senior prom dance that June evening in the mid-1950s, I danced only with Maddy, a
    girl I'd been going with for about a year. We were kindred spirits, similar interests, but
    where I was shy and retiring, she was bubbly and outgoing. I was very comfortable with
    her. She drew me out and helped me overcome my shyness. However, we never had sex.<br>
    <br>
    Charlie and Lisa, Phil and Marge, and Maddy and I left the prom about 11 p.m. and piled
    into Charlie's 1954 Mercury and drove to Joe's house to pick up the beer. Charlie was the
    senior member of the group at 19. The rest of us were 18. Charlie drove into Joe's garage
    as prearranged so we could load the beer in the Mercury's trunk unobserved. We removed 12
    cans and brought them inside the car and scattered them around the seats and floor.<br>
    <br>
    Charlie backed out of Joe's garage and headed for the rural roads outside of town. A can
    opener (this was before tab tops) was passed around and six pops and fizzes were heard.
    Bill Haley and the Comets blared on the radio. It was 1950's America - a &quot;simpler
    time&quot;, the Eisenhower years. But it was also a time of fear - fear of the Red Menace,
    nuclear war, and getting drafted. The conversation was animated but meandering. In my
    usual shyness, I listened but remained mostly silent.<br>
    <br>
    Uninhibited Maddy was the first to announce she had to pee. The other two girls quickly
    expressed the same need. Although each was only on her first beer, the girls, unaccustomed
    to alcohol, were already getting giggly. &quot;You're shittin' me,&quot; said Charlie.
    &quot;You're still on your first beer. Jesus, what amateurs!&quot; Nonetheless, he pulled
    over by a hedge-lined field and we all piled out.<br>
    <br>
    Maddy just spread her legs and proceeded to pee in the soft gravel by the side of the
    road, spattering mud over her shoes and ankles. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; cried
    Lisa. &quot;Aren't you wearing panties?&quot; &quot;Sure I am,&quot; said Maddy, &quot;but
    I'll be damned if I'm going to drop them here.&quot; Lisa and Marge conferred briefly,
    then both decided to follow Maddy's example. Lisa stood, but Marge chose to squat,
    carefully spreading her dress around her to avoid getting it wet.<br>
    <br>
    We three guys were surprised to say the least. Charlie seemed disgusted, Phil amused. I
    stared, transfixed. Fortunately, I was wearing tight briefs that concealed my fast-growing
    erection. Phil insisted the girls show us their panties. I overcame my shyness to second
    the motion. There was some resistance at first, but once again, bold Maddy, even more
    uninhibited than usual thanks to the beer, stood directly in the headlights and raised her
    dress, thrusting her pelvis forward. A large wet spot, faintly yellow, was plainly visible
    in her crotch, causing the fabric of her full-cut, white cotton panties to cling and
    reveal the shape her pudendum and the darkness of hair. Girls didn't shave that area in
    the 50's.<br>
    <br>
    Following Maddy's lead, the other two girls stood facing the headlights and lifted their
    dresses. Lisa's pink panties had a small wet patch in the crotch. She was wearing a garter
    belt and nylons, and the stockings were plainly pee-streaked. No wetness was visible in
    Marge's light blue panties. &quot;You didn't pee,&quot; accused Phil. &quot;I did
    so,&quot; said Marge. &quot;Well I can't see anything,&quot; retorted Phil. &quot;How
    about this?&quot; asked Marge. She turned her back to the headlights, lifted her dress
    high and bent forward. The entire seat of her panties was wet, clinging to her shapely
    butt, the wet fabric sinking into her crack.<br>
    <br>
    We three guys then stepped into the concealment of the hedges, unzipped and began to
    relieve ourselves. There were hoots and taunts from the girls, who threatened to charge
    into the hedges and peek. They didn't.<br>
    <br>
    We all got back in the car and Charlie drove on. I was on one end of the back seat, Maddy
    in the middle and Phil on the other end, absorbed in a private conversation with Marge in
    the front seat. Lisa was seated in front between Charlie and Marge. These were the days of
    6-passenger cars, with ample room for 3 in front and 3 in back. &quot;I smell piss,&quot;
    said Charlie. &quot;That stink better not stick.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I worked up the nerve to whisper a request in Maddy's ear. &quot;Could I feel your
    panties?&quot; I asked. To my surprise, she acceded. She spread her legs slightly and
    raised her dress just to her crotch line. I slipped my hand between her smooth legs and
    gently fondled her cool wet crotch. I could feel the folds of her labia. She moaned
    slightly. I was in a fever pitch, my erection now becoming painful as it strained against
    the fabric of my briefs.<br>
    <br>
    We rolled along the rural roads in the warm evening, windows open, while I continued to
    fondle Maddy's wet crotch. The girls became teary-eyed when Mark Dinning crooned
    &quot;Teen Angel&quot; on the radio.<br>
    <br>
    <em>&quot;Just sweet 16, and now you're gone<br>
    They've taken you away<br>
    I can no longer kiss your lips<br>
    They buried you today&quot;</em><br>
    <br>
    Near the end of her second beer, Maddy needed to pee again. With much grumbling, Charlie
    pulled over. Maddy climbed over Phil and out the door and once again stood spread-legged
    and let go on the side of the road. She climbed back in and flopped beside me. This time
    with no prodding, she slung one leg across my lap and lifted her dress high. A fresh wet
    patch now spread high in front of her delightful soft cotton panties. I felt it. It was
    still warm. I ran my hand down her leg, smooth and slippery with pee.<br>
    <br>
    Conversation began to slow, fatigue took over, only half the beer had been consumed, and
    we all decided to call it a night. Maddy was the first to be dropped off at her house. I
    got out of the car to let her out and watched her walk toward her front door. Her father
    frowned on young men walking her to the door. She walked slightly spread-legged as though
    her wet panties were starting to chafe. The rest of us were driven to our homes. Charlie
    was going to return the remaining beer to Joe's garage and go home himself. Denial of
    sexual release left me with the soreness and tenderness in my testicles we called
    &quot;blueballs.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The wetting incident was the subject of my masturbation fantasies for months after. Maddy
    and I continued to see each other for about a year and then tapered off. Our relationship
    was pure '50s - sweet and innocent. She never wet herself for me again. It would be
    another five years before I finally lost my virginity. It was not with Maddy.<br>
    <br>
    I soon lost my wetting fetish and it didn't surface again for more than 40 years. It came
    back in a rush when I stumbled upon wetting sites on the Internet. However, to say it
    revived only a fetish would be trivializing it. It brought back a time and a place - guys
    I bonded with, the fragrance, musical voices and bubbly laughter of girls who seemed to
    ooze femaleness from their very pores, rocking to Bill Haley, becoming misty-eyed to
    &quot;Teen Angel,&quot; an era and attitudes that now live only in memory.<br>
