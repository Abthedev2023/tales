    <br>
    Backstory: This story is loosely based on true events. Names have been changed.<br>
    <br>
    Maria Zellar is a thin girl, very geeky, but also quite attractive at the age of eighteen.
    Her dark, brown hair contrasts her pale skin very nicely, and her glasses compliment her
    face. She also has very large breasts for someone so thin.<br>
    <br>
    Today Maria's senior class was on a field trip to the Natural History Museum. Her class
    had arrived in town at around 11:00am, and it was now 3:50. It was nearing time to leave,
    but Maria didn't even notice because she was so enthralled by the exhibits. She had been
    walking around a lot today, visiting all the shops in town and touring the museum, and so
    she had been drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. She had also been so preoccupied
    with shopping and the museum that she had neglected to use the bathroom at all. She hadn't
    gone since she woke up at 8:00 that morning. Maria's need to use the bathroom was now
    getting noticeable, but she didn't want to stop looking at the exhibits in the museum. She
    was admiring the mounted polar bear display when she heard the teacher calling the
    students to gather outside. &quot;Time to leave! Everyone get out here right now!&quot;
    called Ms. Fleischer, Maria's cranky English teacher who was chaperoning the trip.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Better use the bathroom real quick,&quot; thought Maria. She started to make her way
    over to the bathrooms, but Ms. Fleischer saw her and grabbed her arm. &quot;We're already
    running late, come on now, we have to leave,&quot; she told Maria. &quot;I just need to
    use the restroom first,&quot; stated Maria. &quot;That's too bad, you'll just have to hold
    it. You too, girls!&quot; Ms. Fleicher motioned to the girls in line for the restroom to
    come with her. There were several groans from the girls, but they all followed her
    outside, since they knew arguing with Ms. Fleischer meant a detention. Maria grimaced, but
    she figured she could hold it until they got back to school, as the ride was only two
    hours.<br>
    Maria sat next to her friend Sara on the bus. On the other side of the aisle were Danielle
    and her friend Caitlyn. Caitlyn had been in the stall while Danielle was waiting to pee
    when Ms. Fleischer rounded everyone up. &quot;God, Ms. Fleischer is such a bitch, couldn't
    she have let us all pee, it would only have taken like five more minutes, tops.&quot;
    Danielle whispered to Caitlyn. &quot;Sucks for you, I got to piss just in time,&quot;
    Caitlyn replied. &quot;Screw you,&quot; Danielle replied back.<br>
    <br>
    Fifteen minutes into the bus ride home Maria was starting to feel the effects of all the
    water she drank. &quot;God, I must have drank like six bottles of water today&quot; she
    remarked to Sara. &quot;How are you holding up?&quot; Sara asked. &quot;I'm doing alright,
    I think I'll make it&quot;, replied Maria. &quot;Awww, does someone have to go
    peepee?&quot; someone said mockingly. It was Maria's friend Dave, who was sitting behind
    her. &quot;You're such a dick, Dave,&quot; Maria replied teasingly. Dave and Maria were
    very good friends, and constantly poked fun at one another.<br>
    <br>
    It was now one hour into the trip home. By now Maria was jiggling her legs quite a bit, as
    were Danielle and a few other people. &quot;Don't worry Maria, we're halfway there,&quot;
    said Sara, putting her arm on her friend's shoulder. &quot;Yeah, but there's still another
    hour. I'm starting to doubt if I can hold it that long.&quot; Maria replied. &quot;Yeah, I
    have to go pretty bad too,&quot; remarked Danielle. &quot;You guys will be fine, don't
    sweat it,&quot; Caitlyn said. &quot;I don't know Cait...&quot; Danielle said doubtfully.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly Evan, one of the boys in the class, shouted &quot;Hey! I need to pee! Can we pull
    over somewhere?&quot; This was met with several &quot;Yeah!&quot;s and &quot;Me
    too!&quot;s from the other students, including Maria, who was not shy about her bodily
    functions. &quot;Well, there aren't any rest stops or anything and it would take too long
    if you all waited to use the toilet at a gas station, so you'll just have to go on the
    side of the road,&quot; remarked the driver.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fine by me!&quot; Evan said enthusiastically.<br>
    The driver pulled over by a field, and several boys got out to pee. The girls were not too
    happy that there was no cover for them to pee behind, and most of them decided they would
    rather hold it. Maria, however, was no stranger to answering nature's call out in the
    open, as she would often go on hikes with her male friends, including Dave, and was not
    embarrassed in the least about exposing herself. <br>
    <br>
    Maria started to make her way down the aisle, but was stopped by Ms. Fleischer. &quot;Just
    where do you think you're going?&quot; she asked Maria. &quot;I need to pee,&quot; Maria
    replied. &quot;Well I'm not going to let you expose yourself to the whole class on a
    school trip,&quot; Ms. Fleischer told her. &quot;But I don't mind, and I really, really,
    need to go!&quot; pleaded Maria. &quot;One more word out of you and its detention for the
    rest of the week!&quot; Ms. Fleischer replied angrily. &quot; &quot;No one is going to
    flash their privates to the entire class on my watch,&quot; she added. &quot;Now go back
    to your seat and wait to use a real bathroom like the rest of the girls.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh my God, what a fucking bitch,&quot; Maria remarked to the other students upon
    returning to her seat. &quot;Yeah, seriously,&quot; Sara replied. &quot;Oh my God, were
    you really just going to go in front of everyone like that?&quot; Danielle asked her in
    amazement. &quot;Yeah, I don't care if people see my ass, I do it all the time around Dave
    and the other guys.&quot; Maria replied. &quot;Hell yeah she does,&quot; Dave remarked
    with a smirk. Maria rolled her eyes and focused on her ever increasingly full bladder.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aaaahhh, I have to pee sooo badddd!&quot; Maria whined, crossing her legs and
    fidgeting. &quot;You aren't the only one,&quot; added Danielle. &quot;Fuck, I hate Ms.
    Fleischer, I wish Mr. G. was chaperoning this trip, he would have let me go,&quot;
    remarked Maria. &quot;I still can't believe you wouldn't mind peeing in front of
    everyone.&quot; Caitlyn stated. &quot;Okay, can we all just STOP talking about pee for a
    while, I don't know if I'll make it unless I can get my mind off it.&quot; Maria pleaded. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hisssssss&quot; Dave was making peeing noises. &quot;Shut the hell up Dave,&quot;
    Sara scolded.<br>
    <br>
    Only a half hour left, girl,&quot; Sara said, trying to comfort her desperate friend.
    &quot;Can we please stop at a rest area or something? I don't think I can hold it for
    another half hour!&quot; Maria yelled to the driver. Several girls yelled in agreement.
    &quot;Out of the question! We are already ten minutes behind schedule, you all need to
    stop acting like children!&quot; Ms Fleischer angrily yelled back, before the driver could
    even respond. &quot;Are you sure, Ms.? There's a rest stop up ahead and it would only take
    a couple of minutes.&quot; The driver quietly asked Ms. Fleischer. &quot;Out of the
    question&quot; Ms. Fleischer replied back.<br>
    <br>
    Maria was frantic by now. She was alternating between openly holding herself and sitting
    on her heel. At this point everyone in the surrounding seats was watching her. &quot;Five
    bucks says she pisses herself,&quot; one male student said to his friend. Danielle wasn't
    in much better shape, but she was more modest in displaying her desperation, so nobody
    noticed how badly she had to go.<br>
    <br>
    Just ten minutes, Maria, you can do it!&quot; Sara said encouragingly. Maria was literally
    on the verge of tears, with both hands jammed into her crotch. &quot;I really don't think
    I can, Sara,&quot; Maria replied. &quot;Yes you can! Don't give up, girl!&quot; Sara said,
    trying to comfort her frantic friend. By now even Danielle was holding herself. &quot;Are
    you gonna make it?&quot; Caitlyn asked her. &quot;Yeah I think so, Danielle replied,
    biting her lip.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Five minutes, Maria! Just hold on for five more minutes!&quot; Sara cheered her
    friend on. Maria managed to choke out an &quot;Oh God...&quot; between fast, heavy
    breaths. Strands of Maria's dark, beautiful hair clung to her sweat-covered brow. &quot;I
    can't believe I'm asking this, Sara, but can you hold me down there for a second? I NEED
    to undo my pants and I can't do it with one hand.&quot; <br>
    &quot;Yeah, no problem, girl&quot; replied Sara. A series of &quot;ooohhh&quot;s arose
    from the male students watching the scene. &quot;Okay, on three, just jam your hand down
    there.&quot; Maria instructed. &quot;1...2...3!&quot; Sara quickly stuck her hand in
    Maria's crotch. &quot;You have to squeeze,&quot; Maria told her while panicking.
    &quot;A-alright...&quot; Sara said as she clamped down on Maria's privates. &quot;That's
    the ticket,&quot; Maria said, managing to force a small smile at her helpful friend. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Dykes!&quot; Dave shouted. &quot;Hey! There will be none of that kind of language on
    this bus!&quot; Ms. Fleischer shouted back. &quot;Sorry&quot; Dave replied sarcastically. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come on, come on...&quot; Maria said under her breath as she fiddled with the button
    on her pants. &quot;Got it!&quot; she exclaimed, unbuttoning and quickly unzipping her
    pants. &quot;Nice panties,&quot; teased Dave. &quot;Oh shut up, it's nothing you haven't
    seen before, Dave,&quot; Maria replied. &quot;Can I stop grabbing your vagina now?&quot;
    asked Sara. &quot;Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.&quot; Maria said sheepishly. Sara released her
    grip on Maria. &quot;Ooh!&quot; Maria blurted out before quickly jamming both her hands
    into her pubic area. &quot;I just leaked a little bit,&quot; she whispered to Sara, her
    face beet red. &quot;We're pulling into school now, can you make it to the restroom?&quot;
    Sara asked her. &quot;God, I hope so.&quot; Maria answered.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Alright, everyone off!&quot; shouted the bus driver as he pulled to a stop in front
    of the school. &quot;Shit, why did I have to sit so far in the back?&quot; Maria asked
    herself out loud. &quot;I get first crack at the toilet,&quot; Danielle said. &quot;Like
    hell you do, I'm on the verge of pissing myself right her!&quot; Maria replied
    frantically. &quot;We'll see who gets there first,&quot; Danielle quipped.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Finally I can get off the bus!&quot; Maria exclaimed. She quickly stood up, eager to
    get to the bathroom. &quot;Oof, bad idea,&quot; she remarked, bending her knees while
    still holding herself. &quot;Come on, get a move on! You aren't the only one who has to
    go!&quot; someone a couple rows back remarked loudly. Maria hobbled as quickly as she
    could off the bus, leaking a tiny bit every few steps. Finally off the bus, Maria voiced
    her doubts about making it to the door. &quot;I can barely walk it hurts so bad,&quot; she
    said to Sara, choking back tears of both pain and shame. &quot;I'll carry you,&quot; Sara
    told her. &quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Maria thanked her. &quot;What are friends
    for?&quot; Sara cheerfully replied. <br>
    <br>
    Danielle was making her way to the school's entrance much faster than Maria and Sara,
    determined not to embarrass herself. A couple other girls, Heather and Maureen, were the
    first to get there. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; Maureen said, doing a pee dance. &quot;What's
    the problem?&quot; asked Sara. &quot;The fucking door is locked!&quot; she exclaimed.
    Maria's heart sank. &quot;Is there another way in?&quot; she asked, barely able to
    concentrate on what was happening. &quot;Its ten past six, the school's closed,&quot; Ms.
    Fleischer told the girls. &quot;Don't you have a key?&quot; Maria pleaded, tears streaming
    down her face. &quot;Only the janitors have keys, and they've all gone home.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This can't be happening, oh god this can't be-&quot; Maria froze. &quot;I'm sorry
    Sara,&quot; she cried. &quot;Sorry for wha-&quot; Sara's question was answered when she
    felt the wetness on her arms. &quot;Oh no...&quot; she said, letting Maria down. Maria
    stood up and continued to empty her bladder into her pants, crying the whole time. She
    moved her hands out of her crotch to cover her face. Without her hands holding them up,
    her pants dropped to the ground. Maria didn't even pull them back up, she just sobbed
    harder, her pee stream now visible, going right through her blue cotton panties and
    splattering on the ground at Sara's feet.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Shit, shit, shit,&quot; Danielle said under her breath. Seeing and hearing Maria's
    stream was too much for her already overworked bladder to handle. Danielle started wetting
    herself too. &quot;I can't FUCKING believe this!&quot; she yelled angrily. Caitlyn started
    snickering at her friend, videotaping her accident with her cell phone.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No way am I pissing in these jeans,&quot; Maureen stated, pulling down her pants and
    panties and pissing on the ground in front of everyone. &quot;That's two weeks of
    detention, young lady!&quot; Ms. Fleischer screamed. &quot;This is well worth it,&quot;
    Maureen replied, smiling and tilting her head back in relief. Heather started sobbing as
    she joined her friend Maureen, covering her face in embarrassment. &quot;That goes for you
    too, Miss.&quot; Ms. Fleischer told her.<br>
    <br>
    Maria's stream finally trickled to a stop, her pants still around her ankles. &quot;This
    is the worst day of my fucking life,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't worry, girl, you're not
    alone,&quot; Sara told her. She reached out and hugged Maria tight, and Maria felt a warm
    wetness against her bare legs. &quot;Are you-&quot; she started to ask. &quot;What are
    friends for?&quot; Sara answered, smiling.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; a man's voice asked, interrupting the moment.
    &quot;D-dad?!&quot; Maria stammered. &quot;You guys got here too late for the buses home
    so the school called all the parents to pick you kids up.&quot; he stated. &quot;Now why
    are you girls all soaked, and why the hell are your pants down?&quot; he asked.
    &quot;We'll explain everything in the car, Mr. Zellar.&quot; Sara told him. &quot;It
    better be one hell of a good explanation,&quot; he told them. &quot;Now pull up your damn
    pants and get in the car,&quot; he told his daughter.<br>
