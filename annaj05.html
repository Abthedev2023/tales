    <br>
    It started off as just a regular Saturday: playful, passionate morning sex followed by a
    movie and an early lunch. My boyfriend and I have been dating for several months now but
    we still have that new relationship excitement.<br>
    <br>
    I've never told him about my desperation fetish but I think he'd find it gross. He's as
    macho as he's totally hot, and I don't want to take the risk. The closest I get to
    involving him is being slightly full during sex sometimes, simply to increase my own
    pleasure.<br>
    <br>
    Being into desperation gives me the advantage of not genuinely being caught short too
    often. But today I overlooked the effect of &quot;breaking the seal&quot;. I previously
    thought that this only happened with beer but learned the hard way that this is not the
    case. Basically if you drink large quantities of fluid over a few hours, you can put off
    peeing the first time for a while but After that you'll go from needing to pee to
    practically wetting yourself relatively quickly.<br>
    <br>
    The timeline:<br>
    <br>
    9am - 10oz water<br>
    10am - 16oz iced tea<br>
    <br>
    By the time 11:30am came around I figured I should use the bathroom before the movie. I
    wasn't at all desperate but I was feeling enough pressure that I knew it would become a
    real problem during the movie. So I went.<br>
    <br>
    Once the movie was over, we had lunch at a really nice Japanese place. I drank three or
    four 8oz glasses all together without having realized it at the time. The server kept
    refilling my glass. Just as we were leaving, I was getting some very early warning signs
    from my bladder but I ignored them because my boyfriend was running late. I would have
    gone if I had considered it a real problem. That was an underestimation on my part to say
    the least. <br>
    <br>
    I went from slightly uncomfortable to so full I wouldn't be able to walk straight very
    quickly. Thankfully we were in the car, which made it easy to clamp my legs together and
    press my pussy against the seat. On the other hand, we were on a busy highway with no
    place to pull over without hundreds of people watching. I was the one driving which made
    it slightly more difficult. I found it impossible to maintain a real conversation and
    control my bladder at the same time but I don't think I was fidgeting. I was good at
    maintaining the façade.<br>
    <br>
    At first it was kind of an exciting challenge. I was even getting horny at the thought of
    fighting this secret battle right in front of my boyfriend. But as time goes on, even more
    liquid was being forced into my already full bladder and I started wondering if I could
    physically hold it. I managed to hold it though with only one or two small spurts. I even
    kissed him as he left the car. I managed not to gasp as the seat belt pressed against my
    abdomen when I leaned over.<br>
    <br>
    I jammed one hand into my crotch as I sped away. I was wearing a mid-length skirt and
    panties, which were getting progressively damp. As I headed back towards the highway to
    get home, I started to get frantic. I knew how to drop my boyfriend off but I did not know
    the area. And I was getting very close to completely losing control. I turned onto the
    nearest side street, pulled over and found a large coffee cup from the day before. It was
    on the floor of the passenger side and I nearly peed myself trying to get at it.<br>
    <br>
    Frantically trying to hold my pee in just a bit longer, I pulled my panties down, put the
    cup between my legs and sat with my knees on the seat. It was in the middle of the day,
    and I was terrified of being seen. I was more terrified of making my car smell of pee and
    actually peeing myself like a little girl though.<br>
    <br>
    My pee poured out of me like a faucet into the cup. It splashed a little wetting my skirt
    a little but it was minor damage considering what would have happened if I had not enacted
    this desperate measure. It was the first time I had done anything like this, and I had the
    craziest sensation that I was peeing myself even though I knew that a container was
    catching it. I had to stop when I felt the cup getting full which was torture. I poured
    the contents of the cup onto the street and put the cup back under my skirt to continue. I
    did this a total of three times before I was totally empty.<br>
    <br>
    I drove home feeling physically relieved and bewildered at what I had just done. Then I
    realized it was totally hot in retrospect.<br>
