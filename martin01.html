    Store Assistant<br>
    </strong><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><br>
    <br>
    In my days as a student, I earned a little extra as an assistant in a shoe store. One
    evening my boss had left me to mind the store on my own, because he had to attend some
    social thing with his wife. I had lost track of time, trying to work out the numbers for
    the day. <o:p></o:p></span></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had been on my own in
    the store for some time when -just before closing time- a lady entered. She walked right
    up to the shoe racks and started looking at the shoes. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I took a minute or two to look at
    her. She was in her late twenties or early thirties, not very tall with dark blonde,
    shoulder long hair. She was wearing a red sweater, a tight red spandex miniskirt and black
    pumps. She didn't wear nylons. Her legs were quite tanned and muscular with hard, round
    thighs and calves. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In these two minutes she already
    appeared very restless, as she kept pacing up and down in front of the shoes. &quot;Can I
    help you?&quot; I asked, walking up to her. For a moment, she was forced to stand still
    and immediately crossed her legs. By Jove, if it only were so. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She told me that she was invited for
    a wedding the next day and had bought this gorgeous dress and needed a pair of equally
    gorgeous shoes to match it. In the meantime, she kept on crossing and uncrossing her legs.
    She pointed out four different shoes to me and asked me if she could fit them in her size.
    I took the shoes with me to the storage room to find the same ones in her size. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It only took me a couple of seconds,
    but I took some time to secretly look at her from around the corner. She was still pacing
    up and down and every now and then she stopped to cross her legs. She also kept pulling
    the hem of her skirt down as it kept riding up. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I decided to purposely
    &quot;forget&quot; one pair of shoes and re-entered. Again she was forced to stand still,
    but she hardly succeeded, continuously lifting each heel in turn, causing each of her
    thighs in turn to slightly pull up into her crotch. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For a moment she hesitated. Then she
    swiftly walked to a chair and sat down, immediately crossing her legs. I followed her and
    kneeled down in front of her. She had already removed her old shoes. I slipped the first
    shoe on the bare foot that hung loose while observing with a shock of excitement and
    satisfaction that even while she had her legs crossed, I could see a tiny triangle of
    white cloth shining in between the spandex of her skirt and her squeezing thighs. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then she uncrossed her legs and the
    full length of her thighs unfolded right in front of my eyes uncovering the bulging crotch
    of her white cotton panties with in the middle the contours of her pussy lips. Then she
    re-crossed her legs the other way around to allow me to put on the other shoe. I could
    just hear how she sucked in her breath through her teeth. I was now sure: this woman was
    desperate for a pee. She got up to walk around on the new shoes. I didn't dare to get up,
    because my hard-on would have shown through my pants. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She stopped in front of a mirror to
    look at her feet, but couldn't keep still for a moment, shifting her weight from one leg
    to another and back. God, she was almost pee-dancing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Suddenly she asked: &quot;Can I
    please use your bathroom?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The way she asked it made my hard-on
    even harder. The pressure in her abdomen was almost audible. Especially the way she said
    &quot;please&quot; told the whole story: the effort it took to make her voice sound calm
    and composed, as if some invisible force made her ask something that she had put off as
    long as she could, just as she was putting off burying her hands in her crotch. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My answer was a hard blow to her:
    &quot;Sorry, our toilet is out of order. We use the one next door, but they should be
    closed by now&quot;. She recovered from the shock, but I could see the worry in her eyes.
    She quickly returned to the chair to allow me to slip the second pair of shoes on her
    feet. Again, this was accompanied by one of the greatest spectacles of leg crossing and
    uncrossing that I was ever allowed to witness from so close by. She got up again and
    hobbled around. Even to the greatest idiot her desperation would have been obvious by now.
    She did a very sexy walking pee-dance. &quot;They are great for dancing as well&quot;, I
    said and she cast me a painfully smile. She danced back to the chair and crossed her legs
    while pressing her hand sideways between her thighs and under her skirt against her
    panty-crotch.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Ssssss... This is awful. I'm
    bursting. Please hurry!&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Dancing around on the third pair,
    she had to hold herself. Nevertheless, she remembered the pair of shoes I had
    &quot;forgotten&quot;. Again, I took my time to find them and when I got back, she was
    already seated with her crossed legs impatiently squirming about. It was hard to put the
    shoes on because she couldn't keep her legs still. All the time I kept an eye-and-a-half
    on her fingers that were pressing and squeezing in her panty-crotch, that seemed to become
    slightly transparent. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She wanted to get up to walk around,
    but she had to re-cross her legs as another wave hit her. Finally, she did manage to
    hobble around a bit. After a bit of thinking accompanied by lots of dancing, crotch
    grabbing and leg crossing, she decided on buying two pairs. Even at the till, I watched
    her dancing legs and her hand in her panty-crotch through the glass counter. With an
    impatient gesture, she swept her change into her shopping bag with the shoes. She no
    longer had the ability to stand still while counting change, let alone put it in her
    purse. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then she started hobbling toward the
    door with tiny steps, squeezing her thighs together. I wanted to open the door for her,
    but then she froze, crossing her thighs, bending her knees. For several seconds, she stood
    there, her eyes closed, her whole body shaking with the effort to keep her sphincters
    shut. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then it happened: she grabbed a
    little boot that was within reach, uncrossed her legs, pulled up her skirt, squatted down
    holding the boot under her. There she was: right in front of me, peeing through her
    panties and I could see everything. Even through her panties, her stream was hard and kept
    going for at least a minute. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then she stood up, handed the boot
    to me and dashed out of the store, while tears ran down her cheeks. I never saw her again,
    but I took the boot home with me. It is still a precious souvenir to me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
