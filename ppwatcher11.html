    </p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I mentioned in some of my other
    stories, I lived in the dorms in college. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was cheap and it was one of the
    best damn times I've ever had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is the
    only time I have ever witnessed mass desperation by an entire floor of women.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you have read my other stories, then you are
    aware that in my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had communal bathrooms and that the
    floors were segregated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the things we
    did on the 4th floor &quot;ZOO&quot; was to adopt the 2nd floor girls as our sister floor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through the course of the year we did service
    projects together, planned parties together and just socialized a great deal.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We also played practical jokes on each other, all
    the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One cold crisp January morning those
    of us on the 4th floor were greeted with a rather vicious practical joke from our sister
    floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As we early birds hit the shower, we
    found a not very welcome surprise waiting for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Seems
    that over night the girls had managed to sneak into our showers and filled all the
    showerheads with Kool-Aid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My, what a pretty
    sight it was- red, orange, and blue water coming down onto us from the showerheads.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say this little transgression could
    not go unpunished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We had a floor meeting and mulled
    over our options.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We thought of taking all
    their toilet seats, filling trashcans half full of water and leaning them into their doors
    and all kinds of other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Zach came
    up with the perfect plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would penny lock
    them in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For those of you that are
    un-educated in the fine art of penny locking let me take time to explain.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the room doors opened inward from the frames.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the most important criterion for penny
    locking.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an engineering fact that the
    force a human can exert on a doorknob to turn it is insufficient when the door has been
    penny locked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To penny lock a door you need
    two people and two pennies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the top of the
    door, one person forces the shut door to bow inward while the second person turns a penny
    sideways into the now created opening between the door and the frame.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Repeat the process at the bottom of the door.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the door bowed, a human being cannot turn the
    doorknob and open the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Thursday night was our planned
    revenge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We bought a roll of pennies and set
    our alarm clocks for 3:30 AM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
    appointed hour we all got up and ventured down to the 2nd floor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I won't tell you how we got past the locked hall
    door- all you need know is that we did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    broke off into pairs and set about our work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little
    did we realize, but we were about to commit the perfect crime.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You see we caught every girl in her room asleep.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not one person was AWOL that night.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would not learn this little fact till later. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The Navy Seals would have been proud
    of the stealth we used in locking these doors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
    a sound, not a word, and not one target alerted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
    in five minutes we were done and back on our floor, laughing and heading back to bed.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our sleep was to be short lived though.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know who got the first call, but I got my
    first call around 5:12 AM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Linda was on the
    phone cussing at me and telling me we better get down there right now, because she and
    Cindy were about to piss on the carpet and this was just not funny.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone else got similar calls from the girls on
    the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is when we realized that we
    had got them all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No one on the floor could
    get out to go to the bathroom, or let the other girls out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was no way that we were going
    to miss this show.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of us headed down to
    the 2nd floor and some of us went outside to rub it in a little bit.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am sure glad I chose to go outside first.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I said before, we did not have air conditioning
    in our building so all their windows were steel double hung with screens that came off
    easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We never did know exactly whom the 5
    butts we saw dangling out of windows belonged to, but the streams were strong and
    continuous from the 2nd floor to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
    these girls could not wait and choose to pee out the windows. Other girls were not that
    brave and many a trashcan got carried to the bathroom upon their release to be emptied.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rumor had it that a couple of girls just could not
    bring themselves to use the window, the trashcan or any other container and ended up
    wetting themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About this time the R.A. from the
    first floor showed up on second floor and began to let the girls out of their rooms.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well we were not stupid and we all took off for
    breakfast at the dining hall because we did not want to be around to face the music.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Within 15 minutes, our little sisters surrounded
    us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were cussing us, screaming at us,
    and threatening us, and eventually laughing with us too.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>They got their food and came over to sit down and eat with us.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The stories we heard were varied and
    all hilarious.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>From the shock and desperate
    horror of being locked away from the bathrooms with an early morning full bladder to the
    use of trashcans, drinking glasses, a gold fish bowl, (lucky fish) to windows.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Several of them commented that the waited as long
    as they could dancing around their rooms trying to wait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Some of them admitted that they lost the battle when a roommate would pee in
    the trashcan or some other container and the sound was too much for them.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of them reluctantly agreed that we had done a
    really good job by catching them all in their rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was at this point that I learned
    something about women that I did not realize before this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I knew that they as a whole seemed to pee more often then men and could not
    wait as long between trips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But they also as
    a whole have a general, urgent urge to pee after getting up first thing in the morning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While I too need a morning pee, I can usually wait
    to get the coffee on, grab the paper from the front yard or do some other simple thing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently this is not so with most women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A few of the girls boasted that they
    were able to wait until they were released from their rooms until rushing to the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A couple of the girls even embarrassedly admitted
    that upon reaching the bathrooms and finding all the stalls occupied, they could no longer
    wait, peeing on the shower floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And of
    course they all threatened revenge upon us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    had our laughs and our breakfast and off to classes we ventured.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The dorms as I have stated before
    were a good time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And they were the source
    of many more desperation and peeing observations during my four years.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But those are for another story...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
