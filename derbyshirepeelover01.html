    <br>
    <br>
    This is my first attempt at posting here - hope you like it. This is also a fantasy -
    there is no Sarah and the events portrayed are completely fictitious.<br>
    <br>
    I'd been going out with Sarah for quite some time, and we had a fairy normal
    boyfriend/girlfriend relationship in all respects. I had never mentioned my interest in
    watersports and I'd never had the slightest indication that she was interested either.
    Then one day we decided to go to the seaside. We wanted somewhere fairly secluded, so the
    trip turned into a long weekend in Cornwall. I don't remember exactly where we ended up -
    we stayed at a B&amp;B in Truro, but we drove for quite a while before we found what we
    were looking for. The beach was perfect - a wide bay with a fabulous sandy beach and the
    sea wasn't too rough either. We aren't surfers and I think we ended up on the Cornish
    south coast, rather than the Atlantic coast. Anyway, the day was perfect - the sun beat
    down and because we were so far from anywhere there weren't that many people around
    either. The only down side was that there were no shops or cafes and therefore - to my
    delight - no toilets either.<br>
    <br>
    That wasn't a problem to me, as I would just go into the sea and pee there, and I suspect
    Sarah was doing the same.<br>
    <br>
    In the afternoon we settled on our towels to soak up some rays and that was when it
    happened. I mentioned that it was a shame that there wasn't a shop, as I could just murder
    an ice cream and Sarah said &quot;never mind ice cream, I'm absolutely dying for a
    pee.&quot; I tried to stay cool, but my mouth was dry as I said that maybe she should just
    wade into the water and go there, but she said she didn't want to do that as she was nice
    and dry and she'd only just put more sun-cream on. This was starting to look very good,
    but ever the gentleman I suggested looking for somewhere where she could relieve herself
    in private, but looking up and down the beach it was obvious that wasn't possible - there
    wasn't a rock or a tree in sight. In fact, just about the only shelter was from the cars
    in the car park, but there were lots of people milling around there. I tried to suggest
    that she waited until there were fewer people around, but it was becoming obvious that she
    couldn't hold on much longer - her hand was straying between her thighs to press her
    pee-hole.<br>
    <br>
    The only thing I could think of was to dig a hole, pee in it, and then cover it up so we
    quickly pretended to build a sandcastle. We knelt at opposite sides of the hole, sitting
    on our ankles, and Sarah quickly dug out the sand between her legs so her bottom was
    effectively over a small trench. &quot;Keep a look out&quot; she said, &quot;I just can't
    hold it any longer&quot;. I looked around and told her that the coast was clear then
    diplomatically turned away - &quot;don't worry about that,&quot; she said, &quot;I need
    you to watch in case someone is coming.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Well, the only person in any danger of that was me- I could have entered a pole- vaulting
    competition at that point in time. Then it happened - with a very slight sigh Sarah
    shifted position and I could see a darker patch forming at the front of her bikini. In a
    few seconds a healthy jet of pee was hissing out of her into the sand. I was in heaven
    watching her pee, but I was also in severe danger of having an accident myself. I tried to
    think of something else, but it was impossible and with a groan I knew I was close to
    losing the struggle. &quot;Take it out - quick,&quot; said Sarah, so I pulled down the
    waistband of my shorts just enough to free the very tip of my penis. I didn't even need to
    touch it - the movement of the fabric was enough and I pumped jet after jet of semen into
    the air, which landed in the hole in the sand, splashing into Sarah's rapidly expanding
    puddle. &quot;Wow&quot; she gasped, &quot;I thought you had to pee too, I didn't realize
    that was going to happen. I guess you like to see me pee then?&quot; Silly question. What
    she asked next was a massive surprise though - &quot;have you ever had a holding on
    contest with someone?&quot; I said that I hadn't, and with a wicked little smile she said
    that maybe that was something I would like to try. I replied that I certainly would, and
    that will be the subject of another posting - soon.<br>
