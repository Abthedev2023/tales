    <br>
    Helen sat on her rucksack, looking at her watch and tapping her feet. She was irritated.
    No, worse, she was angry. It was quarter to eleven. Their coach left at five to.
    &quot;Meet at Drummer Street at half ten.&quot; That was what Andy had said. But where the
    hell was he? Helen had passed on a second cup of tea at breakfast in order to be here on
    time. If only she'd known Andy was going to be late, she needn't have done that. And it
    wasn't as if she needed to exercise restraint for the sake of her bladder, either. They'd
    been assured that the Norwich service always ran the most modern coaches with toilets and
    everything.<br>
    <br>
    A red Ford Escort clattered to a halt by the kerb in front of her. Its engine didn't sound
    at all happy. It had a dented left wing and a buckled bonnet, and its headlight was
    dangling free, held in place by nothing but its wire. Andy jumped out of the passenger
    seat.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry I'm late,&quot; he said. &quot;Mum had a bit of an accident on the way
    here.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh!&quot; gasped Helen. &quot;You're not hurt or anything?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We're fine,&quot; said Andy. &quot;But dad isn't half going to make some comments
    about women drivers when he sees it. You look stunning, by the way.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen was pleased he'd noticed. She'd taken some trouble this morning to make herself look
    as desirable as possible, whilst nevertheless choosing something that made sense to wear
    for a long coach journey. In the end she'd settled for some old faded cut off jeans,
    sandals, and a dark blue cotton T-shirt. The cut offs had been an experiment last summer.
    She'd had difficulty getting them even, trimming them shorter and shorter until eventually
    they were practically hot pants. They accentuated the curves of her bum, and showed off
    the whole of her legs, and she'd never dared wear them until now. But now, the first day
    of her first holiday together with Andy, with the August sun beating down and a heat haze
    already rising from the pavement, they seemed the perfect thing to be wearing.<br>
    <br>
    Andy kissed her, and then went round to the boot of the car. He unloaded his own rucksack,
    which he dropped onto the pavement with a thud, followed by the big canvas bag containing
    the tent, which would be their home for the next week.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks mum,&quot; he called as he closed the boot. &quot;You can go and face the
    music now, if you like.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What happened?&quot; asked Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, you know,&quot; shrugged Andy. &quot;The usual sort of thing: incorrect ratio of
    stopping space to stopping ability. Shall we go and find our coach?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They found the Norwich coach and loaded their luggage, then climbed aboard and made their
    way to a seat somewhere near the back of the coach.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is comfy,&quot; said Helen as she snuggled into the seat by the window.
    &quot;But I bet it's going to get hot.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've brought a couple of bottles of coke,&quot; said Andy. &quot;They should
    help.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The coach left soon after, and made its ponderous way out of Cambridge. Traffic was heavy,
    and they crawled slowly out along the Newmarket Road towards the A14. Andy checked his
    watch incessantly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Relax,&quot; said Helen. &quot;We're going on holiday. No pressure. No schedules.
    Just laze on the beach all day. So we're not going very fast. Okay. So what?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So this,&quot; said Andy. &quot;The buses from Norwich to Wells only run every two
    hours, and the connection is fairly tight. If we don't make the connection, we're going to
    have a long wait at Norwich bus station.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can think of worse places to have to wait,&quot; replied Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Have you ever been to Norwich bus station?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That figures,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Have some coke.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen took the bottle, unscrewed the cap, and took a cooling swig.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ugh!&quot; she grimaced. &quot;It's warm already.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry,&quot; shrugged Andy. &quot;I guess it's the weather. But at least it's
    wet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Indeed,&quot; agreed Helen. She wished he hadn't mentioned the word &quot;wet&quot;.
    It reminded her of the times he'd taken her punting. Both times she'd managed to end up
    wetting her knickers. Both times she'd managed to hide the fact from Andy. She'd been
    embarrassed and humiliated, but the second time she'd also felt strangely excited by the
    whole experience. It had left her confused and bewildered, and she'd tried her best not to
    think about it again. But now it all came flooding back into her consciousness. She
    crossed her legs and turned to look out of the window, while she fought to control her
    racing mind. One part of her mind said &quot;I hope I never wet my knickers again&quot;
    while the other part said &quot;But it was enjoyable- so enjoyable. I want to do it again
    some time.&quot; Eventually she reached a compromise. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said to
    herself. &quot;Maybe I'll do it again some time- in private. When I'm alone and in control
    of the situation. But not today; not unless I have an accident. And I'd better NOT have an
    accident. Not in the knickers I'm wearing today.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen had chosen her knickers carefully this morning. The tent they would be sharing was a
    big frame tent with two separate sleeping areas and a communal living area. They'd
    solemnly told their parents that she'd sleep in one sleeping area and Andy would sleep in
    the other, but she had this sneaking suspicion that they might just end up sharing the
    same sleeping area tonight. She also thought that Andy might end up undressing her at some
    stage in the proceedings. So she had decided to wear the special pair of knickers, which
    she had bought last week, just for him. They were white with little red love hearts all
    over them; and she hoped he'd get the message. So the last thing she wanted was to have
    any sort of accident during the course of the day and have to change into something else.
    But then, why should she have an accident? On the punt she had been stranded, miles from
    anywhere, unable to get to a toilet when she needed- this coach had a toilet on board, and
    relief was only a matter of seconds away any time she needed a wee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Helen,&quot; said Andy. &quot;You alright there?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;I'm fine. Just thinking, that's all.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;A penny for them?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you know, I've not been camping since I was in the guides,&quot; she improvised.
    &quot;Miss Rowland took us to the Isle of Wight one year, and it rained all week.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I bet you looked stunning in your guide uniform,&quot; Andy grinned.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Really? I hated it. That awful, frumpy, functional skirt.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Maybe I'd like you in a frumpy, functional skirt. You never know.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I thought you liked me in these cut-offs.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That too. More coke?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The heat was making Helen feel thirsty, so she took another long swig of warm cola, and
    then fished around in her handbag for her MP3 player.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What you got there?&quot; Andy asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Rocky Horror soundtrack.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I love Rocky Horror,&quot; said Andy, somewhat to Helen's surprise. She really
    hadn't thought it would be his sort of thing. &quot;T-t-t-t-t-t-touch me, I want to get
    dirty, thrill me chill me fulfil me, creature of the night,&quot; he sort of sang.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You know the all words? I'm impressed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We did it as the school show one year. I was in it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But not as Janet, surely?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, no. But I was going out at the time with the girl who played Janet, so we sort
    of learned our lines together.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen turned to look at Andy and sat, cross-legged, with her back to the window. She
    briefly wondered whether she was giving him a premature flash of her loveheart knickers up
    the legs of the cut off hot pants. Oh well, if she was she was. It was a bit late to worry
    about that now.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So who were you, then? Were you Frank N Furter?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; said Andy, blushing slightly. &quot;I was Eddie.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Eddie? The Hells Angel?&quot; giggled Helen. &quot;You hardly seem the type.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But you think I am the type for Frank N Furter, do you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, no, actually, now you come to mention it. But why Eddie?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It was sort of default casting,&quot; shrugged Andy. &quot;I was the only one who
    could ride a motorcycle round the stage without falling into the orchestra pit. And
    besides, you don't actually have to be able to sing to belt out Eddy's one and only
    number, do you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    For the rest of the journey they shared the headphones, and sang along to the soundtrack,
    much to the irritation of the other travellers who glared at them from time to time. But
    Helen and Andy were in a little world of their own, oblivious to everything that was going
    on around them, and equally oblivious (in Helen's case, at any rate) to the fact that they
    were now crawling through the outskirts of Norwich, and that if she wanted to use the
    toilet on the coach she would have to do so soon. She was beginning to feel the first
    faint urges of a need to pee, and began to wonder whether she should just ask Andy to let
    her out so she could go to the loo. But she was still a little shy of mentioning such
    things to Andy, and by the time she had plucked up the courage to say something the coach
    was already pulling in to Norwich bus station. Ah well, never mind, she thought. She
    wasn't particularly desperate yet. She could still hold on for quite a while if she had
    to, and there was bound to be a toilet she could use at the bus station.<br>
    <br>
    Andy looked at his watch.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Three minutes,&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We've got three minutes to get off, get our luggage, find the Wells bus and get
    aboard. It's going to be tight.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Helen, wondering whether there would be a toilet on the Wells bus.<br>
    <br>
    There wasn't. It was just a standard, elderly, Leyland single-decker. Red. Eastern
    Counties. They heaved their luggage aboard, put it in the luggage rack by the doors, and
    Andy paid the fare to Wells-next-the-sea.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How long is the journey?&quot; asked Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;About an hour and a half,&quot; replied the driver.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Helen. This, she realised with a start, was going to be difficult.<br>
    <br>
    As she settled into her seat, Andy fetched something from the pocket of his rucksack.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Here,&quot; he said, thrusting a little polythene bag at her. &quot;Lunch. Sorry
    it's a bit late, but I couldn't get to it on the coach.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sandwiches.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can see that, silly. What's in them?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cheese and cucumber,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Lots of cucumber. Cool and refreshing
    was my thought.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Great, thought Helen. Lots of cucumber: lots more fluid. But she ate them anyway, and just
    hoped she'd be able to hold on. She didn't think she could afford even the slightest
    little leak in her knickers today, since any wet spot on these faded denim cut offs would
    show up a mile off. So she sat tight and crossed her legs, and hoped she'd be able to last
    the whole journey.<br>
    <br>
    They hadn't been going for long when Andy put his arm around her shoulders and began
    gently stroking her upper arm.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mmmm,&quot; she sighed, turning slightly and leaning back into his shoulder.<br>
    <br>
    The combination of Helen's full bladder and Andy's caresses had a peculiarly arousing
    effect on Helen, and she began to start thinking sexy thoughts, which made her squirm
    excitedly in her seat. Andy, feeling this, brought his free hand up to hug Helen and
    gently teased one of her nipples through her T-shirt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Helen,&quot; he murmured in her ear. &quot;You wearing a bra?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; she whispered back, and immediately felt his penis harden against her
    lower back. She also felt his hand drop from her breast and start to fumble with the hem
    of her T-shirt, trying to pull it out of the waistband of her shorts. As he did so, he
    pressed inadvertently against her swollen bladder.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Don't,&quot; she yelped. &quot;You'll make me wet myself doing that, if you're not
    careful.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oh good grief. She'd actually said it. Actually admitted to him that she was struggling
    with a full bladder. She blushed furiously, and crossed her legs tightly together.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I do believe you mean it,&quot; said Andy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I wouldn't make something like that up.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You are going to be alright though, aren't you?&quot; Andy sounded concerned.
    &quot;I mean; nineteen year olds never really wet their knickers do they? When they say
    things like I pissed myself laughing, that's just a figure of speech, isn't it? It doesn't
    really happen.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It does sometimes,&quot; replied Helen. &quot;And if this particular nineteen year
    old isn't careful, there's a very real danger it might happen to her today. But I really
    hope it won't.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So do I,&quot; said Andy. &quot;You're wearing such cute knickers today, it would be
    such a shame if they got wet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You've seen them?&quot; gasped Helen, nearly losing it there and then out of sheer
    surprise.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Anybody who's followed you today has seen them.
    There's about half an inch of white knickers with little red hearts on them peeping out
    below your shorts on your left bum.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why didn't you say anything?&quot; protested Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I just did.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I mean, why didn't you say anything sooner?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What, and encourage you to sort it out so your knickers weren't on display? I was
    enjoying the view.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Humph!&quot; said Helen, turning her back on him and concentrating all her attention
    and energy on saving herself from having an embarrassing accident before they got to
    Wells. Andy showed concern, asking from time to time if there was anything he could do to
    help, but really there wasn't. She crossed her legs one way, then the other. Leaned
    forwards and pressed her hands into her crotch; scissored her legs, jiggled her legs, sat
    on her heel, did anything and everything that might help. Once she had a sudden urge so
    strong that she thought she was about to lose control and wet herself helplessly, but then
    the urge subsided just when she was resigning herself to the thought that Andy was finally
    going to see her wet knickers. Another time she could have sworn she felt a little jet of
    pee spurting uncontrollably into her knickers before she could clamp it off, but when she
    looked down at her crotch there was no visible wet spot, and when she discretely slipped a
    finger up the leg of her shorts and felt between her legs, her knickers still felt dry to
    the touch. They were still dry when the bus stopped and the driver called out &quot;Wells
    next the sea! All change,&quot; but only just, and Helen was concerned that she might have
    to change in more ways than one.<br>
    <br>
    She stood up hesitantly, and hobbled uncertainly along the bus. Boy did her bladder ache,
    and how she longed just to relax and let it all flood out. But no! She must hold on until,
    until...<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You jump off, Helen. There are some public toilets on the left in a couple of
    hundred yards. I'll follow with the bags.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But you can't carry three bags all by yourself!&quot; protested Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And look as though you can't lift a single bag without making a puddle on the
    floor,&quot; replied Andy. &quot;So run along. I'll manage.&quot; He patted her on the
    bum, and she felt a tiny spurt of warm pee leak into her knickers as he did so. More
    wanted to follow, but she managed to hold it back. Oh goodness, she thought, that was
    close. And my knickers are definitely wet now, no doubt about that. I just hope it doesn't
    show on my shorts, and that I can make it to the toilets without wetting any more.<br>
    <br>
    So she didn't argue with Andy, but climbed gingerly off the bus and hobbled awkwardly
    along the street, cheeks burning red, hand pressed hard into her crotch, not caring who
    saw. It was agony, but she reached the toilets without any more leaks in her knickers. To
    her dismay, however, there was a queue of three people waiting. One of the toilets
    flushed, and the tinkling sound of water tumbling from the cistern into the toilet bowl
    was almost more than she could bear.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh no,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;I don't think I can wait any
    longer.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She obviously spoke louder than she had intended, because the lady at the front of the
    queue turned and looked at her. Seeing her standing there, legs knitted together, bobbing
    up and down and hopping from foot to foot, she took pity on Helen. &quot;You take the next
    one, love,&quot; she said, &quot;before you have an accident.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks,&quot; gasped Helen, and hobbled into the cubicle the moment the door opened
    and its previous occupant was out of the way. She pushed the door closed with her elbow as
    she passed, without pausing to lock it, and fumbled quickly with the button and zip of her
    cut offs. They dropped to the floor, leaving just her knickers to take down. Her cute
    white loveheart knickers. She didn't want to wet them. Really she didn't. Well, they were
    a little damp already, of course, but she didn't want to wet them any more. She certainly
    didn't want to give them a thorough soaking that Andy would have to find out about. If she
    did wet them, she couldn't just leave them behind and change into another pair. She didn't
    have another pair like them, and Andy had already seen them today. If he was going to
    undress her later this evening, she was going to have to be wearing them, and they were
    going to have to be dry. Otherwise he'd know she had wet herself. And she didn't want
    that. Yet, even as she hooked her thumbs into the waistband of her knickers and them
    pulled down, she could feel herself losing control. She couldn't hold on any longer. An
    uncontrollable, unstoppable stream of pee was leaving her bladder. Shooting along her
    short urethra. She could feel it. And she managed to sit just as it came hissing out. She
    heard it splashing into the toilet bowl. But had all of it gone into the toilet, or had
    she been just that fraction too slow? She looked down, dreading what she might see. Would
    there be little puddle at her feet? Would her knickers be wet or dry? She couldn't see
    over her knees so, still pissing forcefully, she leaned forward and felt gingerly down her
    legs to her knickers. Ran her fingers carefully around the waistband, down inside the
    front to the crotch, then up the back to the waistband again.<br>
    <br>
    There was absolutely no mistaking that sensation.<br>
    <br>
    There was nothing in the world that felt quite like it.<br>
    <br>
    What her fingers encountered was crisp, dry cotton. Just the one tiny damp spot caused by
    the one little leak she'd had when Andy patted her bum; and that would soon dry out.<br>
    <br>
    She breathed a sigh of relief, just as a matronly voice outside said, &quot;Look, this
    one's not locked,&quot; and the door burst open. A large, matronly woman was pushing a
    little girl of about six with tears in her eyes through the door. The woman looked up and
    saw Helen sitting on the toilet. She turned beetroot red. &quot;Oh, I'm terribly
    sorry,&quot; she gasped, grabbing the little girl's shoulders and trying to pull her back
    out again.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No, no, it's my fault,&quot; said Helen. She had finished weeing now, and she
    hurriedly stood and pulled her knickers and shorts back up. &quot;I didn't lock the door
    and I should have done. But I was about to wet myself.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm about to wet myself too,&quot; sniffed the little girl, looking as if she
    certainly meant it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, you've made it to the toilet now,&quot; said Helen, scooting quickly through
    the door. &quot;Just got to hold on a moment longer and you'll be fine.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen had just finished washing her hands when mother and daughter emerged from the
    cubicle. The little girl was no longer crying, and the mother had a relieved look on her
    face. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said to Helen. &quot;That was close, but she made it.
    Good job you hadn't locked the door, though. Two seconds more and I think we'd have had a
    puddle on the floor.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I know how that feels,&quot; said Helen. And she really meant it.<br>
    <br>
    When she emerged into the daylight, Helen was amazed to see that Andy had somehow carried
    both rucksacks and the tent bag all the way from the bus stop, and was no waiting on the
    corner just across the road.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come on,&quot; he grinned, &quot;we've a train to catch.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She crossed the road, and together they carried the luggage down to a little miniature
    gauge railway where a steam train waited, its engine hissing gently in the sun.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm glad I didn't hear that before I reached the toilet,&quot; said Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why?&quot; asked Andy, playfully. &quot;Would it have made you lose control?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It might,&quot; Helen giggled. &quot;Hissing sounds and desperation don't mix, you
    know.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Andy raised his eyebrows knowingly, and Helen punched him playfully on the arm. She was
    happy and relaxed now. Her bladder was empty, and but for the one little damp spot her
    knickers were still dry. The only thing she'd forgotten to do was check whether they were
    still on display behind or not. But oh well. You couldn't have everything.<br>
    <br>
    The steam train puffed along at a sedate pace - about a brisk walking speed, or a little
    faster. The tracks ran for about a mile along a causeway, beside a narrow road. Off to
    their left was some low-lying marshland. Beyond the road was a tall dyke, where people
    strolled with children and dogs, the dogs generally behaving themselves, the children
    generally not. At the end of the line the train came hissing to a standstill, and Helen
    saw a huge campsite, crammed with caravans.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is it,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Pinewoods campsite.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They paid for their pitch for the week, and pitched their tent. Or rather, Helen pitched
    the tent. Andy was singularly useless when it came to practical skills, and pitching tents
    was a practical skill par excellence. Eventually, Helen told him to leave it to her, so he
    sat cross-legged on the grass and tried to look up her shorts every time she passed. When
    the tent was up, Helen came out and stood with her hands on her hips: &quot;Right,&quot;
    she said. &quot;That's my job done for the evening. Your job is supper, okay?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fine,&quot; said Andy. He got out the little primus stove, and started straight away
    on what turned out to be an absolutely mouth-watering mushroom risotto. He also produced a
    six-pack of lager from somewhere, and they drank three cans apiece. When they were
    finished, he looked at his watch.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Seven thirty,&quot; he said. &quot;We've still got plenty of light. How about an
    evening walk along the beach?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sounds fun,&quot; said Helen. &quot;Does it have some nice dunes?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Lovely big dunes here. I'll just go and wash up. Why
    don't you change into your swimming things?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    So Helen went into the tent while Andy headed off to the washing up point. She'd brought a
    swimming costume with her - an emerald green one piece - but she had a suspicion that Andy
    might want to head off into the dunes for a kiss and a cuddle and ... well, if she wore
    the one piece swimsuit, that'd be all they did get. Because he couldn't exactly slip a
    hand down inside the waist band of a one-piece swimsuit, could he? And she certainly
    wouldn't take it off for him, because it would be far too fiddly to put back on if they
    heard anybody approaching. So she emptied out her rucksack and considered her options.
    Fortunately she had packed some matching purple knickers and bra which could pass muster
    as a bikini if she wore them with sufficient confidence, as she had with the matching
    coral pink knickers and bra the first time they'd gone punting. So she changed into these
    and waited for Andy's return.<br>
    <br>
    Andy ducked into the tent, blinked, and said, &quot;I thought your bikini was pink.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've got two bikinis,&quot; Helen lied, blushing slightly as she did so. &quot;I
    left the pink one at home.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Blimey,&quot; said Andy. &quot;How many bikinis does a girl need?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've got a one-piece as well,&quot; said Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I prefer you in a bikini.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I thought you might.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Andy took off his shirt and jeans, and Helen saw he was wearing black swimming trunks
    underneath. Saw also a pleasing bulge in the front.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Right,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    From the campsite it is a very short distance to the beach at Wells-next-the-sea. There is
    a public car park with a toilet block and gift shop, then a little concrete ramp up to the
    top of the dunes, and down the other side. A short wooden footbridge then takes you onto
    the beach itself, which curves away to the right in a long sandy arc. There's a row of
    brightly painted beach huts on your left. Behind and beyond them are the dunes, planted in
    the nineteenth century with the tall conifers that give the campsite its name. Andy and
    Helen walked hand in hand, and Helen quickly began to feel uncomfortable. Her bladder had
    been overworked, holding on in the afternoon; it had little appetite for another hold-it
    session this evening. But Helen had poured three cans of lager down her throat with her
    meal, and suddenly her bladder began to send her warning signals that it was getting
    pretty full. Helen ignored them to begin with. She knew that when it felt like this, she
    had plenty of time yet before she had to worry about finding a toilet. But as the signals
    became more and more urgent, she began to feel a little uneasy about it. Then she felt
    decidedly uneasy about it. She was getting very desperate indeed, very quickly indeed. She
    had never known anything quite like it.<br>
    <br>
    Then, to her horror, a little spasm sent shock waves through her bladder and she felt a
    little spurt of pee escape into her knickers. Oops! She blushed furiously. That wasn't
    meant to happen. Still, she had finally managed to speak to Andy about her need for the
    toilet this afternoon, and somehow it was easier second time round.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Andy?&quot; she said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That's me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are there any toilets on this beach?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Not on the beach, no,&quot; he replied. &quot;But there are some back in the car
    park, and there are some behind the dunes up those steps there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Andy pointed to some steps up to the top of the dunes. They were much closer than the car
    park; and Helen realised with something akin to panic that her bladder was filling so
    quickly and her tired abdominal muscles were so unwilling to assist her in holding on that
    it was touch and go whether she could make it back to the car park dry in any event. Oh
    God, this was not meant to happen! She was not meant to wet her knickers on their first
    evening together on the beach. Thank goodness for the toilets in the dunes.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Okay then,&quot; she said, turning and heading for the steps up the dunes.
    &quot;Back in a mo.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As she hurried up the steps, she realised with alarm that she was actually in a worse
    state than she'd thought- or even thought possible. Each time she stepped up it was a
    struggle not to start peeing in her knickers. How embarrassing would that be if she
    actually did? But now she was at the top of the dunes, and there at the bottom on the
    other side was a little brick building that could only be the toilets. Oh joy! She was
    going to be all right. She wasn't going to have an accident and wet her knickers after
    all. She was at the bottom of the steps in no time and, mincing slightly so as to keep her
    thighs pressed firmly together, she made her way across to the door marked
    &quot;Ladies&quot;. Turned the handle and pushed. The door didn't budge. Pulled instead-
    still no joy. Turned the handle the other way. Rattled the door. Tried the other door,
    marked &quot;Gentlemen&quot;. It was all locked! Then she saw the sign, which read
    &quot;Open 8 am - 8 pm&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed in frustration.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There's another block in the car park, half a mile that way,&quot; said a passing
    dog walker, pointing up the dunes back the way Helen and Andy had come. &quot;They're
    unlocked twenty four hours.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen thought about it. Could she make it back to the car park? Maybe- if she was very
    lucky. But what if she couldn't? There were lots of people back there, some of them
    staying on the campsite, no doubt. Knowing her luck she'd hold on until she was half way
    across the car park, and then wet her knickers in front of the family from the tent next
    to theirs. Which would include the mother and little girl from the toilets this afternoon.
    And the little girl would shout &quot;Look mummy, it's the woman who wets her knickers.
    This time she's wetting her knickers in the car park.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen closed her eyes and shuddered, mortified at the mere thought of it. Maybe it
    wouldn't come to that, though. Maybe she could make it back to the car park. But it would
    take time. She'd told Andy she'd be right back. If she went all the way back to the car
    park it would take ages. Absolutely ages. And Andy would wonder where she had gone. He
    might come looking for her. Get confused when he couldn't find her and the toilets were
    all locked up. Even if she came back dry, it would be awkward to explain. But worse still,
    supposing she came back wet? And supposing he'd raised the alarm and people were searching
    for her? And when they found her she was in wet knickers, and couldn't just slip quietly
    back to the tent to get changed but had to make a statement to the police to say that no,
    she hadn't been kidnapped or anything?<br>
    <br>
    It was all just too horrible to contemplate. No, she had told Andy she was coming to these
    toilets. She couldn't just run off to the car park toilets without going to tell Andy that
    was what she was doing first. But if she went back over to the dunes to Andy, and then all
    the way back to the car park, she almost certainly wouldn't make it. In fact, she realised
    as another spurt shot into her knickers, she probably wouldn't even be able to make it
    back over the dunes to Andy without wetting herself. She needed to pee and she needed to
    pee NOW!<br>
    <br>
    At least she was in the woods. There were lots of trees. She could just find somewhere
    nice and discreet, drop her knickers and squat down for a pee. Hardly elegant, but it
    would do. Except the woods were full of dog walkers, and families with children walking in
    the warm evening twilight, and no matter where she looked, there always seemed to be
    somebody there. Somebody who would surely see her if she dropped her knickers for a pee.
    But also somebody who would certainly see her humiliation if she didn't find somewhere to
    pee really soon and wet her knickers instead.<br>
    <br>
    Aargh! This wasn't meant to be happening. She shuddered and squirmed, and felt another
    spurt of pee escape into her knickers and run gently down her thigh. Oh good grief!
    Anybody who looked closely at her crotch would probably see the evidence that she was
    starting to wet herself, if the fabric was already that wet. What to do?<br>
    <br>
    And then it came to her: the sea! If only she could get to the sea before losing control,
    she could run in up to her waist and Andy needn't know about her predicament. She could
    wet herself in the sea, and he'd be none the wiser. After all, he knew she needed to go to
    the toilet, but equally he'd seen her go off in the direction of a toilet block. So he'd
    think she'd managed to have a pee. All she needed to do was to get to the sea before her
    knickers got any wetter. Before her accident became obvious. Assuming it wasn't obvious
    already. At least her knickers were a dark colour. That would help. But it wasn't a
    foolproof guarantee. She looked down. Couldn't see any obvious signs of wetness. Hoped
    Andy wouldn't, either.<br>
    <br>
    Desperately holding onto her crotch to try to keep her bladder under control, and
    squeezing her thighs together as she went, Helen climbed back up the dune. She managed to
    make it to the top without any more leaks or spurts, but her bladder was really straining
    now, and she realised with something between alarm and panic that now, despite the fact
    that she was on the brink of wetting herself, she was going to have to act normal. Look as
    though she hadn't a care in the world. As far as Andy was concerned, she had been to the
    toilet. She couldn't afford to give the game away and let him know that she hadn't.<br>
    <br>
    She took a deep breath, squirmed one more time for luck, and let go of her crotch. Eek!
    She nearly wet her knickers there and then. She squeezed her thighs together, leaned
    forward and bobbed up and down a couple of times. Regained control. But from now on she
    was just going to have to stay in control without any of that. Could she do it? She
    doubted she could, but somehow she was just going to have to manage.<br>
    <br>
    She ran down the steps and across the sand towards Andy. As she did so, she felt a couple
    more longish spurts of warm pee leak into her knickers. Struggled to control them without
    showing any signs of the struggle. It took longer than she thought it would. Little
    dribbles of pee ran down both her inner thighs. She hoped Andy wouldn't be looking there.
    Hoped that he wouldn't be looking at any part of her knickers that showed any signs of
    wetness.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let's go swimming!&quot; she yelled, running straight on past Andy. &quot;Last one
    to get their shoulders under is an over-ripe banana!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The effort of shouting was all it took. The strain on her diaphragm was too great. Her
    bladder gave way and as she passed Andy she felt the pee start to gush uncontrollably out
    and into her purple cotton knickers. If Andy looked now he was sure to see. Sure to know.
    She looked over her shoulder. He was racing after her. Not looking at her knickers at all.
    Unaware that she was wetting herself as she ran, pee pouring down both her legs. And now
    she was in the shallow water. Splashing as she went. Stamping down as hard as she could to
    raise the splashes up as high as she could. So Andy would expect her knickers to be wet.
    Wouldn't realise. She looked over her shoulder again. He had nearly caught her. Still she
    was pissing in her knickers. They were warm and soggy. It must be obvious to anybody who
    looked, and thought about it, what she was doing. Obvious that the water glistening on her
    plump little legs wasn't all cold seawater.<br>
    <br>
    And then she tripped and fell headlong into the ankle-deep water. Her face, tits, belly,
    crotch, thighs and knees all felt cold and wet. Her bum was still clear of the water. It
    felt warm and wet. It must be obvious that it was thoroughly soaked. And if Andy thought
    about it he must realise that such a soaking couldn't have come from just falling over in
    the shallows.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;That doesn't count!&quot; Andy called over his shoulder as he raced on past her.
    &quot;You can't get your shoulders under in that.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen struggled to her feet. She was still peeing. But now she was behind Andy. He
    couldn't see. And she couldn't care less. The fresh pee re-warming the crotch of her
    knickers and running away down the inside of her legs felt intensely erotic. Arousing. And
    now the water was above her knees and it was almost deep enough to swim. Ahead of her Andy
    had already got his shoulders under. Was turning to face her. She dived headlong into the
    waves, finally finishing her pee as she surfaced once more.<br>
    <br>
    There was Andy ahead of her. He wasn't much of a swimmer, and she knew she could catch him
    in no time.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Look out, then!&quot; she cried, as she felt the cold sea water chilling her
    knickers through, effectively concealing the last evidence of her latest accident so that
    Andy would never know. &quot;The over-ripe banana's coming to get you!&quot;<br>
