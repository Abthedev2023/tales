    Midsummer Day's Nap</strong></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="6"></font><font FACE="Arial"><p></font><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was the hottest day of the year, so naturally it
    was the day the air conditioner picked to conk out. Vicki and her daughter Nicki had to
    resort to such time honored standbys as ice cream, standing in front of the open fridge,
    and walking around in their underwear to keep cool. They&#146;d also taken to drinking
    large amounts of very cool soft drinks, cola for Nicki, homemade lemonade for her mother.
    Nicki tried to keep her fluid intake measured, knowing the consequences of overdoing it,
    but Vicki, a New Englander who hated Summer, always drank as much lemonade as she could
    manage on a hot day. Nicki watched her closely as she went through her usual daily
    routine, clearing up and washing the breakfast dishes, cleaning the house, preparing lunch
    and deciding on what would be for dinner. She was usually done with all of this by one in
    the afternoon, and in the process that day she had paused every once and again to fill a
    tall glass with icy lemonade and drink it down. By the time she called Nicki to lunch, the
    lemonade pitcher was half empty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">As they ate, Nicki asked: &quot;Mom, is it
    okay if I go to the mall?&quot;</font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Teenagers</i>, Vicki thought as she
    performed the usual interrogation. &quot;Who with?&quot;</font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Parents</i>, Nicki thought as she played
    along. &quot;I&#146;m gonna call Shari and Mindy and see if they can go.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;And what are you going to do
    there?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;The usual, hang out, shop&#151;&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Look for boys?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Mo-om! Look, they have <i>air
    conditioning</i> at the mall. It&#146;s <i>cool</i> at the mall. Can I please just
    go?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;All right, all right. Just don&#146;t
    shop too much. You almost gave me a heart attack with that last credit card bill.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Yes, Mom.&quot; Nicki said as she
    hurried through her lunch.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;And make sure you have your cell
    phone for emergencies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Yes, Mom.&quot; Nicki said as she
    left the table. She ran to her bedroom and dressed, then went to the bathroom for a quick
    pee. When she came back downstairs, her mother had finished with the lunch dishes and had
    set something out to defrost. Nicki watched from behind as Vicki stood at the sink and
    raised another full glass of lemonade to her lips.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Nicki watched with interest. Her mother
    tipped her head back as she drank, letting the cool fluid slip into her mouth. Nicki
    noticed that Vicki&#146;s feet shifted a little as she guzzled, first to the left, then
    the right. Then her left heel raised up as her left knee bent and closed in on the right.
    She held this stance for the few seconds it took to finish off the glass.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Nicki followed the lines of Vicki&#146;s
    body with her eyes. It occurred to her that she&#146;d never been this interested in the
    woman&#146;s looks before, but that pose held her gaze. Vicki was a very tall, slim woman,
    with a fashion figure and beautiful legs. Her choice of attire just brought more attention
    to her attributes. She was wearing a rather plain blue tank top with a pair of fancy
    white-lace panties and some pink slippers. The combination simply made you look, just to
    see what was under the jumble. For a moment, Nicki imagined what it must have been like
    for her father the first time he&#146;d seen Vicki similarly attired. She immediately
    shook the thought aside, because it led to others too gross for her to imagine. Besides,
    she now had something else on her mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I&#146;m gone, Mom.&quot; She said as
    Vicki sighed with satisfaction. The woman turned to face her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;If you&#146;re still there in an hour
    call me on my cell.&quot; Vicki said, putting her glass in the sink. &quot;I&#146;m going
    to take a nap on the patio, and that will wake me up.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Okay.&quot; Nicki said, already
    headed for the door. &quot;Bye-bye.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Vicki watched Nicki head out the door, then
    said a silent prayer of thanks for the hour or so of absolute peace and quiet she would
    enjoy. Determined to stay comfortable, she went out onto the patio in the back in just
    what she was wearing. The deck was enclosed, and just to discourage any peeping toms she
    closed the blinds covering the windows. She stretched her lanky body out on one of the
    patio chairs, resting her mobile phone on her stomach. It was the vibrating kind, and she
    was sure the sensation would wake her up if anyone called. She got into a relaxed
    position, and soon was fast asleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She woke up later feeling stiff and a
    little groggy. Her arms felt all knotted and tense, and her shoulders hurt. She attributed
    the feeling to circulation at first, and decided to wiggle her arms to get the blood
    flowing. The failure of the effort woke her up fully: She couldn&#146;t move her arms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">After a moment she realized why. They were
    hooked over the side of the chair, and it felt as if they were tied with a heavy duty
    cable. She tried to move her legs and felt the same sensation about her ankles. Someone
    had tied her to the chair, and though she couldn&#146;t see what bonds had been used she
    could tell it would be no use to try and slip out of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Vicki couldn&#146;t help but think the
    worst. <i>We&#146;ve been robbed! Someone immobilized me and broke in!</i> Her mind raced
    a mile a minute, trying to think of what to do. <i>Are they still here?</i> She strained
    but didn&#146;t hear anybody in the house. <i>Did Nicki come home and surprise them? Oh,
    God if she&#146;s hurt&#151;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She thought of her cell phone. It no longer
    lay on her stomach. It had slipped down, and was now resting on her pelvis. Vicki could
    feel it through the white lace. At once she realized it would do her no good, since she
    couldn&#146;t reach it or dial.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Then suddenly, the sensation in her pelvis
    changed. The feel of hard plastic was overshadowed by a sudden, internal heat and a fluid
    heaviness that pressed at her insides. Her pussy tingled and twitched, right around her
    peehole, and Vicki gasped as her bladder joined the rest of her body in awareness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; She said aloud.
    &quot;Oh, no&#151;not now!&quot; Nature was calling, and Vicki had no way to answer. All
    the lemonade had finally been turned into &quot;lemonade&quot; of the more vulgar kind and
    needed to complete its trip through Vicki&#146;s body. She strained at her bonds,
    wriggling her wrists and feet in an attempt to defeat them somehow, but it was no use. Her
    arms were completely useless, and she could only move her legs enough to close them tight.
    This she did, and pressed her slim ass into the material of the patio chair. She was
    stuck, and she winced as she imagined the disaster looming if she didn&#146;t get to a
    bathroom soon. Lemonade was her big weakness. It was perfect to cool her off on a hot day
    but she always drank too much, since she never stopped drinking until she felt the first
    twinges of a need to pee. Often she had that last glass at the wrong place and time and
    was left frantic to pee by the time she reached a toilet. Her piss would come out in a
    rush and take forever to completely get rid of. Sometimes she didn&#146;t quite make it,
    and would be dripping piss from between her legs long before she could sit down. Having
    slept only made the problem worse. Her strongest need to pee always came just after she
    woke up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Vicki tried to wiggle her ass in the seat,
    but could only move it an inch or so any way. That wouldn&#146;t help. There was no way to
    cross her legs or hold herself either. Her dignity was at the mercy of her bladder and her
    willpower.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Suddenly she had an ugly thought. Once
    again her attention was drawn to the phone resting on her pelvis. Part of it was resting
    over her bladder, and she just remembered it was set to vibrate, so the sensation would
    wake her. <i>Uh-oh. It would be really bad right now if...</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She squealed and squirmed as much as her
    bonds allowed as the mechanisms of the cell phone vibrated the case with a muffled hum,
    just as she thought of it, of course. It died after a few seconds, then trembled again,
    and then again. Each time it shook Vicki all the way through, swirling the pool of piss
    within her and bringing her ever closer to an accident. Whoever it was gave up after five
    buzzes, and Vicki tried to relax, laying back with her short black hair matted to her head
    with sweat, and tried to maintain control.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Then the vibrating started again, and when
    it just kept going the now frantic woman realized that the worst thing possible had
    happened. Her caller had decided to try paging her! The vibrations wouldn&#146;t stop
    until she turned off the feature and received the message!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Vicki started to sob as her whole body
    jiggled. She breathed and hissed through her teeth and her tits shook in their blue
    covering as she tried desperately to shift her position. She didn&#146;t have enough
    leverage to move the long chair, but she hoped to heaven she could move the phone. She had
    to hurry! She could feel the flow of piss in her urethra, and there was nothing preventing
    her from wetting her panties!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Slowly, agonizingly, the phone started to
    slide away from her bladder, but it was too late. Just as the phone tilted toward her hip,
    the flow became a gush, and hot fluid squirted out of her. The lacy crotch of her
    underwear was immediately drenched, and several ounces of her piss coated her pussy and
    the insides of her thighs as it splashed part of the phone and dropped through to the
    finished hardwood of the deck. She managed to get control of herself only after she
    wriggled enough to tip the phone over the side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was temporary respite. She could still
    feel the fluid heat of her piss right inside her peehole, poised to spray out at any time.
    The wetness of her crotch just made it worse. The feel of it was subconsciously enticing
    her to just let go, but she couldn&#146;t let herself do it. &quot;Help me!!&quot; She
    screamed out at the top of her lungs. &quot;Somebody please help me!!&quot; It was no use.
    Her closest neighbors were all out of the state for the summer, and no one else could hear
    her from inside the enclosure. She kept wiggling in despair, praying for a miracle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Mom?&quot; Nicki&#146;s voice called
    out. Vicki sobbed for joy. Nicki wasn&#146;t hurt, and she&#146;d be free any minute.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I&#146;m on the patio!&quot; The
    mother called back. &quot;Hurry, please!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She heard running footsteps coming closer,
    then Nicki was at her side. &quot;Are you all right, Mom?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I&#146;m so glad to see you! I think
    we were robbed! Untie me...please! I have to go to the bathroom before I check to see if
    anything&#146;s missing!&quot; She kept squirming as she spoke. If she sat still, she was
    sure she&#146;d pee all over the place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Nicki ducked down out of sight, and Vicki
    felt her manipulate the bonds around her hands. &quot;This is really tight. Did you have
    an accident?&quot; Nicki said. She could see the small puddle Vicki had left.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;A little one.&quot; Vicki said,
    embarrassed. &quot;You&#146;ve gotta hurry, Nicki! I still have to go! I can&#146;t hold
    it in anymore!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; Nicki said.
    Vicki didn&#146;t notice the tone in her voice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;You know how much I have to pee when
    I drink so much lemonade, sweetie! Mommy&#146;s bursting!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Suddenly Nicki was no longer working on the
    bonds. Vicki looked up to see her daughter rise, holding Vicki&#146;s cell phone in one
    hand. The girl turned off the pager and placed it back on her mother&#146;s pelvis. Then
    she took out her own cell phone and typed in a number and a message. She then moved the
    phone so that Vicki could see her number on the screen. Nicki&#146;s thumb was poised over
    the &quot;Send&quot; button.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Vicki looked up again, and saw the evil
    smirk on Nicki&#146;s face. In the other hand, Nicki held two silvery objects&#151;the
    keys to the bicycle locks she had tied her mother down with.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Now that I have your attention,&quot;
    she said, &quot;let&#146;s talk about my allowance.&quot;</font></p>
