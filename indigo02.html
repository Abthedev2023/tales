    <br>
    &quot;Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say,&quot; said Helen, taking the last slice of
    pizza from the box.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jolly fun,&quot; mimicked Andy. &quot;When did you start talking like that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I didn't,&quot; said Helen. &quot;I was quoting a song. Don't you know it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; said Andy, popping the cork on the bottle of cheap sparkling white wine.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Garden Party. Marillion,&quot; she prompted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never heard of it, or them. And anyway, we're not going punting on the Cam. We're
    going punting on the Granta.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I thought there was only one river in Cambridge,&quot; mumbled Helen through a
    mouthful of dough, tomato, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is,&quot; said Andy, taking a swig of wine and passing the bottle to Helen.
    &quot;And it changes name at that weir over there. Below the weir is the Cam. Above it is
    the Granta or Rhee.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen swallowed the last of the pizza and took a mouthful of wine.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So why aren't we going on the Cam?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Because I want to show you Byron's Pool,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Still in the lonely
    midnight waters cool / His ghostly lordship swims the pool / and tries the strokes, essays
    the tricks / Long learned on Hellespont, or Styx.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You what?&quot; said Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I was quoting a poem,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Don't you know it?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No.&quot; Helen shook her head and took another swig of wine.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Rupert Brooke,&quot; said Andy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never heard of him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Old Vicarage, Grantchester.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never heard of it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's where Jeffrey Archer lives when he's not in prison,&quot; said Andy,
    despairingly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, I've heard of him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You really are a Philistine, aren't you?&quot; teased Andy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You're the one who thinks showing a girl a good time means sharing a takeaway pizza
    and a bottle of cheap wine,&quot; retorted Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah well,&quot; said Andy, &quot;punt hire ain't exactly cheap, you know.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah well,&quot; mimicked Helen.<br>
    <br>
    Knowing Andy and Helen, this scintillating intellectual discussion could have carried on
    all afternoon if other events hadn't intervened. But other events did intervene. They had
    now arrived at the head of the queue; so Andy paid his deposit and took the ticket round
    to the landing stage where the boatman offered him a heavy, 16-foot wooden punt pole.<br>
    <br>
    Andy shook his head. &quot;That one's too furry. Haven't you got one in better
    condition?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The boatman offered a second pole, and again Andy shook his head. Then he cast his eye
    over the stack of waiting poles and pointed to another.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll take that one.&quot; The boatman passed Andy the pole he had indicated and Andy
    walked deftly out along a waiting punt to the platform at the far end of the vessel, where
    he stood and waited for Helen. The punt rocked gently from side to side as he walked along
    it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It looks a little unstable,&quot; said Helen.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's fine,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Just step onto the platform, walk along the center
    line, and plonk yourself down on one of the cushions facing me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You have such a way with words, Andy,&quot; said Helen. &quot;Plonk myself down
    indeed!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The boatman took Helen's elbow and steadied her as she stepped hesitantly out onto the
    platform. The punt rocked alarmingly, and she jumped forward and fell into a tumbled heap
    on the plastic-covered cushions in the middle of the vessel, narrowly avoiding spilling
    the wine as she did so. She had just started to sort herself out and sit herself up, when
    the punt gave another great lurch as the boatman pushed it off and out into the river.
    Then a third lurch came which toppled her into a flailing heap of arms and legs as Andy
    skillfully dug the pole deep into the mud at the bottom of the river and brought the
    motion of the vessel under control.<br>
    <br>
    It was a bright sunny day in mid July, and Helen was wearing one of her short summer
    dresses. She liked teasing and tantalizing the boys with these dresses, giving them the
    impression that if they kept watching long enough they might catch a glimpse of her
    knickers; but she seldom if ever allowed them such a glimpse. As she sorted herself out
    and sat herself back up, however, she realized that she must have shown just about
    everything she'd got to just about anyone who was watching, including Andy, so there was
    little point in playing coy and dignified now. Instead she decided to adopt Plan B: that
    morning she'd carefully chosen matching coral pink knickers and bra, which could easily
    pass as a bikini, so she casually took her dress off and lay back on the cushion.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Lovely day,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I think I'll soak up a bit of the sun and
    improve my tan.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Be my guest,&quot; said Andy, wondering to himself whether that really was a bikini
    she was wearing, or whether it was just ordinary knickers and a bra.<br>
    <br>
    Andy certainly knew how to punt, Helen realized as they made steady progress up the river.
    During the first twenty minutes or so they passed punt after punt of clueless tourists,
    screaming and yelling and ramming one another as they struggled to control the unfamiliar
    and unwieldy craft. Yet never once did they collide with any of these tourists. With a
    deft flick of his wrists, Andy steered his own punt away from them and around them. She
    also noticed that the inexperienced punters seemed to shower their passengers with river
    water every time they lifted the pole; yet in twenty minutes she had not suffered so much
    as a splash.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You're good at this,&quot; she said appreciatively, as she drained the last of the
    wine.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I've told you,&quot; Andy replied, &quot;I had a misspent youth.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Will you teach me?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you like,&quot; he replied. &quot;Come up onto the deck here and stand in front
    of me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen stood up, and the punt immediately lurched over to one side. Andy easily absorbed
    the rolling motion by flexing his knees, but in her slightly drunken state Helen nearly
    toppled over the side of the punt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oops,&quot; she said, sitting heavily back down again. &quot;Maybe not now. Tell you
    what - I'll try again a bit later, when there are fewer people looking.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And so they continued up the river for another half an hour or so; gradually the number of
    other vessels they encountered dwindled until it seemed theirs was the only punt on the
    river, and as they left Cambridge behind them the crowds of people on the riverbanks
    steadily thinned out too.<br>
    <br>
    When they had been on the river for perhaps an hour, Helen began to be aware that the wine
    she had been drinking was rapidly making its way into her bladder. And once she'd noticed
    it, she also began to realize that it was building up there at an alarming rate. She was
    also feeling somewhat tipsy, having consumed, as she now realized, by far the greater part
    of the bottle of wine. Perhaps because of this she wasn't all that concerned about the
    signals she was receiving from her bladder. After all, she reasoned, Andy must have
    realized that she'd need to go to the loo at some point, and doubtless he had it all under
    control.<br>
    <br>
    So she settled back into the cushions and grinned up at Andy. She watched the steady,
    rhythmic sway of his body as he lifted the pole to its full height, threw it down into the
    murky waters and shoved against the riverbed to give them forward momentum. She listed to
    the steady watery slap - slap - slap under the bows of the punt as it fought its way up
    against the current and the gentle gurgling hiss of the current as it flowed down past the
    sides of the punt. As she did so she became uncomfortably aware of the building pressure
    in her bladder again, and no matter how hard she tried to concentrate on other things
    instead- the sounds of the river kept bringing it back into the forefront of her mind.<br>
    <br>
    She really did need to go to the toilet, she realized, subconsciously crossing her legs.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Andy,&quot; she said. &quot;How much further is it now?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We're a little over half way there, I reckon.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; she said, a little over half way there? As in, still about an hour of
    hissing, gurgling, slapping water noises to make her bladder uncomfortable? She'd never
    make it. She was going to have to find a toilet first. She hated to admit her weakness to
    Andy; but the choices seemed to be either asking him to find her a toilet or wet herself.
    And however unthinkable the first one seemed, the second was even more so.<br>
    <br>
    And yet... and yet...<br>
    <br>
    She REALLY didn't want to ask him. It wasn't a subject she felt comfortable discussing
    with him. They'd been going out for about three months now. They'd kissed, they'd indulged
    in a certain amount of sexual foreplay, but so far as she was aware they were both still
    virgins (well, she certainly was) and they'd never seen each other naked. She'd teased him
    by giving him tantalizing glimpses of her knickers or her breasts from time to time; but
    this was the first time she'd stripped to her underwear for him (and as far as he was
    aware it was in any event a bikini, which was altogether different). They'd never really
    discussed going to the toilet and bodily functions; and several times she'd come back from
    a date absolutely bursting for a wee because she didn't want to tell him that she needed a
    toilet during the date.<br>
    <br>
    Another fifteen minutes or so couldn't hurt, could it? Perhaps the urgency would ease a
    bit, and she would find that she really could hold on. Perhaps.<br>
    <br>
    She crossed her legs the other way. Then back the first way. Then she turned over to lie
    on her stomach, alternately bending and straightening her knees. This was a good position
    in some respects, because she could slip a hand underneath herself and hold her crotch
    without being noticed; but it was a bad position in other respects because she was lying
    on her bladder, which was increasing her discomfort. In the end she decided she was better
    off on her back and turned over again. But she couldn't get comfortable, and whichever way
    she crossed her legs she couldn't ease the pressure in her bladder the way she had before
    she turned onto her stomach. Indeed, the fact was that she was really bursting. She was
    going to have to wee soon, whether she wanted to or not. She was not going to be able to
    hold on until Byron's Pool. So perhaps she should say something to Andy.<br>
    <br>
    Or perhaps not- perhaps she could still hold on. Perhaps the sweat that was beading on her
    brow was there because it was a hot, sunny day and she was ever so slightly tipsy. Perhaps
    it had nothing to do with the fact that she needed to pee. Soon. VERY soon.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You aren't half jiffling,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Anybody would think you were trying
    to upset the punt and tip me into the river.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Is everything alright, Helen?&quot; he asked.<br>
    <br>
    Now was the time to tell him. Now was the time to confess that she was fidgeting like a
    nine year old that was about to wet her knickers because she was ... well ... a nineteen
    year old that was about to wet her knickers. Only she felt too shy to say it. And whereas
    a nine year old who was this desperate probably would wet her knickers if she didn't get
    to a toilet soon, she felt sure that if she tried she really COULD hold on. She just had
    to try.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm fine,&quot; she mumbled, and crossed her legs the other way, and tried to sit
    still for Andy.<br>
    <br>
    And sitting still made it worse. The pressure in her bladder was all she could think
    about. And the hiss and gurgle of the current and the slap - slap - slap of the bows kept
    making her think of going to the toilet, and what a blessed relief it would be if she
    could.<br>
    <br>
    But she couldn't.<br>
    <br>
    Not here.<br>
    <br>
    And she couldn't say anything to Andy. Could she?<br>
    <br>
    Well, perhaps she could. Perhaps she should. Perhaps ...<br>
    <br>
    WAAAK WAAAK WAAAK WAAAK WAAAK WAAAK! <br>
    <br>
    With a clattering splash of wings on water, a startled duck fled from under the bows of
    the punt. It startled Helen, too. So much so that she very nearly lost control of herself.
    She so very nearly started to pee there and then. She just managed to keep in control, but
    it was a close run thing. And it made up her mind for her, because another surprise like
    that and she was sure she would be in trouble.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Andy,&quot; she said falteringly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes?&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    But her nerve deserted her, just as a sudden spasm ripped through her bladder forcing a
    short jet of warm pee out into her knickers. Her face burned as it turned crimson with
    embarrassment, and she sat rigid while she fought to control her tortured bladder. She
    managed to hold it at that, and prayed that Andy hadn't seen anything. But she couldn't
    mention her need to go to the toilet. She really couldn't. And she certainly couldn't tell
    him that she had already started to wet herself. What would he think?<br>
    <br>
    And then inspiration struck.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Andy,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you think I could have another go at punting
    now?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Andy smiled.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Of course you can,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, stand up very carefully, and don't try
    moving until you have found your balance.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen stood up, very VERY carefully. She was being so very careful because she still
    needed to hold back her pee for a few moments longer, but even standing up might be more
    than her tortured bladder could take. Andy, of course, thought that she was just being
    very careful to keep her balance.<br>
    <br>
    She made it upright with no more leaks.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good,&quot; said Andy. &quot;Now walk back here to me, carefully, one step at a
    time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Helen took a faltering step. As she did so, another short jet of pee escaped into her damp
    knickers. Still Andy would be unable to see this, as he was standing somewhat higher than
    her up on the deck. But Helen felt sure that any more leaks would send a trickle of pee
    running down her legs, and Andy would surely see that. So now was the time to put her
    desperate plan into action.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh Andy!&quot; she yelped, and leaned abruptly over to one side. The punt rocked
    with her, and she let its motion carry her with it and topple her over the vessel's low
    side and into the river with a mighty splash.<br>
    <br>
    The river water was cold. Far colder than she had imagined, and as it closed around her
    she lost all semblance of bladder control. The warm pee flowed out into her knickers,
    warming her crotch and her thighs. But she was safe. Nobody could see it. Nobody else need
    ever know about her accident. It would be her secret. Blessed relief!<br>
    <br>
    She surfaced and looked about her, treading water, still peeing. There was the punt. There
    was Andy, looking worriedly in her direction. She raised an arm and waved to him.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oops!&quot; she said. &quot;I just don't seem to have the balance for this punting
    lark, do I?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As soon as she had finished peeing, she struck out for the punt. She was a strong swimmer,
    and in no time Andy's well-muscled arms were helping her back aboard the punt.<br>
    <br>
    Andy decided to turn back and show her Byron's Pool another day. And it was just as well
    he did, because by the time they got back to the punt station and the public toilets next
    to it, the sun had dried Helen's clothes out and she was getting pretty close to wetting
    herself for a second time. She didn't, however, and Andy never discovered that his
    girlfriend had wet her knickers before his very eyes without his even noticing.<br>
