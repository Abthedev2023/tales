      <br><span lang="EN">
      <div><br>The following happened on a hiking trip in August 2012; it is 
      true to the best of my recollections. I have the permission of the woman 
      in this story to post this online with her name changed (she recently 
      learned about my fetish):<br><br>Four of us went on a long hiking trip 
      (about 15 miles) in a region that is mostly above treeline, leaving early 
      in the day on our adventure. Three of us were male and one hiker was 
      female. Although this hike was long, it was in a remote area and had 
      relatively few bathrooms (one at the start and 2 others at 4 miles and 6 
      miles in - leaving about 10 miles without a bathroom). The hike organizer 
      (call him "Chris") made it clear that this was the case - with the 
      implication being that we would use random rock outcroppings or tree cover 
      to "do our business." Chris was amazing at planning the hike and included 
      full size water proof maps, trail descriptions as well as a list of 
      possible issues (for example a river crossing over stepping stones, rough 
      rocky trail sections, and infamously a large section without "facilities" 
      as he put it). We all agreed on the route and were all excited. As far as 
      the region with no facilities, the three guys in the group had all hiked 
      together before and were quite comfortable peeing outdoors. <br><br>The 
      first part of the hike went as planned - we hiked from the valley over the 
      river to above treeline and had amazing views of all the surrounding 
      mountains. We stopped at the picnic/shelter/rest areas at 4 and 6 miles, 
      eating lunch at the second area (and all using the bathrooms). As the day 
      was hot, we were all drinking quite a bit. <br><br>The trail for the next 
      several miles primarily followed a rocky ridge with generally no cover 
      except an occasional outcropping. Despite the fairly open terrain, I and 
      my male compatriots made use of cover off the trail. At one section, about 
      11 miles into our hike, we took a rest at a rather large outcropping where 
      we rested, ate, and Chris took care of his business. <br><br>It was at 
      this point that I noticed "Samantha" (the name changed female member of 
      our group) looking a bit nervous and flush in the face. It should be noted 
      that despite multiple opportunities she never made use of the rock 
      outcroppings. Although she was not explicitly holding herself, it seemed 
      clear from her body language that she needed to pee. I must admit that I 
      am turned on by seeing women need to pee (and poppin a squat), but I 
      didn't want my close friend to pee herself. Not bold enough to ask if she 
      needed to pee I went up to her and said: "Is everything all right?"; I 
      half expected her to admit her situation, at which point I would strongly 
      encourage her to use this large outcropping. However, she responds: "I'm 
      fine. This has been a long hike." With nothing left to say, we soon headed 
      on, but for me the next couple of miles were awkward. I was sure she had 
      to pee, but perhaps was embarrassed to use the less covering rocks above 
      tree line. I knew in just 2 miles we would begin to dip below treeline and 
      if she really did need to pee, she would then.<br><br>As we continued on 
      her body langauge further indicated her need to pee. Her thighs were 
      squeezed together and her pace was shorter. Despite cloud cover coming in 
      and lowering the temperatures, she was quite flush and almost had a tear 
      in her eye. I knew she had to pee, and I couldn't understand why she 
      tortured herself.<br><br>After what seemed like an eternity, we finally 
      made it to the first bits of tree cover. The trail descended into a thin 
      patch of trees about 5 feet tall, thin but extending back at least 100 
      feet, providing at least a bit of cover. There were plenty of spots just 
      30 feet back with essentially complete cover. I stopped to get some water 
      and some food, expecting her to use this opportunity to declare "I'm going 
      to go pee, wait a sec guys." However she didn't. It was at this point I 
      began to doubt if I had read her body cues right.<br><br>We continued on 
      and about 15 minutes later we stopped at an overlook just at treeline. If 
      I had to estimate I would say that this was about 5 hours after we left 
      the lunch spot --- the trail had been rough and it was tough to go even 1 
      mi/hr (normally on our group hikes we are flying at 3+ mi/hr) -- despite 
      this time we had at least 3 miles before getting back to the hiking lodge. 
      We all sat down to rest (we were all tired at this point) and Samantha was 
      sitting on her foot next to me. Not more than 30 seconds later she let out 
      a squeak. We all looked over and she just grabbed herself. Looking more 
      embarassed than I have ever seen someone look (she was bright red), she 
      just held herself while pee leaked out onto the rock slowly. It dribbled 
      out of her shorts and through her fingers. It was clear she was trying, 
      but failing to hold back the flow. <br><br>While I felt extremely 
      embarassed for her, I could not help but feel turned on. Her hiking shorts 
      were rather small and tight (it looked like spandex material with the 
      shorts no more than about 4 inches down from the crotch), and the pee was 
      just flowing out not 3 feet away from me. <br><br>After 10-15 seconds of 
      struggling, she finally got off the rock, hobbled to the side of the trail 
      and just released a torrent of pee directly through her shorts. She 
      squatted there with both hands buried in her face shaking in 
      embarrassment. Her legs were spread wide, and a distinct stream could be 
      seen pouring out of her shorts onto the packed dirt of the trail. &nbsp; I 
      couldn't help but stare the entire time. My eyes were glued to her shorts 
      as the squat really accentuated all her lines and the clarity of the 
      stream really turned me on (we were and still are just friends but she is 
      very attractive and fit - a combination I love in a woman). After what 
      seemed like forever, her stream finally slowed down. She squeezed out two 
      more small spurts. She slowly lowered her hands down her face and peered 
      at us and looked down at the damage. Her spandex shorts were black and the 
      pee stain was really rather subtle. The puddle on the ground, though, was 
      massive - four to five feet long down the trail. She stood up and said 
      nothing. We all just tried to avert our eyes. I tried to say something 
      reassuring, but all that I could say was "I'm sorry".<br><br>This simple 
      statement diffused the immense awkwardness of the situation and we 
      continued. Later on down the trail, we got to talking and she admitted 
      that she was embarrassed to say she had needed to pee. We all apologized 
      again, and made it clear that she can feel comfortable around us even when 
      discussing her bodily functions. <br><br>We never discussed this incident 
      outside of our group. Everything has worked out.&nbsp; A couple weekends 
      later we went on a 6 miles hike (3 of us - me, Chris, and Samantha) and 
      she used the forest cover about 5 miles in. None of us said anything, but 
      I think we all learned a lesson in open 
      communication.<br><br>------------------<br></div>
      <div>
      <div>Since writing the story, I spoke to Samantha about this incident. 
      This was her first hike with a super-extended section (&gt;5 hours) 
      without facilities. She is a marathon runner and will go for hours without 
      peeing while still drinking plenty at the water stops. She recalls that 2 
      months before our hike that she completed a marathon in 4.5 hours (plus 40 
      minutes waiting on the line) and didn't even feel desperate when she 
      finished. Before this hike she had gone on several 5 hour hikes without 
      stopping for a break (others used the trees but she didn't). It wasn't 
      that she thought those that those who used the forest were wrong, but she 
      just could not see herself using the forest. Also, she had an incredibly 
      strong bladder. She never peed her pants or leaked before the hike on that 
      day. At college she would frequently realize at dinner that this was her 
      first visit to the bathroom since leaving her room that morning (perhaps 8 
      hours later). It does not come as a surprise then, that she was not at all 
      worried about the hike. On the hike up, she drank her normal amount (16+ 
      ounces per hour), she said. At the first rest stop at 4 miles (about 2.5 
      hours) she was not even tempted to use the bathroom and at 6 miles (about 
      4 hours) she just had a moderate need even though she had downed nearly 
      all of her three liter bottles of water. Nothing seemed out of the 
      ordinary. She filled up both of her 1.5 liter bottles before heading out. 
      As we walked above treeline she continued to drink her ordinary amount. 
      <br><br></div>
      <div>Samantha says the key problem was that she was expected the 9 mile 
      journey to take about 5-6 hours based on our pace up to that point. She 
      had not studied the map too well, but did note that we left the lunch spot 
      a bit before noon. About 11 miles in - 5 miles since lunch (at the large 
      outcropping), the time was about 4pm. She expected that we had maybe 1-2 
      hours left. The water from the morning and the afternoon was apparently 
      catching up to her, and she had a "moderate need" for the bathroom 
      (however from my perspective at that point it was very obvious that she 
      needed to pee -- sorry Samantha you really are not that subtle :P ). She 
      was still not apparently worried at all and thought it would be easy to 
      hold it another couple of hours; her only change was to stop drinking 
      water at this point (a bit late as she already downed 2 liters). We 
      continued on with her enjoyment of the hike diminishing as her bladder 
      needs increased. As we descended, she kept looking at her watch and by 
      5:40 we had progressed below treeline. She was sure that we were just 
      minutes from the hiking lodge where we started the loop. When we got to 
      the next lookout (where the incident occurred) I apparently pointed out 
      "Hey look -- there is our lodge" (it was about 1.5 or 2 miles away). This 
      demoralized Samantha. She was "desperate" to pee at this point and had 
      conceded to herself that she would pee at the next better wooded 
      opportunity - because there was no way she could hold it for 2 miles 
      (little did she know she would not be able to hold it for 2 minutes). She 
      sat on the rock on her foot "to help with the pressure". She was waiting 
      for us to finish up our break, when something that "never happened before" 
      just happened. "I was sitting there when suddenly pee just came out. I 
      couldn't stop it." She said that she just freaked out and did not know 
      what to do. It was not something she ever expected to happen and she was 
      super embarrassed.<br>
