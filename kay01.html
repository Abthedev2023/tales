    I have been a 'wetter' since i was about 12 - I am 26 now and still wet myself more than
    once a week! I used to think I was strange, but when I got the internet a couple of months
    ago i realized that there were plenty of girls like me, and plenty of guys who like it...<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Also, since I found your site I have been a little bolder about where I wet myself - I
    used to do most of it at home, like in the back or front yard - there were times I did it
    'publicly', but I have been doing it a whole lot more in the past month! I have always
    been a bit of a showoff - I like to wear short skirts and sometimes even flash my panties
    or butt at guys, but now I like to pee outside too.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    So I though you might like to know about my last experience -yesterday in fact! I was in
    town at lunch time doing the Xmas shopping thingy, and decided to sit in a park for a
    break - a couple of times I had attempted to go pee, but the lines to the ladies' room
    were too long so I just held it. <o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I finally got to sit down, and was starting the drink I had just bought when I <o:p></o:p>remembered
    my need! Shit! There are no toilets in the park where I was (they have been closed for
    years) and none in the next one over either - I was at least a 5-10 minute walk from the
    closest toilet. To top it off, I had sat near a 'water feature' (who thinks of these dumb
    names anyway?)!<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I knew then that I would be peeing somewhere near there - but there were a few too many
    people around just to pull down my panties and let it go - and there were no real
    'corners' or bushes to hide in, so I made up my mind.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I pulled my skirt out from under me, and also up a little at the front- I could tell you
    could see my panties if you walked in the right spot from the look on a couple of guys
    eyes as they went passed! Damn that turns me on! They also walked past about 5 times each
    (there were two of them) until I looked right at them and they didn't come back! I am not
    that scary I thought...<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I then spread my legs a little, bent my knees and let it go, right through my
    panties. Oh man - I can't tell you what the relief was like, also how turned on I was
    getting flashing and peeing in the park!<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Once I was done, i gave myself a good rub (I told myself it was to get some of the pee
    out, but I certainly enjoyed it), and maybe rubbed a little too long. I was turned on like
    nothing else - I think if someone had come up to me and proposing sex on the spot I would
    have just laid down and spread for them there!<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    So there we go. I was having so much fun though, that i sat there and ate my lunch, with
    my freshly wet panties out for the world to see...<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    Damn I love to pee.<br>
