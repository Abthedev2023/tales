    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a Saturday night, Jane and
    Lori had come to the big city for a week long holiday and tonight they had hooked up with
    2 guys, Brad and Justin, that they had met at the club downtown. They knew that neither of
    them would be able to drive, so Jane and Lori had left their car at Jane's cousin's house
    where they were staying. They had been drinking for about 4 hours- and just recently had a
    couple of pitchers of beer. They knew that the last bus ran at 2:15am and they would have
    to make it or have no way home, as a person could never get a taxi at that time of night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The guys were also taking the bus,
    but in the opposite direction, and said that their last bus would run 1:55am. It was
    getting close to that time when Justin brought back another pitcher, and so they polished
    it off quickly. None of them had visited the bathroom in the last hour before it was time
    to leave, and Jane noticed that there was a huge lineup like always for the ladies. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When they got out onto the street,
    they all realized how drunk they really were. Jane and Lori had already discussed which
    guy they liked more, luckily Jane liked Justin and Lori liked Brad, so everything seemed
    to be working out perfectly for the foursome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't think that we will
    make our bus, in fact we will be lucky if we can catch yours&quot; Brad said, sobering up
    for a brief moment. &quot;Come on we have got to walk faster!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lori was already feeling the need to
    pee and knew that walking faster would not help her. They were about a block away from
    their stop when they saw the bus getting closer; they made a run for it and just made it
    as the bus was pulling up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Is this the last bus?&quot;
    Jane asked, hoping that it wasn't because she really did need to find a place to piss
    before the long bus ride.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes it is, get in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They all got on and went to the back
    of the bus, it was dark and there were not very many people on it at this late hour. They
    were flirting and playing around with each other for a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jane knew that they still had a good
    40 minutes ahead of them and was already feeling pretty desperate to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;God, I have to pee so
    bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lori laughed nervously and said
    &quot;Me too!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I think we all had quite a bit
    to drink and everyone needs to pee quite badly,&quot; Justin said. &quot;How much longer
    until we get to your place?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lori said that it was about 20-25
    minutes. Jane was not sure if she really thought that or was just trying to make it seem
    better than it was. After a few minutes Jane had her legs crossed and Lori was squirming
    in her seat. Justin was squeezing himself when he thought no one was looking. Jane had
    begun to feel incredible desperation; she could never hold it for long especially when
    drinking beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We have got to try to make it
    as far as possible so we won't have to walk too far,&quot; she said, thinking out loud. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, I have never had to pee so
    bad&quot; Lori cried now, openly holding herself. Jane knew that they still had another 25
    minutes and didn't think that any of them would make it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We just have to get off and
    piss in a bush,&quot; Brad said now openly holding himself as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You have to wait until we can
    go too, we cannot just go in the open like you guys,&quot; Lori said, batting her eyes at
    Brad. After a few minutes the two couples were making out, making it easier for the guys
    to hold it in but not much more comfortably. That only lasted so long because each one was
    in a private battle with their bladder. They managed to make it within a couple of stops
    before Lori said that they had to get off here, she was going to piss herself. She was
    bent over and holding on with all her strength. Normally Jane would be enjoying her
    friend's predicament but she had to go too badly herself to wait much longer. They all
    agreed, rang the bell and prepared to get off. Standing up only made it worse, and they
    were all holding themselves- making it very obvious to anyone on the bus what was wrong.
    They got off and the street was very well lit and still had quite a few people walking
    around. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We can't pee here, it is too
    open, come on, we will find an alley or something,&quot; Jane said, taking the lead while
    feeling the pee about to escape her small body. She was at the point where she had to hold
    herself continuously just to keep it in and she knew she didn't have much time left.
    Justin had just been about to whip it out and piss but hearing Jane say to follow her he
    pinched it off just barely and quickly followed her, holding himself the whole way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They found a small park and as they
    began to cross the street Lori bent over and groaned: &quot;Oh, I am going to pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Brad grabbed her hand and pulled her
    across to the park &quot;You have made it this far you have to hold it a minute
    longer.&quot; They got into the park and found a paved area behind some trees, it was
    their best option and they all prepared to finally let go. Lori began to pee in her
    panties so she quickly pulled them down to unleash a giant torrent of piss, for the others
    this was too much. Brad scrambled to open his pants just barely getting it out before a
    trickle escaped followed by a huge stream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jane lifted her skirt to pee and
    immediately joined Lori's puddle. &quot;Oh that feels so good,&quot; she cried. Jane
    noticed that Justin had not yet peed and asked him why. He blushed a little and explained
    that the sight of them peeing had turned him on and couldn't pee. He said that he would
    just need a minute as he adjusted his pants. When the others were finished they decided to
    stay in the park for a while, as they seemed to be the only ones there. They split up into
    couples and went to different areas of the park. When Justin and Jane were alone she
    immediately started to kiss him and he did not put up a fight. He had still been holding
    himself but was now forced to let go. He wanted her so badly that he was able to put his
    urge to piss in the back of his mind. Jane enjoyed knowing that he still had to pee and
    wanted to see how desperate he would get. She was on top, straddling him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He moaned: &quot;Oh I have to pee,
    but this feels so good.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jane whispered to him that she
    wanted him so bad. He lifted her skirt up to reveal her beautiful body and he told her
    that he wanted her too. She undid his pants revealing the proof that he did want her. Jane
    had never seen someone so hard. She kissed his stomach and then his penis. He was shaking,
    it felt so good but he could not relax because of his desperation. Jane lifted up to face
    him and slowly slid down onto his rock hard penis. Almost immediately she began to orgasm
    and Justin was not far behind, he felt like he would explode when he came inside her. They
    clung to each other in ecstasy and as he began to lose his erection the need to pee came
    flooding back, and combined with the pressure on his bladder from Jane sitting there he
    began to piss inside of her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh no, I am sorry, I can't
    stop it now,&quot; he apologized to her as his stream got stronger gushing all over her
    thighs and pussy. Jane didn't mind at all, in fact it completely turned her on, she
    directed his stream towards her clit and began to orgasm again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
