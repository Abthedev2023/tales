    </font><br><br>Janet and Sarah were relaxing on sunbeds near the 
      pool on the first day of their holiday in Spain. Despite having arrived 
      late that morning, they had managed to get loungers in the sun close to 
      the pool and the poolside bar. After a couple of hours or so, Sarah was 
      really feeling the effects of all the drinks they had had on the plane and 
      in the airport bar whilst waiting to board. The bottles of water they had 
      drunk after arriving didn't help.
      <br>
      <br>"How're you doing?" she asked Janet.<br><br>"I'm a bit desperate." Janet replied "What about you?"<br><br>"I'm fine." Sarah said.
      <br>
      <br>"No I'm not, shall we call this one a draw 
      and make a dash for the loo?"
      <br>
      <br>"If we do we'll lose these sunbeds" 
      commented Janet
      <br>
      <br>"If we don't I'll wet myself" said Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"Well that's the other option." said Janet 
      with a grin. "In fact that's what I'm going to do."
      <br>
      <br>"But what about the sunbeds?" asked Sarah 
      "Won't they get wet?"
      <br>
      <br>"Of course they will, but it doesn't 
      matter, they get wet with water from the pool." replied Janet. "And before 
      you ask, the same goes for bikinis and swimming costumes."
      <br>
      <br>After a bit of thought Sarah said "OK, but 
      we'll call this one a draw."
      <br>
      <br>"No way" said Janet, "If we're going to 
      wet ourselves anyway, we can take this to the end and see who can really 
      hold the longest."
      <br>
      <br>"Right, you're on." said Sarah, although 
      she didn't think that she could last many minutes more.
      <br>
      <br>In fact it was only 10 minutes later that 
      she couldn't hold on any longer and felt the first spurt.
      <br>
      <br>At that very moment Janet said "OK, you 
      win".
      <br>
      <br>"To be fair, I've just spurted." admitted 
      Sarah "so I guess that it really is a draw."
      <br>
      <br>With that they both let go and completely 
      emptied themselves. They had only just finished when the barman appeared 
      beside them and asked if he could get them anything from the bar.
      <br>
      <br>"We're not on the 'all in' " said Janet.
      <br>
      <br>"That's OK." said the barman, "I have some 
      leeway, and as long as you continue what you've been doing, I'll keep you 
      in drinks."
      <br>
      <br>"I'm Josef." he added.
      <br>
      <br>"That's very nice." said Janet "Thanks. 
      I'm Janet and this is Sarah."
      <br>
      <br>"Pleases to meet you." said Josef. "I'll 
      just get your drinks. What would you like?"
      <br>
      <br>"If we're drinking a lot it had better be 
      mineral waters please." said Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"That's fine." said Josef, "I'll be right 
      back."
      <br>
      <br>He returned a few minutes later with the 
      drinks and put them down on the floor between the sunbeds. "By the way, 
      what's your room number?" he asked.
      <br>
      <br>"I thought that these were free" said 
      Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"Oh they are." said Josef, "But the maids 
      like to know in which rooms the beds are likely to need protection." he 
      explained, adding that "I keep my eyes open for the signs and let them 
      know. In return they perform at a bar down town where there's a 'Holding' 
      contest every Wednesday night.
      <br>
      <br>"Thanks for the drinks" said Sarah, "Oh 
      and Wednesday nights sound fun. Can we come as well?"
      <br>
      <br>"Of course" said Josef "Have you done that 
      sort of thing before?"
      <br>
      <br>"Yes" admitted Janet, "But today's the 
      first time that we've actually gone this far and wet ourselves. We always 
      make sure that there is a loo nearby and rush in at the last moment. At 
      least we thought that it was the last moment, but today we lasted much 
      longer than we expected."
      <br>
      <br>"Anyway, tell us about Wednesday 
      nights."asked Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"It's quite simple." said Josef, "The last 
      one to wet herself wins first prize. There are two other prizes, one for 
      the best performance and the booby prize for the first one to wet herself. 
      At the start of the contest, everyone has to drink a litre of water within 
      5 minutes followed by a half litre every quarter of an hour, again within 
      5 minutes. Each girl is 'out' at the first spurt, so once you start 
      there's no point in stopping. Oh yes, all the girls stand on the tables 
      with their skirts hitched up and their knickers on view so that everyone 
      can see everything that happens."
      <br>
      <br>"But what about the start? How do we get a 
      fair contest?" asked Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"Sorry, I forgot," said Josef "all the 
      contestants start empty. Anyone who has entered before goes to the loo 10 
      minutes before the start. Everyone else goes at 5 minutes before. All the 
      contestants have to be standing on the tables 2 minutes before the start. 
      Oh and if any girl wants to, they can pull their knickers aside and 'go' 
      in the bar in front of everyone. This gives them about 8 minutes advantage 
      over the other 'experts' and 3 over the newcomers. -But they also run the 
      risk of losing by getting wet knickers even before the contest starts."
      <br>
      <br>"We'd better get practising then." said 
      Janet as she downed her bottle of water. 
      <br>
      <br>"You're on" said Sarah following suite. 
      "Can we have some more water please"
      <br>
      <br>"Of course" said Josef, "I'll go and get 
      some. Your time starts now, I'll bring a couple of litre bottles in a 
      quarter of an hour." 
      <br>
      <br>"I though that it was half litres after 
      the first." protested Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"It is." replied Josef, "But if you 
      practise with litres, it will be easier on the night!" he explained with a 
      wink.
      <br>
      <br>"What a brilliant idea" agreed Sarah, 
      "Thanks for that." 
      <br>
      <br>"That's all right." said Josef "I like 
      watching girls wet themselves."
      <br>
      <br>"If you want to drink anything else 
      instead of water, just let me know," he added as he returned to the bar.
      <br>
      <br>Fifteen minutes later Josef brought 
      another couple of bottles of water which the girls quickly downed. The 
      same thing happened in another quarter of an hour.
      <br>
      <br>"I don't know how well we'll do in the bar 
      on Wednesday, I'm already about to piss myself." exclaimed Sarah as they 
      downed the water.
      <br>
      <br>"Me too." agreed Janet "In fact I enjoyed 
      it so much when I wet myself earlier that I'm not going to hold it any 
      longer." and with that she just let go.
      <br>
      <br>"OK" agreed Sarah "But tomorrow we start 
      practising" she continued as she let go as well.
      <br>
      <br>They wet themselves again after each of 
      the next two bottles and then it was time to change for dinner. Just as 
      they were about to get up, Josef appeared by their sides.
      <br>
      <br>"If you want to stay by the pool, I can 
      get you something to eat," he offered "and I've got these for you," he 
      continued. "They're all-in wristbands in case I'm not here when you want 
      anything."
      <br>
      <br>"That's very good of you. Thank you" said 
      Janet. "But what did we do to deserve it?"
      <br>
      <br>"You put on a good show this afternoon,," 
      replied Josef.
      <br>
      <br>"Thank you," said Janet. "In that case 
      we'll stay, but please just bring a starter, we're full up."
      <br>
      <br>Josef laughed and said "Shall I continue 
      with the water, or have you had enough for today?"
      <br>
      <br>"Just half-litres then please," said Sarah 
      "And perhaps stretch it to half hours."
      <br>
      <br>"Just wave when you're ready." said Josef 
      as he went off to get to get the menus.
      <br>
      <br>When Josef returned, they chose a light 
      snack each and went to sit at the bar, where they spent the rest of the 
      evening continuing to drink lots of water and wetting themselves. 
      <br>
      <br>Eventually Janet said "I'm about ready for 
      bed. How about you?"
      <br>
      <br>"Yes," agreed Sarah "It's been a long and 
      interesting day."
      <br>
      <br>"So what's it going to be like wetting the 
      bed?" asked Janet.
      <br>
      <br>"Why?" said Sarah, "Does that mean that 
      you're going to?"
      <br>
      <br>"I expect so" replied Janet "after 
      drinking all this water. But I will check that the maid has put the 
      protection on -otherwise I'll have to get out of bed."
      <br>
      <br>"I guess that you're right" admitted Sarah 
      "Another drink before we go just to make sure?"
      <br>
      <br>"Might as well" agreed Janet waving to 
      Josef. "Can we have some more water please?"
      <br>
      <br>"Of course" said Josef "I guess that it's 
      just as well that Maria has sorted your beds!"
      <br>
      <br>"Oh good" said Sarah "In that case make it 
      litres not halves please. We might as well do a good job if we're going to 
      do it at all."
      <br>
      <br>As soon as they had finished they rushed 
      up to their room and into bed -after a quick check of the beds just to 
      make sure.
      <br>
      <br>"Are we just going to pee now or wait 
      until we're more desperate?" asked Janet.
      <br>
      <br>"We've been holding all day and I want to 
      see what it feels like to wet the bed. I'm feeling tired and I don't want 
      to fall asleep and then wake up with a wet bed having missed all the 
      action," replied Sarah. "So if it's OK with you, I think that we should 
      start as soon as possible."
      <br>
      <br>"Fine by me," said Janet "Both together or 
      as we please?"
      <br>
      <br>"How about each when she's ready but with 
      a running commentary?" suggested Sarah.
      <br>
      <br>"Me first then," said Janet, "Otherwise 
      it'll be an accidental wetting and I want this one to be deliberate. So." 
      she continued, "I'm not desperate but I do really need to go. Any moment 
      now I'll relax a bit, yes I'm about to let go. Here it comes. Wow that 
      feels good, better than this afternoon -it feels much naughtier, bikinis 
      are meant to get wet but not beds."
      <br>
      <br>"I need to go now,"said Sarah butting in. 
      "Oops no, it's too late, my bed is now getting wet. I can feel the piss 
      creeping up my ass, it's hot and wet. OO you're right it does feel so 
      good, well good's not quite the right word, sexxy maybe or just like you 
      said, naughty."
      <br>
      <br>"What a day!" said Janet, "But I'm 
      knackered, see you in the morning. Goodnight."
      <br>
      <br>"Goodnight" replied Sarah "And no waking 
      me up in the night by getting out for a pee."
      <br>
      <br>In the morning they couldn't remember how 
      many times they woke up needing to pee, but of course neither left their 
      beds.
