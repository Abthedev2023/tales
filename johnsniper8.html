    Youth #1&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Janis McKewan</strong></font><b><i></i></b><font
    FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I used
    to sit next to this adorable redhead in the 7th grade during 5th period English class and
    really liked her right from the first day of school. She was funny, intelligent and very
    friendly. She always wore a tight pair of long pants (our school's winter uniform), which
    really showed off her sexy curves. I had been trying to impress her since the first day in
    hopes of dating her, but without luck. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">So I jumped at the chance to carry her
    books to class, when I spotted her sprinting towards the girls toilets one day with all of
    her books in her hand, as I walked passed the staircase towards our class. She gratefully
    accepted and gave me a warm smile that melted my heart instantly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There was a long line of anxious girls
    waiting to go as well, so I walked on across the courtyard to the classroom and put her
    books down on her desk next to me at the back of the class and then sat down to get ready
    for the lesson. After a minute or two, the bell rang for class and the teacher (Mrs.
    Charleston or Corbis?), seeing that there were </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">still several girls missing, went out the
    door and headed over to the girls' toilets. A few moments later, a couple girls came into
    the class and quickly sat down with flushed looks on their faces. Two more girls followed
    them, and then Janis, who was blushing profusely, as she walked in with her blazer held in
    front of her. She quickly made her way </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">to her desk and sat down, as perspiration
    beaded her on her forehead. She seemed reluctant to hang her blazer over the back of her
    chair and then after a long pause whispered, &quot;Promise me you won't laugh.
    Please...&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I promise. Why?&quot; I replied
    sincerely, but she hesitated. &quot;I mean it. I wouldn't do that to you...&quot; She
    blushed and then slowly lifted her blazer away, revealing a dark wet spot in her crotch.
    For a moment, I was mesmerized by the shiny wetness and by the thought of this gorgeous
    mature girl having lost control if only for a second. I then took her blazer and hung it
    over the back of her chair, noticing in the process that there was a 2cm wet spot at the
    bottom curve of her bum at the back. I realized with a start that she had lost quite a bit
    of control and had had what my sister called a &quot;gullywasher&quot; (a sudden short
    spurt that rushes across the underside of a girl's bum). It was still diffusing slowly
    into the material of her pants and quite obvious to anyone that was looking, but luckily
    we were at the back and therefore out of view. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Are you okay?&quot; I asked
    sympathetically, having had to hold it in regularly. She nodded embarrassed and said,
    &quot;The toilets at this school are ridiculous and always full of people. I have been
    waiting since recess this morning and was just about to go into the stall when she came
    in...&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;You mean you still have to go?&quot;
    I said incredulous, as I know that when I have to go then, I have to go now or else...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She nodded, &quot;But its okay, I should be
    able to wait until the end of class, as I am used to waiting in the morning to get into
    the bathroom.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Large family?&quot; I asked, somewhat
    curious. &quot;No, just six, but all girls, except for my Dad,&quot; she replied. &quot;A
    medium family,&quot; I said, angling my head to one side. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">At that moment, the teacher returned with
    the last of the girls and waited for the girl to take her seat before handing out our quiz
    papers, as we usually did once a week.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">As to be expected, the teacher had set up a
    really hard quiz paper, which was going to make us work hard. (I don't remember what the
    quiz was on, but it was probably on our prescribed literature or some of the numerous
    poems that we had studied that week). In any case, it was five pages long and would take
    the whole class period to complete.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Janis got stuck into the quiz and seemed to
    be in control of things, even though I could see that her navel was a bit swollen. She did
    however shift in her seat every once in a while and I spotted her looking up at the clock
    a couple of times. After about fifteen minutes, she began to wiggle her right knee around
    and occasionally lean forward, as she finished answering the first page. She began to get
    more anxious, as time went on, undoubtedly because of the pressure building up in her
    bladder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">After a minute, I took the chance to glance
    at her through the corner of my eye, once I had finished the first page and was turning to
    the second. She had slipped forward in her chair, which gave me a good view of her crotch
    and I noticed that the wet spot had dried enough to be almost invisible. If she could just
    hold out until the end of the class </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">period, then she could race to the nearby
    toilet and relieve herself without any trace of her &quot;little&quot; accident. I was
    really praying that she would be able to wait, as I didn't want her to have to face the
    humiliation of having to wet her pants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">However, over the next ten minutes, she
    began to sit up stiffly in her chair and I noticed that her right knee was wiggling a lot
    faster. She was also sucking in her breath harshly every now and then, as her fidgeting
    increased. What surprised me most was just how much her navel or belly had swollen in the
    last ten minutes, as it had grown to the size of an orange.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Five minutes later, Janis crossed that thin
    psychological barrier, as she looked at the clock and then started chewing her bottom lip,
    as she leaned forward lifting her bum off of her seat. She was clearly getting desperate
    and I was beginning to wonder how long she would be able to wait, which was probably
    exactly what she was thinking too. Over the following half a minute, the battle inside her
    raged back and forth, until suddenly I saw her left hand rise slowly from on top of her
    desk. She began jiggling frantically, as she waited for the teacher to see her hand and
    walk over. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Please can I go to the toilet,
    Mrs.?&quot; she whispered anxiously, still openly wiggling and jiggling. &quot;No, you'll
    have to wait until the end of the period.&quot; &quot;Ooh, please Mrs., &quot; Janis
    whined in panic, &quot;I really have to go urgently...&quot; &quot;No. You'll just have to
    hold it in.&quot; &quot;Can't you make an exception, please.&quot; she begged, &quot;I'm
    bursting at the seams.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;You can just learn to pinch it off
    and wait like the other girls.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Janis hesitated for an agonizing moment and
    then blurted out, &quot;But, I can't wait anymore...&quot; &quot;Then you will just have
    to let it go. Won't you?&quot; the teacher replied, as the students in front of us
    sniggered. Janis watched in horror, as the teacher walked back up to the front of the
    classroom and then Janis dropped her hand into her lap, giving herself a quick squeeze.
    &quot;God, I really need to go to the toilet...'' Janis whined leaning forward and lifting
    her butt off of her seat to emphasize the fact.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Are you still going to be able to
    wait until the end of class?&quot; I asked worried.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A worried look came over her face, as she
    replied, &quot;I don't know. I thought that I would be able to after having relieved some
    of the pressure before this class, but I think that coke from recess has caught up with
    me.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;You have to hold it in,&quot; I said
    seriously, &quot;Or everyone will laugh at you.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;At least the wet spot has dried, but
    I don't know whether it will stay that way until the end of class,&quot; she replied
    fearfully.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">''There is only fourteen minutes left in
    this period.&quot; I replied looking at the clock.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A couple of tears erupted from her eyes, as
    she also looked at the clock and whimpered, &quot;Oh God... That's almost a whole quarter
    of an hour!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Try to think of something else,&quot;
    I offered, as the teacher gave us a dark look.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I'll try, but it's not easy, as it's
    starting to hurt a lot.&quot; Janis replied in a whisper, as the teacher cleared her
    throat in warning. &quot;You have to try and hold it in until the end of class.&quot; I
    said earnestly, as visions of the other students laughing echoed from my memory of
    personal humiliations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She nodded, but she wasn't half as
    confident as before, because the same visions must have been crossing her mind. She tried
    concentrating all her attention on her test and had to hold her paper still with her free
    hand while she wrote her answers in, her knuckles turning white under the force of her
    grip. Her legs were slapping together hard and I could see that her bladder had swollen to
    the size of a small party balloon. She must have had at least a liter in her bladder at
    that time, as I could see how badly it was distended and it was sore enough that Janis
    actually loosened the top button to relieve some of the pain and pressure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Over the next four minutes, I watched out
    of the corner of my eye, as her bladder took advantage of the lack of restraint and
    expanded even further. Swelling up roughly to the size of a volleyball and pushing open
    her zip, until I could see the dark red discoloration of her abdomen rising up from the
    hem of her white panties. She was in intense agony and couldn't sit still for a second, as
    she fretted and perspired heavily. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Suddenly, she squealed and doubled over, as
    a dark glistening wet patch erupted in her crotch around her zipper, where it was still
    closed. As she doubled over, a small spurt of piss shot through the material of her pants
    and landed on the front edge of her chair, as a layer of wetness emerged through the
    crotch of her pants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Immediately, she brought her knees up,
    jamming her hand into her groin, as she crossed her legs and wedged her feet behind the
    metal crossbar beneath the seat. She was whimpering all the time and brought her other
    hand down to help force her bladder into submission, as a wave of wetness spread up over
    her groin towards her bellybutton. I felt my crotch become hot and sticky, as my dick
    spasmed painfully and I then felt my crotch grow damp as my sodden underpants let the
    wetness through.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A shallow pool of pee collected in her lap,
    as I watched her panties go transparent where they were visible through her open zipper,
    revealing the tufts of hair that covered the upper end of her groin. The pool continued to
    expand slowly until it reached the sides of her hips and then began overflowing down the
    sides. Her mouth contorted into a snarl, as pee began dripping from her fingers where they
    stuck out between her tightly clenched thighs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I watched as another glistening wet spot
    started growing on the underside of her bum from where her thighs joined and headed
    backwards towards the crack of her butt. Janis gasped two or three times and then sighed
    heavily, as it began forming a puddle on her chair. Her body then relaxed, as a wave of
    wetness shot up and across the back of her butt to the waist and then soaking her white
    blouse where it clung to the small of her back, because she was sitting with her knees up
    high.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Her pants were absolutely drenched and
    dripping on the seat beneath her, expanding the dark yellow puddle already there. The
    other students burst out laughing at her when they spotted the pee dripping on to the
    floor beneath her chair. Janis started sobbing, as she realized just what a mess she had
    made of herself, as a ruby red blush covered her face. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The teacher came over and shook her head,
    saying, &quot;Young lady... Pull up that zipper! I will not have indecency in this
    class!&quot; The teacher then looked down at Janis and said, &quot;I hope it teaches you a
    lesson and that you will learn to go earlier to the toilets before class next time.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I am sorry...&quot; Janis whimpered
    mortified with humiliation. &quot;You've made your point, Mrs.,&quot; I stated, genuinely
    concerned for her. At that time I had no idea of what watersports was all about and also
    had a lot of sympathy for other people's needing to relieve themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The teacher relented and walked back to the
    front of the room, but the damage was done because the whole class now knew of her
    predicament. Even worse was the fact that she was sitting in a puddle of her own pee,
    which prevented her pants from drying out. Her pants were completely soaking wet and had
    no place to dissipate but down along the backs of her thighs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There was now only eight minutes left in
    the class period and I knew that she was going to have to walk out passed all the other
    students with peed pants, which would make her the laughing-stock of the school for weeks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I hurriedly got back to my test, but kept
    an eye on her while I worked. When there was only five minutes left, I noticed that she
    was wiggling her legs again and realized that she hadn't let all of her pee out, as her
    bladder looked still half the size that it had been. That amazed me, because she had at
    least 3/4 of a liter of pee puddled on the seat of her chair and on the floor, plus
    another 3/4 or so soaked up into her pants. That was about a liter and a half that she had
    peed in roughly just under two or three minutes and her bladder was still swollen.
    &quot;Do you still need to go?&quot; I whispered incredulous.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She turned scarlet and nodded demurely,
    &quot;I haven't been to the toilet since I left home this morning, but I only felt the
    need to go at recess.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;You must have a cast iron
    bladder!&quot; I mused astounded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;A large glass of orange juice with my
    bowl of cereal, half full of milk - A cup of coffee before I left home and a half liter of
    coke at recess,&quot; Janis supplied truthfully.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;God, I would have exploded and
    totally flooded out this classroom if I had drunk that much,&quot; I stated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Apparently, that's what I did to my
    chair,&quot; she replied dejected and feeling sorry for herself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">We then went back to writing our tests, but
    I could see that Janis was desperate again as the wall clock showed that there was only
    two minutes left. When the bell finally sounded, the other students hurried out except for
    a couple of the girls, who waited until last and then left with their blazers tied around
    their waists, concealing saucer sized wet spots in their groins. 'It seems that you
    weren't the only one wetting her pants.&quot; I announced as the teacher started walking
    over to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I wish I was one of them,&quot; Janis
    moaned and then turned to ask the teacher, &quot;Please can you phone the nurse and tell
    her to phone my Dad to fetch me?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Sorry, but you're going to have to go
    phone your Dad yourself from the nurses office,&quot; the teacher replied, &quot;the PA
    system is out of order. Right now, I need you out of this class so that I can go find the
    janitor,&quot; she stated, &quot;come on, up you get and get moving.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Janis stood up and I watched, as pee ran
    down the back of her legs from her dripping wet, soaked butt. She then burst into tears,
    as she pleaded with wiggling legs, &quot;Please, Mrs.! I can't walk out of the classroom
    like this... All of the other students will laugh at me.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">But the teacher was not interested at all
    or sympathetic, so I said, </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I will help you get out of here and
    you can borrow my blazer to cover yourself.&quot; &quot;Thanks,&quot; Janis said, beaming
    me a smile.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">We then left the classroom with our books
    and walked away towards the girls' toilet across the courtyard, only to find a long line
    of bouncing girls prancing around outside the door. Janis went deathly pale and squeezed
    her crotch with her free hand. Almost immediately, she let out a short spurt of piss that
    flooded her groin and looked at me absolutely terrified.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I quickly grabbed her by the elbow and led
    her up the steps away from the toilets. By the time I got her to the service alley for
    plumbers, etc, she was spurting into her pants again, drenching the front of her pants
    down to her knees and whimpering pathetically. I quickly held my blazer in a way that she
    could hide behind and her desperation took over, as she frantically began ripping open her
    fly and belt with both </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">hands. By the time she got her pants
    halfway down, she was peeing full force into her transparent white panties and squealing,
    as it ran down the inside of her legs. She just managed to hook her panties and yank them
    down, squatting at the same time, before her torrent of piss exploded into a high-powered
    jet that drummed into the ground between her feet. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">By this time, I had turned my back towards
    her, but I could still see her hairy streaming pussy framed between my thighs, as she
    continued to pee uncontrollably for another two minutes. When her pee finally slowed and
    then stopped, I thought she was finished, but she pushed out a couple more spurts before
    she wiped herself and started pulling up her pants and panties. She then stepped away
    revealing a massive pee puddle that had run halfway down to the gate, 3 meters (10 feet)
    away.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;What am I going to do about all this
    pee in my pants?&quot; she cried, pulling her pants up between her girly thighs.
    &quot;Come with me,&quot; I said, as a plan occurred to me. I then lead her to the
    fishpond inside the south gate entrance and helped her to rinse out her pants with the
    pond water. When she was finished, she leant towards me and gave me a kiss on the lips
    that I still remember 18 years later. She then thanked me, with a very relieved look on
    her face, and walked away towards the admin block to call her Dad.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was the start of a four-year
    relationship that got me laid before any other boy in my grade, but that is another
    chapter in her story...</font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></p>
