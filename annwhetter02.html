    <br>
    Mary was in a bit of a quandary. She wanted to stay overnight with her friend Sue after
    their 19th birthday celebrations in a couple of weeks time. But after going out to the
    clubs, where she was sure to have a drink or two, she was afraid that she would wet the
    bed. It wasn't that she did it every night, she didn't, it was only ever at weekends
    except it was always after she'd been out drinking. Which of course was the problem, she
    was concerned that she would forget where she was when she woke up needing to pee and wet
    the bed at Sue's house.<br>
    <br>
    She still hadn't made up her mind to risk it, or to say she couldn't go, when she heard
    her mother arriving home after a shopping trip to town. Mary went into the hall to meet
    her and as her mother turned to hang up her coat, Mary noticed a dark patch on the back of
    her skirt. &quot;Are you all right, Mum?&quot; Mary asked in puzzlement, &quot;only it
    looks as if you've, er, wet yourself.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm fine.&quot; she replied &quot;I&#146;ve never felt better in fact, and yes I
    have. Come into the kitchen, we'll make a pot of tea and I'll tell you all about it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    As soon as they were sitting at the kitchen table with large mugs of tea, Mary's Mum said
    &quot;I've got some very good news for you. You can go to Sue's and no need to worry about
    the bed or what Sue and her mum will think as they both wet their beds, so the bed will be
    protected.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thanks Mum.&quot; said Mary gratefully &quot;but how do you know?&quot; she added.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I was looking round the shops wondering how we could solve your 'problem' when I
    passed Mothercare. It then occurred to me that perhaps nappies might just be the answer. I
    was standing by the shelves looking for the largest ones when I noticed another lady doing
    the same.<br>
    <br>
    We got around to talking and discovered that we both had daughters who were soon to
    celebrate their 19th birthdays with a sleepover. Both girls wet their beds and were
    worried about their friend finding out. It suddenly occurred to me that this was too much
    of a coincidence for her not to be Sue's mum, so I asked her. 'And you must be Mary's
    mum,' she agreed.<br>
    <br>
    'Well that's going to save us some money.' she said putting the packet of nappies back on
    the shelf. 'How about a coffee?'<br>
    <br>
    Over coffee we were chatting when Alison (Sue's mother) suddenly said 'I've just had a
    thought. If I put Mary in the spare bed in Sue's room and one of them wets the bed and the
    other doesn't then they'll both be embarrassed. Mind you they'll both know so they could
    make a pact. No, I know, they can both sleep in my bed, then when one wets the bed the
    other will know and can do the same.'<br>
    <br>
    'But what about your mattress' I asked. 'Oh that's no problem' she said, 'all the beds in
    our house are protected with waterproof covers on the mattresses and towels under the
    bottom sheets ready for the inevitable.'<br>
    <br>
    'What- your bed as well?' I asked. 'Oh yes.' she said, 'it&#146;s not unknown for me to
    have the occasional 'accident'. In fact it's very likely that there'll be more than one
    set of wet sheets that weekend.'<br>
    <br>
    By this time coffee had turned into a bottle of wine or two and we were getting quite
    giggly.<br>
    <br>
    'I don't half need to pee' I told Alison.<br>
    <br>
    'Me too' she said 'So, do we find the Ladies&#146;, or not?'<br>
    <br>
    'What do you mean?' I asked her.<br>
    <br>
    'Well we can either go to the Ladies&#146;, or.... not bother.'<br>
    <br>
    'I'm still not with you' I told her.<br>
    <br>
    'I'm about to wet myself'<br>
    <br>
    'What here?' I asked<o:p><br>
    <br>
    'Yes. In fact I'm doing it now.' And with that she knocked a bottle of water over. 'Now
    no-one will know.'<br>
    <br>
    I looked down and saw the two puddles merging under the table. At this I started laughing,
    which was a mistake because I then started to spurt in my knickers. She realised what was
    happening and said 'Wasn't there a lot of water in that bottle?' This set me off laughing
    again and this time I couldn't stop wetting myself -and soon realised that I didn't want
    to.<br>
    <br>
    'My goodness' I said, 'I don't half feel naughty.'<br>
    <br>
    'Was that your first time?' she asked puzzled, 'Only I thought that with you being Mary's
    mum, you'd be into this sort of thing.'<br>
    <br>
    'Why? Does it run in families then?' I asked and then remembered the weekend that you went
    to stay with my young sister Jenny and your cousin Janet. You came back with a parcel and
    a note which said that they had introduced you to the family 'game' and to put the
    contents of the parcel on your bed before it was too late.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I remember&quot; said Mary &quot;and I managed to wait until the following weekend
    before putting it to the test.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;True&quot; replied her mother, &quot;But there have been wet knickers in the washing
    basket most nights ever since.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes&quot; said Mary, &quot;but do you know what happened that WEEkend?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No&quot; her mother answered, &quot;Do tell.&quot;<br>
