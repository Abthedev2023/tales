    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I was in college I lived in the
    dorms on campus.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just couldn't afford not
    to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You see, I grew up farming and ranching
    and I am very good with my hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
    sophomore year at college, the Dorm system I lived in consisted of three buildings that
    needed a new maintenance man as the last one had graduated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The dorms and the college in general tried to give as many jobs as they
    could to the students to give them extra money.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
    course if there were any major construction or re-construction going on, the physical
    plant personnel would come fix the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    for basic closet door repair, painting and the like, I was able to handle.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In return I got my room and board for free as a
    member of staff, which was better than being a Resident Advisor. They had to stay on-site
    once every 7 days for a full 24-hour shift.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Me,
    I was free to come and go as I pleased and didn't have to pull desk duty.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The dorms where I lived had three
    buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon Hall 1, 2 &amp; 3.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon Hall 1 was the oldest of the three
    buildings and as such had communal bathrooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1st
    and 2nd floors were female floors and 3rd and 4th floors were male.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon 2 and 3 were both made up of suites with
    a bathroom between each two rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon 2
    was co-ed and Brandon 3 was all female.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
    workshop was in Brandon 1 on first floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(It
    was a tough job, but someone had to do it.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandon
    1 tended to be mostly freshman as there were communal bathrooms and no air-conditioning.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a member of staff, I got a room to myself in
    Brandon 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At the first of the year, Elizabeth,
    a junior and the R.A. (resident assistant) for Brandon 1 first floor had me come to their
    first all floor meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At these meetings
    the R.A. for each floor meets the new people and lets them in on the rules.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the rules was that the doors for 1st and
    2nd floor were locked at 10:00 PM and no males were allowed unescorted on the floor after
    that time and no males on the floor at all after 11:30 PM.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>That way the girls could be an early warning device for each other, as they
    tended to walk around in little or nothing after 10:00 PM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Elizabeth had me come to the meeting
    to explain to everyone who I was and why I might be seen at any hour on his or her floor,
    because my workshop was next to their communal bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I explained to them that I would only be on the floor unescorted after 10:00
    PM if there was some sort of emergency I had to take care of and that I would announce my
    presence before I came on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Being
    the maintenance man, I had keys to all the floors like any other member of staff.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Elizabeth told the girls, that I had
    given them fair warning and to be prepared when leaving their rooms after 10:00 PM.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With 20-year-old buildings, there
    were lots of things that needed fixing and the girls on 1st floor got very used to my
    being there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After a couple of weeks bras
    and panties were something that they all felt comfortable about running around in when I
    was there and 3 or 4 girls were comfortable in less than that. (Like I said, it was a
    tough job, but somebody had to do it!)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    quickly got to be where I was like one of the members of the floor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Annie must have always had a bladder
    problem, because the first time I ever saw her she was running out of a room in panties
    holding a T-shirt she hadn't even put on yet, hollering back into the room that she would
    be right back, but she just had to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Annie
    was a cute little 18 year old about 5'2&quot; tall with a slender waist and a pretty face.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she left the room and headed for the bathroom,
    she saw me, with her two big beautiful, firm, Double-D tits bouncing. She stopped and
    quickly put her shirt on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, red-faced she
    ran by me to the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That girl could piss like a cow on a
    flat rock, because everyone could hear her down the hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>A couple of girls started laughing and when she came out they began to tease
    her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was working on the lock for one of the
    girls' room and she was still red faced as she walked by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Being a joker I just had to make a
    comment and I told her not to worry about it, all girls had tits, and the only way she
    would really get my attention was if she had three of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She laughed, and told me she only had two but that she was not used to
    showing them off to just any guy she happened to run by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I thanked her for the show and she thanked me for being impressed and went
    back to the room she that she had come from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One October morning I got a call
    from Elizabeth about 5:00 am and she advised me that the showers in their bathroom were
    not working right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I went to the floor,
    hollered to let everyone know I was there and went to the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There I hollered inside to see if anyone was
    there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jennifer hollered that she would be
    right out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A couple minutes later she came
    out and told me no one else was in there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    went in to look at the showers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
    outside back of the shower wall was the access panel for the shower plumbing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was right across from the stalls.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I took off the panel and could immediately see
    what the problem was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>An old automatic valve
    was stuck and I needed to change it quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
    a big problem, about a 10-minute job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I went
    next door to my shop; got a new valve and the tools I needed and went to work.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About 5 minutes into the job the
    door bursts open and in comes Annie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told
    her I would be done in a few minutes and she said ok, she would wait and left.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A couple minutes later she sticks her head in the
    door and asks if I'm about done cause she has got to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I told her not quite, and she looked around, realizing that no one else was
    up and about, and then came in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    apologized and said that she just had to pee cause she just got up and went into the last
    stall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I was working on the valve, I could
    hear the pee splashing against the porcelain of the bowl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She was trying as hard as she could to be quiet this time.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she finished she came out,
    red-faced again and went to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before she
    did she stopped and told me that in the few short weeks that she had been there I had
    managed to embarrass her more than any other man she ever knew.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her that I was glad to be of service, and
    we both just laughed and she left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of weeks later I learned
    first hand how bad her bladder control was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
    couple of blocks away, within walking distance was a local bar.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ok, it was within stumbling distance, which is
    really important in college.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Anyway, a bunch of us from the dorm
    were over there drinking and having a good time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Annie
    happened to be in the group and she seemed to have to pee after each beer she drank.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the evening wore on the place got packed and
    there began to form a line for the women's bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>We were within view of the bathroom doors and a couple of times when Annie
    had to wait, she would dance in place a little before getting inside.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Around 11:00 or so, I needed to pee.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By now there was a small line 2 or 3 guys for the
    men's room and a pretty good line, 6 or 7 girls for the ladies room.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got up, got in line, and waited my turn. I was
    not desperate, but my bladder was quite full.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
    few seconds after I got in line, Annie shows up and gets in the girls' line.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Within a couple of minutes she is bouncing a
    little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time only two girls have gone
    in and come out, she is doing a full-blown pee-pee dance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She looked at me and said, &quot;God I wish they would hurry up, I have got
    to piss.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her bouncing became more
    frantic as she waited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By this time I was
    next in line for the men's room.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As I
    entered Annie hobbled in behind me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    looked at me helplessly and asked me to let her use the bathroom, as she was about to piss
    her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now I had to pee, but I was still in
    a condition to wait.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I wasn't telling
    Annie this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just looked at her and told her
    fine, but I had to pee too and I was not leaving. There was only a toilet and a urinal in
    this little bathroom and no divider or wall between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I stepped up to the urinal to take care of my aching bladder and began to
    pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sound of my piss hitting the urinal
    was just too much for Annie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She quickly
    stripped her jeans and panties down and sat on the toilet next to me not two feet away.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was peeing before she even sat down.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face was redder than I had ever seen it before
    as she peed and peed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I finished up and was
    washing my hands and she was still peeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    waited for her to finish so I could open the door to leave. When she finally finished we
    both left and went back to the table we were all sitting at.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of the people were off on the dance floor or
    playing pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As we sat there she looked at
    me and apologized for what had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    began to tell me that ever since she was a little girl that when the urge to pee came on
    her, she had to pee right then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If she waited
    just a few minutes she would run the risk of wetting herself and that had happened so many
    times in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went on to tell me
    that she had been to the doctor about the problem but that none of them had been able to
    help her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems that her bladder would
    wait till it was full before sending any signals to the brain telling her to empty it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that she would feel just fine one minute
    and the next she would be dying for a pee. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I finished my beer and decided to go
    back to the dorm as I had early plans for the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Annie asked if she could walk with me, as she was ready to leave.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her sure and we headed off on the 5-block
    walk to home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About three blocks from the bar
    Annie suddenly took in a sharp breath and I heard her mutter &quot;not now.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her if everything was all right and she
    just looked at me and told me that after tonight there weren't a lot of secrets left
    between us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she told me she had to pee
    again and it was bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked her if she
    thought she could make it back to the dorm and she told me she didn't think so and asked
    me what she was going to do. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We were next to some bushes on a
    side street and I told her that she could pee here in the bushes, or try to make it home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She had her hand in her crotch and was
    wiggling already and she told me there was no way she could make it home but that she had
    never peed in the bushes before and she wasn't sure she could pee with me there.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I offered to leave but she quickly asked me not
    too, she was afraid of being there alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I told her I didn't see why she was
    being so shy now when she peed in front of me in the bathroom at the bar and she stated
    that that had been different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was able to
    keep her legs closed then and that I couldn't really see anything.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About that time she doubled over and went into a
    half squat with both hands in her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Shit,
    I just got to pee...NOW!&quot; she said and hobbled over to the bushes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she was pulling her pants down she asked me to
    keep watch so no one came along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fat chance of that, even though she
    had dropped her pants in front of me earlier, I wasn't missing this show.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she started to squat down a jet of pee burst
    from her hairy little pussy, partially soaking her panties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She swore at that and continued to pee for all she was worth.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she finally finished she stood up and
    surveyed the damage realizing that though her jeans had miraculously been spared her
    panties were soaked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quickly she slipped off
