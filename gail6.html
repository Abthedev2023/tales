    Late Check-Out<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </strong>This is actually a true story. The Hyatt San Francisco will never be the same
    again.<br>
    <br>
    Lisa stirred slightly, sensing more than feeling movement on the other side of the bed.
    The mattress momentarily tilted as her companion swung her legs around and sat up. Briefly
    opening one eye she saw 5:47 in bright red digits on the hotel alarm clock. Closing her
    eye she settled back down for another hour of sleep.</font><strong></strong><p><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Drifting back into her slumber Lisa heard Sandi
    walking towards the bathroom. Sandi opened the door, lifted up the creaky toilet seat and
    after a few seconds Lisa recognized the familiar sounds of a full-blooded bladder-bursting
    morning pee splashing violently into the pan. Her last thoughts as consciousness faded
    away acknowledged that her bladder was pretty full too.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The radio alarm roused Lisa from a deep
    sleep at 7:15. Sitting up, rubbing her eyes, she saw Sandi, dressed in t-shirt and panties
    wave at her as she entered the bathroom. Lisa chuckled, thinking if only the folks in the
    office could see us now. There was nothing romantic going on, as the hi-tech company which
    employed both of them was cutting costs by sharing rooms at conferences. They'd been
    friends for years, so that wasn't a problem, but their flight had been delayed the night
    before. By the time they checked in there were only rooms with a single king bed
    available. At 1am, after tanking down free drinks on the plane, they just giggled and
    checked on in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Lisa definitely had to pee. No question
    about it. She sat in bed for a minute waiting for Sandi to finish. Boy, did she have to
    go. Her normally flat stomach actually had a small bump in it from her swollen bladder.
    Waking up had kick started her kidneys into action and she felt herself filling even
    further. She decided to go bang on the door and tell Sandi to get her ass in gear. Just
    standing up allowed gravity to take its toll, and she felt the pressure on her peehole
    muscles double. This wasn't good. She gasped and involuntarily clenched her muscles,
    pushing one hand against herself through her panties.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A few steps from the door she heard the
    shower start and a curtain swish as Sandi obviously had climbed into the tub. The sound of
    running water was almost too much for her. She nearly lost it then and there, frantically
    crossing her legs and shoving both hands between her legs. Geez, I must look like a
    four-year-old in preschool right now, she thought.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Lisa thought through her options. The
    nearest bathroom was in the hotel lobby. That was twenty-one floors down and she'd have to
    throw on some clothes and get there through a mass of conventioneers. Surely Sandi would
    be out in a minute. Lisa was a big girl and could wait five minutes, she told herself. The
    only thing in the room she could use was the ice bucket, and that was ... wrong, crude ..
    she couldn't do that.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">While she was standing there thinking it
    all through, she'd placed her right hand inside her panties. It was pressing hard against
    her, and the middle finger had slipped between her lips and was directly rubbing her
    aching peehole. She felt her muscles twitch and then spasm, but no wetness emerged. She
    increased the pressure even further and rubbed even faster, shifting her weight from one
    foot to the other. She decided to bang on the door.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Sandi, Sandi ... hurry up! I'm going
    to explode&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She heard the water stop and the shower
    curtain swish back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;What ?&quot; Sandi asked .</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Sandi, I've gotta pee - hurry up and
    let me in - it hurts so bad.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;OK - I'll be out in three minutes.
    Promise.&quot; Sandi answered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Lisa felt another spasm course through her
    and noted that her pussy lips were getting wet, kind of sticky wet though. She knew she
    hadn't yet leaked. She suddenly realized that all her rubbing was speedily bringing her
    close to orgasm. If she stopped rubbing she knew she'd end up in a puddle within seconds.
    May as well carry on, maybe she'd hold out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Bracing herself against the wall with her
    left hand, still rubbing with her right, she shuddered again - unable to tell what was
    happening with her body. Seconds later she experienced an unbelievable pressure in her
    groin and recognized the onset of the first contraction of what was going to be a long and
    deep climax. As wave after wave of pleasure hit her she knew her muscles were contracting
    and expanding, sending huge jets of hot, yellow morning pee into her panties. The first
    spurt totally soaked them, the second went almost straight through them. The liquid
    coursed down the inside and back of her legs, around her feet and actually started to flow
    under the bathroom door. Lisa felt the wetness gush up between her butt cheeks as it
    forced itself into every nook and cranny. For some reason she pulled her soaked panties
    down about six inches onto her thighs and watched as yet another jet sprayed out from her
    swollen lips and cascaded onto the tiles in front of her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Opening up her eyes after she'd emptied
    herself in every possible way, Lisa saw that the bathroom door was now open. Sandi stood
    there, soaking wet, with her arms crossed in front of her. The puddle was now about three
    feet wide on the tiled floor and Sandi was actually standing on the edge of it. Lisa had
    never seen her friend naked before, blushed, and then burst into laughter at the look on
    her friends face as she realized what was keeping her toes warm. Sandi started to laugh
    too, and the two of them hugged each other hysterically - surrounded by an ever-growing
    puddle of pee.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">If only the rest of the day could be this
    much fun, Lisa thought.</font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></p>
