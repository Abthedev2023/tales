    <br>
    Tyler gazed around at the sparkling surface of the water of the crowded swimming pool. So
    many people seemed to have the same idea as him. It was a hot summer day, near the end of
    July and all of Tyler's buds had deserted him for their summer jobs. Bored and full of
    pent-up desires (solitary masturbation just isn't enough), Tyler donned a hot pair of swim
    trunks under his clothes, and headed over to the local pool. He was keen on all those
    dripping, scantily clothed females. Oh, how he envied the male lifeguards that worked
    there.<br>
    <br>
    He scanned the edge of the pool, looking for a friendly face. Seeing no one he recognized,
    he then turned his focus to the vacant poolside lounge chairs. He finally spotted an empty
    chair, sauntered over, and flung his towel onto the seat. Glancing around, he kicked off
    his sandals, and then grimaced as his bare feet hit the hot cement. &quot;Whew.&quot; he
    muttered under his breath. A pretty girl lying in the chair beside him glanced up from the
    magazine she had been reading. She started to return to the fashion tips and horoscopes,
    but as Tyler began peeling off his t-shirt, revealing his tan, toned abs, he suddenly had
    her full attention. Tyler was aware of his audience and grinned as he wiggled out of his
    shorts. He wadded his clothes up and placed them next to his chair, then flopped down.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey,&quot; he said cheerfully to the girl next to him. As he waited for her reply,
    he briefly checked her out. She was pretty. Slender, nice body, toned. She had pretty eyes
    and a beautiful smile. His eyes rested on her small breasts, cutely bouncing in her skimpy
    bikini. Her soft hair gently touched her shoulders as she leaned forward. He licked his
    lips.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi,&quot; came the girl's reply. She smiled. &quot;I'm Sara.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm Tyler.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So, what brings you here?&quot; asked Sara, gazing around pointedly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ah... Just... Boredom, I guess.&quot; said Tyler. Sara pursed her lips thoughtfully.
    &quot;'The guys' all deserted me,&quot; Tyler remarked with a sigh. Then he laughed.
    &quot;Oh well... I'll probably have more fun without them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sara smiled her beautiful smile again. She started to ask, &quot;So are you from around
    here?&quot; when Tyler asked the same question. They laughed. Tyler concluded that he was
    indeed, from the neighborhood, and Sara admitted that she and her family had just moved to
    the area a couple of months ago. Being summer, they had waited until after the school term
    was over before moving, and that when school once again, she would be going to Oakland
    High as a senior.<br>
    <br>
    Upon hearing this, Tyler exclaimed, &quot;Hey... That's where I go. I'll be a senior this
    term also.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Really?&quot; asked Sara.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, just turned eighteen.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sara smiled like that was the best thing in the world. &quot;Me too.&quot; After they had
    talked for a while, Tyler offered to buy Sara a drink. She laughed and tried to refuse,
    but he sauntered over to the vending machines and came back with two cold sodas. They
    sipped their drinks, sunbathed, and shared a pleasant conversation.<br>
    <br>
    Tyler and Sara spent an hour or longer sitting side by side, just chatting away, about
    school, past relationships, music, and everything else, until the bright drove them into
    the water. Once they decided to descend into the cool water of the pool, Tyler gently
    lowered himself down the ladder, and then moved aside. After Sara climbed down the ladder,
    Tyler offered her a hand and pulled her out into the middle of the pool. They became
    involved in a simple game of splashing and goofed off while. When they both felt that they
    had been cooled off enough, they climbed back out of the pool and strode back over to
    their chairs. Tyler's imagination ran away with him at the sight of Sara emerging,
    dripping, from the water. As her cute little bottom sat back down on the lounge chair, she
    dabbed gently at he arms and legs with her towel.<br>
    <br>
    They started talking once more, then lie back to dry, and Tyler found himself sharing
    Sara's lounge chair. Sara was jokingly teasing Tyler, and as retaliation, he leaned over
    and started tickling her. &quot;Stop! Hahahaha! Oh, Tyler--Stop! Ah!&quot; she shrieked,
    laughing all the while. Tyler only tickled her more furiously. &quot;Ooh! Tyler! I've
    gotta pee!&quot; Suddenly, Tyler stopped tickling her. She had said the magic words. But
    Sara didn't look at all embarrassed. In fact, she was grinning. They were both at a loss
    for words for a few moments. Then, Sara sighed, &quot;Whew. I thought I was going to wet
    myself!&quot; She laughed and glanced at Tyler sidewise. He grinned mischievously.
    &quot;Oh no, you don't!&quot; Sara yelled playfully as he lunged at her to tickle her once
    more. Sara jumped up and jumped into the pool. Tyler was close behind and cannonball-ed in
    behind her. As they bobbed to the surface, they swam nearer to the shallow end and stood
    up. Sara shivered. Tyler wrapped an arm around her, huddled down into the water.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cold?&quot; he asked her quietly.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah, but I betcha I could warm the water up a bit,&quot; was her reply. Tyler was
    shocked. He waited for a spreading feeling of warmth, but nothing happened. Sara pulled
    him closer. She stood on her tiptoes and lightly kissed him. She moved his hands down to
    her stomach and he gently caressed her, feeling the bulge just above the top of her bikini
    bottoms. Suddenly, she pulled away and nimbly pulled herself over the side of the pool.
    She sat down on the tiled side and dangled her legs in the water. Tyler climbed up to sit
    next to her. They swung their feet back and forth in the cool water. Tyler had his arm
    around Sara and was very amused with the way she kept crossing and uncrossing her legs.
    She shoved a hand between her thighs. Tyler's throat suddenly went dry. He swallowed
    loudly and Sara leaned up to kiss him again. She placed his hand on her crotch and
    released just a tiny little squirt. He felt the warmness under his hand.<br>
    <br>
    She was just about to completely let go when they were suddenly splashed. &quot;Sorry
    dude!&quot; yelled a guy splashing around in the water. &quot;Didn't mean to! Hey- Do ya
    wanna join us?&quot; He motioned at Tyler and Sara to join him and his friends in a game
    of &quot;Chicken.&quot; Both Tyler and Sara were familiar with the pool game where a girl
    climbs on top of a guy's shoulders in the water while the guys wrestle and the girls
    simultaneously try to push each other off into the water.<br>
    <br>
    Before Tyler could reply, Sara had slipped into the pool and was swimming toward the
    splashing group, dragging Tyler by his hand. Tyler took his place with the other guys and
    helped Sara climb onto his shoulders, vaguely wondering if she still had to pee. As she
    steadied her, she leaned from atop his shoulders and her sharp intake of breath confirmed
    that she did. As Tyler steadied her on his shoulders, she leaned down and whispered,
    &quot;I still have to pee, you know.&quot; Tyler was ecstatic. He could feel her womanhood
    pressing against the back of his neck as she sat perched on his shoulders. He was
    constantly aware of her condition, even as they wrestled and splashed. Suddenly, Sara
    shoved the other girl off her guy's shoulders. She stood up in the water, laughing and
    then tried to climb back onto his shoulders.<br>
    <br>
    The sudden movement of shoving the other girl had Sara to suddenly squirt hot pee into her
    swimsuit. She pressed her pee-hole against Tyler, but she had to keep her legs open to
    keep her balance on his shoulders. Tyler felt his neck suddenly grow warmer, and he began
    running his fingers up and down Sara's legs. Using one hand to hold her steady on his
    shoulders, he used the other to tickle her. She gasped and his neck felt even warmer. Sara
    was quickly losing control. Her muscles strained to contain the torrent, and even though
    her womanhood was pressed tight against Tyler, her legs were still spread apart, weakening
    her already exhausted muscles. Tyler tickled her even more furiously and Sara burst into
    fits of laughter. As she did so, the dam broke and jets of hot pee gushed and hissed out.
    It sprayed against her bikini bottoms, against Tyler's neck; it ran down her legs, and
    down Tyler's back. He quickly lowered her from his shoulders, spun her around in the
    water, and turned her so that she faced him. He pressed her closer to him and stroked her,
    all the while, the water was growing warmer and warmer around them. He pressed his hands
    to her crotch and felt the warmness gushing out. Finally, it dwindled down and she sighed
    and leaned against him... so relieved... and so horny. He lifted her up, out of the water,
    her soggy bathing suit dripping. They grabbed their belongings and made their way around
    the edge of the pool.<br>
    <br>
    They walked over to the bathroom area. Tyler strode over to a changing tent and
    tentatively pulled the curtain open. Seeing that it was empty, he led Sara inside. They
    tied the canvas door shut and stood in the warm shade of the small tent. Tyler turned to
    Sara, and gently untied the strings that tied her bikini top. It fell to the ground. Her
    round little breasts were shining with water from the pool, her wet hair dripping onto
    them. He reached over to her waist and wiggled her bikini bottoms off. Just the sight of
    her... Then, she yanked his trunks off. They stood, facing each other for only a moment.
    Sara then took a step backward, grasped one of the metal support poles inside the tent and
    braced herself, thrusting her pelvis at him. Sensing what she wanted, Tyler took a step
    forward. Suddenly, even more urine gushed out at him. He placed his hand in front of her,
    and then pressed himself to her. At she erratically peed, he entered her. They slid to the
    ground together, entwined, and..... Wet.<br>
