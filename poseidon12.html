     Going at
     
     the 
      Match<br>
    </strong>
    </font><br><br>This happened several years ago now when I was going out with 
      lad who was a real football fanatic. Fortunately I enjoy the game as well, 
      especially as most Saturday afternoons found us in the stands at our local 
      ground. Nothing exciting - only second division, and not just the team. 
      The facilities at the ground were limited and basic with few toilets for 
      either sex. Those that were provided were scruffy, dirty and best avoided 
      unless absolutely desperate.<br><br>Of course, having had a jar or two in the pub before the match, sitting 
      or standing in the cold were a simple recipe for desperation. Many times I 
      found that I had to push through the crowd at half-time and again before 
      we left, often queuing for a while in increasing discomfort. How I envied 
      the blokes - they simply peed into their empty beer bottles, something 
      accepted as OK, even with women nearby.<br><br>My only option would have been to squat down, pull my pants aside and 
      pee on the concrete terrace. My boyfriend actually suggested this, but 
      somehow I don't think this would have been accepted in the same way. Women 
      aren't expected to act like men and anyway, I really didn't like the idea 
      of exposing myself in this way so continued to endure the crush and filthy 
      toilets.<br><br>Then it happened. We were at a pre-season friendly with a major team 
      and as I didn't need to go too badly at half-time decided to hang on till 
      the end. With a few minutes of the match left I really did need the loo 
      badly but knew I could hold on. Then, with seconds before the final 
      whistle our team scored the winner. Everyone, including me, was out of their seats and leaping about with excitement. Now jumping 
      up and down with a full bladder is not sensible, and I promptly wet my 
      pants! I didn't lose control completely and managed to stop a flood but my 
      knickers and tights were soaked and I could feel it trickling down my 
      leg.<br><br>The whistle went, but there was no way I was going to be able to reach 
      the loo quickly. There I stood, wet knickers and still dying for a pee. I 
      quietly told my boyfriend of my plight, though not about the state of my 
      underwear. He was quite the the gentleman and helped forge a path through 
      the crowd only to find a long queue for the Ladies loo. I just stood 
      there, legs crossed, bobbing up and down wondering what I was going to do. 
      Then Jim suggested the pub, which was only 400 metres away. We moved away 
      from the crowd but my bursting bladder was making walking difficult.<br><br>I stopped and told Jim that there was no way I would make it and almost 
      had tears in my eyes as I admitted that I had already weed in my pants and 
      was in danger of making a puddle. His response surprise me totally. He 
      pulled me to him and told me to just go ahead, pointing to a van parked in 
      a quiet alley which would provide some screening. Well, it certainly 
      would'nt be the first time I had wet myself like this. There had been 
      several occasions when walking home from a drunken night out with the 
      girls we had all been caught short and rather than bare all had simply 
      squatted or stood in a doorway or alleyway and wet ourselves - it was the 
      obvious solution to the problem.<br><br>I quickly moved behind the van, spread my legs and let go. What sweet 
      relief. A torrent poured from me, a hot stream running one leg, a large 
      puddle forming round my feet. Jim, who had most politely turned his back 
      on me, looked round as I finished, passing me a handkerchief with which to 
      dry my legs. He admitted later that he had actually watched me in the door 
      mirror of the van!<br><br>We quickly walked back to the car and were back at my flat in 20 
      minutes. As I got out I realised that there was a large wet patch on the 
      seat where I had been sitting but Jim didn't seem to mind. I soon found 
      why. As soon as we were indoors he grabbed me to him, kissing me 
      passionately, his hand sliding up my damp tights to the soaking knickers 
      between my legs. The result was electrifying. Holding my pee for so long 
      and the rubbing of my wet pants had already made me feel quite randy and 
      as he kneeded me through the wet material I was ecstatic and came almost 
      instantly, as did he. Wow!<br><br>Discussing it later Jim admitted that he found my desperation a real 
      turn on and had often wondered if my pants were wet after a match. 
      Actually they had been rather damp several times but I had always changed 
      into a spare pair in the loo. I hadn't noticed it at the time but he had 
      almost come in his pants when I had admitted that I had started to wet 
      myself. My deliberate accident behind the van had been the most exciting 
      thing he had ever seen. We talked about it for a long time and I mentioned 
      the times I had been caught short in my knickers on the way home from 
      clubs.<br><br>Anyway, I showered and changed and we went out for meal and a drink. I 
      was about to use the loo before we left but Jim stopped me, saying we 
      would be home in under a half hour. So we left. Of course, I was soon 
      bursting and decided to play with Jim, telling him I was desperate, 
      stopping with crossed legs, dancing about and complaining that I was going 
      to wet my knickers if I didn't get home soon. Amazingly I made it almost 
      to the door when suddenly my bladder muscles just gave up. A hot wetness in my pants and I just lost control, standing there 
      weeing my knickers and tights for the second time that day. As soon as we 
      were in the house we threw ourselves on the bed for the most fantastic 
      session.<br><br>We played this game many times after this. It certainly solved my 
      dilemma at the matches as I found that by keeping my legs together and 
      letting go slowly I could wet myself without anybody noticing, provided 
      that I wore dark tights and skirt. There weren't many times that I went 
      home with dry knickers. I split up with Jim eventually, but continue to 
      find solo pleasure in my wet activities. And I still wee in my knickers 
      rather than use filthy public loos or when I simply cannot be bothered to 
      search for a toilet.<br><br>
