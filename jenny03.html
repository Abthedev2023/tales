    Trip to the Grocery Store</strong></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>I want to tell you
    about when I went shopping last night.... I was kind of dying to pee when I arrived - I
    came straight from work. I went to the local Coles&#146; (a supermarket here) and looked
    for a ladies, but couldn't find one! Not wanting to waste too much time, I went for the
    'quick shop', and thought I could maybe get home. While I enjoy peeing in my panties, I am
    not usually a public person! Anyway, with a couple of minor 'drips', and a bit of holding
    and crossing my legs, I made it to the last aisle... But I had forgotten two things - so I
    went to the first and then the problem started! While walking to the next item, I bumped
    into a corner (trying to rush I suppose) and let out a bigger gush of pee... Then when I
    was trying to get that last thing (a packet of biscuits - I had friends coming over the
    next day), another even bigger squirt came out! It would not have been so bad if I had a
    skirt on, as there were not too many people there and no one in my aisle - but I had a
    pair of slacks on, and a patch appeared at the middle that was slowly growing! I undid my
    zipper and put my hand down, but all I got was more pee. Since no one was there I let go
    some more so I would survive on the way out. My slacks are black (work uniform), so it
    only showed if you looked carefully - though my shoes were squeaking and there was a
    little puddle under my legs. Anyway, I managed to get out, and if anyone noticed they did
    not make it too obvious - I planned to finish off by going behind my car in the car park,
    but there were two guys in the car two over having a chat! I would have been too obvious
    to squat, so I stood behind my car, acted like i was on the phone, and because they could
    only see my &quot;top half&quot; I just let it all go in my panties and slacks... I even
    managed to give myself a little rub between the legs, and left... Embarrassing as hell,
    but I must admit, I enjoyed it in the end! Somehow doing stuff like this in public makes
    the orgasm I have afterwards really good!</p>
