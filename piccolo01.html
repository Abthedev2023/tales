    <td valign="top" bgcolor="#F4F4F4" width="85%"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>Rigid</strong><br>
    <br>
    </font><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#000000">She stood, with her hands together behind her back, her feet together
    side-by side, her back straight, her face forward. Standing to attention. Wincing against
    the intense feeling in her bladder, as though it would burst at any moment. In front of
    her, the giggling continued.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'I don't know who you are,' she whispered,
    'but this isn't funny.' The giggling grew a little louder. She frowned, and wished she
    could duck down, or bend her knees, or do anything to stop this feeling that churned
    inside her, but she could not.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Her name was Jodie Knight, and she had been
    on her way to work. She was only nineteen and had recently started a job working as a
    cashier at a local bank. It was fairly standard, all she ever had to do was count out
    money for people, write checks, accept checks, stamp things, sign things. She was all
    right at it. Today, the first day back after a two-week bank holiday to celebrate one
    hundred years of service, she was dressed in the uniform, which was in itself quite
    ordinary, a short black skirt reaching to somewhere just above her knees, a blue blouse
    with a name tag. Her blonde hair fell about her shoulders, but would be tied into a bun
    when she reached the bank.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Why, then, could she no longer move? It had
    happened in an instant, she had stopped moving, and her body had taken on a life of its
    own. She had not commanded herself to stand up straight, put her feet together, put her
    hands behind her back, eyes up, back straight, chest out, but here she was, and now she
    couldn't move.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'It's not funny,' she repeated to the
    invisible pranksters, 'where are </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">you?' She had been standing here now for
    what seemed like an age. She wasn't able to look at her watch, since her hands were locked
    behind her back, but she guessed, from the changes in traffic on the roads nearby and the
    occasional mentions of the time from passers by to one another, that at least an hour and
    a half had passed. She was standing on a corner, near a cross-roads, somewhere on the
    outer rings of the center of town. Cars went by, people went by, and nobody really noticed
    she was there. She was just a girl, standing up. Desperate for the toilet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'I can't stand here much longer,' she
    warned. Why couldn't she see whoever it was? She could quite clearly hear their voices
    sniggering in front of her, but there was nobody there. The feeling was coming on stronger
    now. She had been holding on since before she left the house. She had already been late
    and thought it would be okay, she could go for a wee as soon as she had reached the bank
    and apologized for her lateness. But she had decided to make herself wait until she got
    there. It would make her get there faster. Now, she longed to wrap her legs together,
    grind her thighs, even grab on with a hand, anything, to make it easier to hold on. What
    was she going to do? If she was here much longer she would wet herself in full view of the
    public. But how could she move? She was completely stuck, none of her limbs would do what
    she said. It was as though a spell had been cast over her. The feeling washed through her
    again. She closed her eyes and held on with as many muscles as she could. She didn't know
    how she was going to get through this.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Who are you?' she asked again, looking
    around her. The giggling jabbered louder, then died down a little, turning into excited
    breathing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Do you need the toilet?' asked a small
    voice in front of her, straining against the urge to laugh. The voice sounded as though it
    belonged to a boy of about twelve. She chose not to reply. There was a pause, and a
    further whispered snigger.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">A second boy's voice chirped next: 'Do you
    need a wee?' They both laughed. 'Look, I don't know where you are, and I'm very impressed.
    Well done. Now can we finish it please?' As soon as she had spoken, she regretted it. Now
    they knew they were getting to her. She waited. There was no reply. Finally there was a
    burst of saliva-drenched air at about waist-height to her. It sounded as though one of
    them had been holding their breath, trying not to laugh, and had finally given up. Who
    were these kids? Where were they hiding and how had they managed to throw their voices
    like that? Suddenly she felt a strong twinge from her bladder which forced her eyes shut.
    She wanted to screw her hands into fists to help her hold on, but she simply couldn't
    move. Her arms, her legs, her hands and feet, her neck, her back - they were all frozen
    stiff, as though iron clamps had been locked around them. The feeling was intense. She had
    never thought about it before, but the body must do so many things automatically to soften
    the feeling of a full bladder, and now she could do none of them she was suddenly aware of
    each one. She longed for them. A slight bend at the waist would do the trick, a quick
    squeeze with one hand perhaps, or smaller things like wringing her hands, folding her
    arms, bending one knee, biting her nails, flexing her fingers, anything. But, she was
    totally helpless to these kids.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She couldn't feel anything around her arms,
    binding them. She suspected that must be because she hadn't moved them for a long time, so
    any pressure on them from the handcuffs, or whatever they were, had stopped feeling like
    pressure at all. Or perhaps it was because it paled in comparison to the pressure she was
    feeling elsewhere. She made sure she definitely couldn't move. It was true. Here she was,
    standing up straight, on a street corner. People were walking by, looking at her, and two
    invisible schoolboys were laughing in front of her. This was insane. Another wave swept
    through her with force. She gritted her teeth and did all she could to hold on. It was
    very difficult. She felt like she was going to burst any second.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The boys began to laugh again. 'You need
    the toilet don't you?' one of them sniggered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Have you weed your pants yet?' asked the
    other. This was horrible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'There's a toilet over there if you need
    one,' said the first voice, sympathetically. She turned her eyes to look, and saw that
    yes, there was in fact a toilet block about two minutes away, down the road. She grimaced.
    'Why don't you go, if you need it?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Yeah, why don't you go and have a wee? You
    can go there now look, it's just there. You can just let it all go.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Let it all just flow out of you,' said the
    other, fighting back laughter. Jodie was frantic. She bore her teeth involuntarily. Her
    eyes were wide with concentration. She was sure she couldn't hold on for much longer, and
    letting go simply wasn't an option, though she longed to. She was on a public street,
    everyone would see her, she might be arrested, and she would certainly lose her job.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Why won't you let me go?' she asked
    desperately, wishing she could see who was doing this to her, or understand how.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'What do you mean?' one of the boys
    replied, in the worst display of fake innocence she had ever heard. 'You can go, right
    now, go on, just run over to the toilet, pull down your pants and let it all shoot out of
    you like a waterfall. I'll help you with the pants if you need me to.' She was livid. How
    dare they treat her like this? Who were they?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Or you could stay standing here, but all
    that'll happen then is you'll wet yourself.' Their voices were tinged with gleeful malice
    now. 'He's right. It'll happen soon.' They were right. 'Very soon,' the boy continued.
    'You'll feel it running down your legs any minute. You might as well just let go now.
    It'll go running down your legs into a big puddle on the floor...'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Jodie wanted to scream. Every word they
    said made her imagine it, made her closer to letting go. Her body was telling her to
    listen to them, to let it just drop out of her, to end that horrible feeling. She looked
    over to the left. Who could she call to for help? There was an old man, sitting at a bus
    stop, reading today's paper. But he had a hearing aid, and even as she watched him he
    tapped at it, to try and get it to work. He would be no use.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Maybe she can't?' one of the boys' voices
    suggested.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Yeah, maybe she's too embarrassed.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'She shouldn't be. Maybe we can help her?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Yeah, perhaps we should help her take off
    her pants?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Jodie looked around her. There had to be
    someone else. Then she felt those hateful fingers worm their way up inside her skirt. They
    closed around her pants, and began to pull. Her eyes widened. She could do nothing. She
    tried to lash out, to stop him, but she was frozen stiff. Her panic set her bladder
    ablaze. She could barely hold on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Don't you dare!' There was a brief moment,
    and then the boy let go, leaving them in place. He had only been teasing her, he wasn't
    going to pull them down anyway. Then it wouldn't have looked like her fault.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Well then,' said the boy, 'if she doesn't
    like that...'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Perhaps we can help her in another way?'
    the other boy joined in, latching on to what the first was getting at. Jodie's eyebrows
    arched. A cold string of panic rippled down her, thumping into her bladder, teasing out a
    tiny droplet. She screwed her eyes shut and tried to hold on, but her insides felt as
    though they were a hundred times too big, as though the skin on her bladder was stretched
    to its limit, stretching and hurting and itching. She could feel the pressure of the
    liquid inside her pressing down hard. Soon it would break through. There was too much of
    it already.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'Perhaps... we could tickle it out of her?'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'That's a good idea...'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">'No!' Her outburst sent a small jet into
    her underpants, which felt immediately heavy. She breathed out a rapid sigh, her eyes
    wide, her expression frantic. She had to move, had to reach the public toilet before it
    was too late. Another squirt, and another. And then it broke free, flooding out of her in
    a vast torrent. She felt it cascade down her legs, around her skirt, across her ankles and
    onto the floor in a rapidly growing puddle.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The boys cheered, and laughed. Suddenly she
    was free. She floundered, flopping this way and that, tying to walk and hold on at the
    same time, but she couldn't stop it, and now half of her didn't want to, it felt
    beautiful, the way it was gushing out, relief filling her senses. She tried for the
    direction of the toilet, but was too weak, and fell into a lamp post which she had to hold
    on to for support. There she stood, leaning against the lamp post, with a river flowing
    out of her. Her shoulders heaved. She didn't know if she was laughing or crying. It felt
    so good.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Minutes passed. She was still leaning on
    the lamp. She suddenly snapped back into the world, as though she had been drifting off to
    sleep. Nobody was around. She looked down and saw that her skirt was drenched. If she went
    home now it wouldn't be too late to call in sick, or to change and just be late. But she
    needed something to cover herself up with, before anyone saw. The voices of the boys could
    no longer be heard. She wondered whether she had dreamt the whole thing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">She noticed that the old man had gone,
    leaving his newspaper behind. Stumbling over to the bench at the bus stop, she reached
    down to grab the paper. She could hold it in front of her and nobody would notice her
    accident. As she went for it, something attracted her attention on the front page. She
    bent down and read it more closely.<br>

    <p><font face="Courier" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>'TWO SCHOOLBOYS DIE IN BANK
    TOILET - Parents Grieve</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>Schoolboys Ryan Arnold and Jason
    Frink died early this morning after being locked inside a bank toilet for more than two
    weeks. The boys had come into the bank armed with marker pens, aiming to deface the walls
    wherever they could. Locating the staff toilet, they sneaked inside. Unfortunately, the
    bank was just about to be locked up for the night. With all staff accounted for, the
    cleaners had no reason to check in case anyone was in there.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier" size="2" color="#000000"><strong>Celebrating one hundred years in
    business, the bank closed for a period of two weeks, with all water facilities turned off.
