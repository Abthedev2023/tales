    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Melissa crossed her legs and tried
    to look normal as she listened to the professor and took notes, but beneath her desk she
    was more than distracted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All the coke she
    had at lunch was now anxious to leave her body and her bladder was filled to the max.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She squeezed her thighs together and tried to
    ignore the pressure between her legs and pay attention to the professor instead.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She glanced up at the clock on the wall - 30 more
    minutes until this class was due to get out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    hoped the lesson would be short and the professor would let the class out early.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mother Nature was offering no
    assistance as a heavy rain fell steadily outside the window to her right.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The constant sound of rain on the roof and
    splashing was only making Melissa's problem even worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>It had been pouring all day and there was no indication that it would end
    anytime soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Melissa happened to remember
    that she forgot her umbrella in her room this morning and would have to walk back to her
    dorm through the rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Great,&quot; she
    thought, &quot;What else can go wrong?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ten minutes passed and Melissa was
    beginning to worry about her ability to wait until class ended to go to the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She could get up to leave at anytime now that she
    was in college, but she didn't like to miss notes and there was only 20 minutes left in
    class anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she thought about wetting
    her pants in front of the class and decided it wouldn't be worth the risk.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she put her pencil down and was about to get up
    to go to the bathroom, the professor announced that he didn't have much else for the day
    and that class would get out early.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Relieved,
    Melissa decided she could wait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    re-crossed her legs and squeezed her thighs together as the professor gave the class a
    reading assignment and everyone began to put their books into their bags and rise to
    leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She put her notes into her folder and
    leaned over to slide the folder into her backpack - as she did her right leg and butt
    lifted off of the seat, momentarily releasing her hold on her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gasped and held her breath as she felt a spurt
    of pee leak out into her panties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sat
    back down quickly, stopping the flow.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Only a
    second or two had escaped before she regained control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She looked down between her legs and saw no wet spot.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She breathed a sigh of relief, made sure she had
    control once again, picked up her bag from the floor and stood to leave.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She left the room and turned towards
    the bathroom down the hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she turned
    the corner by the bathroom she was horrified to find them locked with a sign reading
    &quot;Closed for Renovation.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her heart
    sank slightly in her chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next nearest
    bathroom was over in the next building, but she was finished with classes for the day and
    decided that heading back to her dorm room was a better idea.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only a block away, she figured.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another strong urge convinced her to start
    walking.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She headed for the exit and tried
    not to seem too desperate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her jeans were
    tight and every step placed a little more pressure on her full bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried taking shallow breaths to keep from
    expanding her stomach too much, but it didn't help her much.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She got to the door and looked outside.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rain was pouring, puddles covered the ground and
    the wind blew the rain at an angle. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Another
    short spurt of pee shot into her panties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    held her breath and grabbed her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    could now feel the wetness in the crotch of her jeans with her fingers.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only a small area of wetness, but she knew
    it would get bigger any minute if she didn't get back to her room very soon.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A boy opened the door to get into the building
    from outside, momentarily glancing at her as she held her hand at her crotch.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She realized he was looking and quickly stepped
    out the door and into the rain.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She ran out onto the sidewalk,
    feeling the rain falling on her head and shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    tried to avoid the large puddles but it was almost impossible.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every running step she took splashed water up onto
    her ankles and lower legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon the rain
    soaked the top of her shirt and the bottom of her jeans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The wetness was more than she could take.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Every step she took caused another spurt of pee to leak into her panties.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few more steps the spurts were becoming
    more constant and she could feel the warmth beginning to spread from her crotch to the top
    of her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There was another building to
    her right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She turned towards it and stopped
    against the wall, turning her back to the wall as she lost control.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pee flooded into her jeans.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wet spot began to grow between her thighs - up
    her crotch and back, down both legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She held
    her breath and looked around as she let her bladder empty. Luckily the rain had most
    people inside so there were no witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    looked down and watched the wet stain spread down her legs until it merged with the
    splashes from the puddles above her ankles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    had never felt more relieved or embarrassed in her life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>College girls aren't supposed to piss themselves, she thought.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As her pee slowed to a stop she now
    began to worry about what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even with
    the rain stains all over her it was still quite obvious that she had wet her pants.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her only hope was to walk slowly through the rain
    and hope that enough drops would find her to blur the evidence of her accident.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked slowly through the rain, miserable and
    embarrassed until she reached the safety of her room.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
