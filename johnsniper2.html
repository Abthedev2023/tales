    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1995, I shared an apartment with Natalie (22) and her friend, Carl (23), in Sea
    Point, Cape Town. Up until this point I had never seen Natalie so much as blink in
    desperation, which later I wrote off to her having too many inhibitions about relieving
    herself in public and an inherited strong bladder. So any chances of seeing her wet
    herself was relatively non-existent to say the least. We were lovers at that time, but she
    was more than likely too shy to let me in on any possible secrets.</p>
    <p align="left">Anyway, the Gods must have been smiling on me that week in mid-October
    when she developed cystitis (a urinary infection &#150; frequent urge to urinate &amp;
    hyper-acidity i.e. burning urine), which changed things dramatically. As you will
    see&#133;<br>
    <br>
    I woke up at 7:30 in the morning, rolled out of bed, got dressed and went downstairs into
    the kitchen to have breakfast. It was still dark outside and so I had to turn on the light
    before putting the kettle on. I then went out and fetched the newspaper from the mailbox,
    letting the dogs out at the same time. When I got back, I got my mug ready (sugar/coffee)
    and tossed the newspaper down on the table. I then made myself a bowl of cereal before
    pouring my coffee and sitting down at the table.<br>
    <br>
    I must have read for about ten minutes, before I heard Carl moving around in the room
    above the kitchen and a minute later, he came downstairs and disappeared into the
    bathroom. Then I heard him flush the toilet before turning on the shower, as he did just
    like any other day, and so I went back to eating my cereal.<br>
    A second later, I heard Natalie come shuffling down the stairs and looked up to see her in
    her knee-length white nightgown. &quot;Why don&#146;t you get dressed before coming
    down?&quot;, I asked her, as she walked into the kitchen.<br>
    Natalie stopped in the middle of the floor, having heard the shower running and said,
    &quot;How far is Carl?&quot;.<br>
    &quot;He just got in. Why?&quot;, I asked, as I started reading the business section.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oof. I need to have a pee&#133;&quot;, she sighed, as she gazed at the bathroom door
    with a longing in her eyes.<br>
    Needless to say, I forgot about the &quot;business section&quot; pretty much in the blink
    of an eye and replied, &quot;Why don&#146;t you take your mind off it, make some toast for
    yourself and then come sit down.&quot;. <br>
    She then walked over to the counter and started fiddling around with the toaster, as she
    checked the wall-clock every now and then. I could see that she was wiggling her right leg
    nervously and I was very tempted to sneak up behind her and slip my hand under her
    nightgown. &quot;Damn it&#133; The sound of the shower&#146;s only making me have to go
    even more urgently!&quot;, she moaned, as her toast popped up and she started buttering it
    before walking over to the table. She then sat down and started munching half-heartedly on
    her toast, while perspiration dripped down the sides of her face, &quot;Ooh&#133; Sheez,
    my bladder is bursting, I&#146;ve never felt this full before, and it&#146;s
    burning&#133;&quot;. I could see that she was opening and closing her legs repeatedly with
    a frantic desperation that said it all.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Just hang on a little while longer, baby. He is almost finished now.&quot;, I said
    sympathetically and then got up and walked over to the sink. <br>
    The moment that I turned on the water to rinse my bowl, she went into a flat panic and
    wedged her hands in her groin, &quot;Don&#146;t do that! You&#146;re making me wet
    myself!&quot;.<br>
    &quot;I have to rinse my bowl out, baby&#133;&quot;, I replied, as I emptied the bowl by
    intentionally pouring it into a plate that was full of water.<br>
    <br>
    Instantly, she began squirming like a caged animal and, once my bowl was empty, I heard a
    brief spurt of piss squirt in her lap, followed by two more, as I then put it in the
    drying-rack. &quot;Oh, fuck. I can&#146;t wait anymore!&quot;, she whimpered, as she got
    up and started wobbling towards the bathroom door with her hands still wedged between her
    tightly clenched thighs.<br>
    As she stood up, I saw that the nightgown had gone transparent at the junction of her
    thighs and butt, where it had stuck against the underside of her butt. &quot;Baby, your
    nightgown is going see-through&#133;&quot;, I stated alarmed and unable to take my eyes
    off of the underside of her butt that was so suggestively stuck out at me. Instantly, she
    blushed and hid her butt away from me, in the process, not realising that she was exposing
    her front to me. (To be honest, I nearly came in my shorts at this point) For there was a
    wet spot the size of a sandwich plate in her lap that left nothing to the imagination, as
    I could see her pubic hair squashed under her left hand and, as her legs were then open
    (having just hid her butt from view), I could see that she was pushing her hand down and
    across her clit. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can&#146;t help it! I&#146;m going to pee myself&#133;&quot;, she whined, as I saw
    a new wave of wetness make the stain expand slightly.<br>
    &quot;For it all it matters, technically, you&#146;ve already started.&quot;, I chuckled.<br>
    She went beet red, &quot;It&#146;s not funny! I have never had to pee this bad before in
    my life!&quot;, as she began sobbing. She then banged on the door and shouted, &quot;Come
    on, Carl. Please! I&#146;m bursting to get to the toilet&#133;&quot;.<br>
    &quot;I&#146;ll be out in a second. Just let me rinse the soap out of my hair.&quot;, he
    replied.<br>
    &quot;Oooh, fuck. Hurry up! I can&#146;t wait!&quot;, she shouted, as she began squirming
    and bobbing up and down, while she hopped around on one foot with her right leg swinging
    up across her left.<br>
    &quot;Okay. Okay. I&#146;m coming out.&quot;, Carl said, as he turned off the water.<br>
    <br>
    Natalie&#146;s face contorted in a grimace, as her right leg whipped around like a tree
    branch in a windstorm, and I saw a trickle of piss race down the inside of her left leg.
    At the same time, I saw the wet spot expand out across her lap and a trail of piss run
    down to the hem of her nightgown along her left leg. She then dropped down into a crouch,
    with her butt below her knees, and I heard squelching noises coming from her crotch, as
    she swung her back to me. She then started whimpering pathetically, as the wet stain on
    her butt surged up the back, revealing her glistening creamy white buttocks through the
    material, and piss began cascading from her butt on to the floor.<br>
    <br>
    At that point, Carl opened the bathroom door and looked straight at her, as she sat frozen
    in that position with piss flooding the wooden floor underneath her. After almost half a
    minute, she managed to stop peeing and stand up again, with a 1½ metre (±4.5 foot) pool
    of piss around her feet. She then rushed into the bathroom, passed Carl.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Phew, sorry&#133;&quot;, he said carefully hopping over the puddle in front of the
    door and going upstairs.<br>
    When he was gone, I went into the bathroom, closing the door behind me, and stood for a
    second admiring her soaked nightgown, as she stared down in disbelief at the mess she had
    made of herself (just like a little girl). I have never felt more in love with her than at
    that point &#150; there is something about the image of her, as the helpless little girl
    that made me want to hug her and care for her. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;I am so embarrassed!&quot;, she sobbed, looking down at the amber stains in her
    nightgown, &quot;I will never be able to look him in the face again&#133;&quot; She then
    sat down on the floor, hugging her knees to her and rocking back and forth, as she burst
    into tears.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes, you will.&quot;, I said consolingly, as I got undressed and lifted her off the
    floor, &quot;Come on, let&#146;s get you cleaned up.&quot;. I then lead her into the
    shower and turned the water on, as I ran my hands over her nightgown, feeling her body
    beneath the flimsy material. <br>
    She never took her eyes of my erection, as she said, &quot;Why do I get the impression
    that you just got turned-on watching me wet myself?&quot;, with a naughty look on her
    face.<br>
    &quot;I don&#146;t know&#133; Maybe an overactive imagination?&quot;, I joked and just got
    time to breathe, as she hiked her dripping nightgown up and then impaled herself, so to
    speak. That was the first time that the two of us had ever had <b>REALLY WET</b> sex and,
    which I still remember fondly.<br>
