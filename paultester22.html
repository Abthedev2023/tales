    <br>
    Sitting on the coach, desperate to pee, Joan was trying everything she knew to help
    herself wait, to contain the pee in the bursting bladder, to hold back the pressure that
    was reaching danger level.<br>
    <br>
    Without meaning to, her hand had slipped down from her aching bladder area and into her
    lap. These thoughts of a loo had made her want to pee more urgently, so, she was horrified
    to find, she was pressing both hands between her twisted legs. Realising what she was
    doing made her pull her hands away quickly, before anyone could see what she was doing.
    She wanted to pee so badly! But, she reminded herself, women of her age did not hold
    themselves in public, in fact, they did not hold themselves at all. They could make
    themselves wait for the loo without behaving like a little girl.<br>
    <br>
    She could not stop another groan of desperation; she was absolutely desperate for a pee,
    and holding herself would have felt so good. If only she could do something to make this
    desperate, urgent, need to pee go away. If only there was something she could do, except
    of course, pee. What would she give for a chance to pee right now? Even in one of those
    new 'super-loos.'<br>
    <br>
    She wanted to go so badly she would happily pay, if only they could stop. 10p? That would
    be a bargain if she could pee NOW! It was becoming an emergency. 50p or even ú1 would not
    be too much. In fact, she didn't want to think about it, but she would pay almost anything
    to get into a loo and PEE, before she wanted to go any more urgently, before she was in
    danger of wetting her knickers. She was bursting, desperately bursting for a pee and her
    bladder was nearing critical level, throbbing like an overblown balloon. She could not
    keep putting it off for much longer. She was going to have to pee soon. The awful thought
    was that she might not be able to get to a loo soon enough: then what could she do? No loo
    meant no peeing! That was all there was to it. Either the coach stopped at a loo, or she
    would have to wait until they reached Oxford Street, their destination.<br>
    <br>
    Until then, somehow, she had to make herself wait. How? That did not matter, if there was
    no loo, it was no pee, and that meant wait. She must, she had to wait, what else could she
    do? Wet her pants? That was out of the question! Hold it! No choice but to make herself
    hold it. If it got too bad to bear with just crossing her legs she would have to resort to
    holding herself. If she put her handbag on her lap that might hide what she was doing, and
    if she could hold herself would she be able to wait? If you held yourself tightly enough,
    you could always wait, surely?<br>
    <br>
    Why did it have to be her that was dying to pee? Didn't anyone else on the coach want to
    go? Wasn't there any chance that somebody else might get the coach to stop at a loo? Was
    there a loo they could stop at? If only they would! Just for 2 or 3 minutes, that was all
    she asked for. 2 minutes in a loo and all her troubles would flow away, like the stream of
    pee she so, so, wanted to let pour out of her aching bladder.<br>
    <br>
    They drove past a garage with a tempting 'Toilets' sign outside. If only the coach had
    needed some petrol and had stopped there, she would have had no hesitation in getting off
    and asking to use the toilets. In despair she looked around the coach for support, for
    some sign that she was not the only person desperate to stop for a pee.<br>
    <br>
    Amy, her closest friend, sitting next to her, had her legs crossed, but she did not look
    the slightest bit stressed, and Joan thought ruefully, she had never known Amy want a pee
    when they had been out together. Behind was a group of youngsters, all enjoying
    themselves; she thought they had brought some cans of cider or beer on the coach and had
    been drinking them. A tall blonde girl, she only knew as Val, was laughing and cuddling up
    to a rather attractive young man. They had both been drinking, and, Joan cringed at the
    thought; if she had been drinking like they had she would not just be crossing her legs,
    she would be absolutely flat out desperate, about to pee herself, or even worse, sitting
    in wet knickers. Or she would have made the driver stop so she could pee.<br>
    <br>
    She could not understand why they hadn't demanded a stop at the last services; they must
    want to go. How on earth was Val managing? She was still drinking and the only sign of her
    needing a loo was that she had her legs crossed, but casually, not desperately twisted
    like Joan's. Her jeans were amazing, she had never seen such a tight fitting pair, and
    they must have been sprayed on her!<br>
    <br>
    Joan was reluctantly reminded that she no longer had the figure to wear such jeans. She
    ought to go on a diet, but it was easier to wear skirts and 'control' underwear to squeeze
    her figure into shape. She was wearing a new skirt on this outing and to look her best she
    had needed her tightest 'control' knickers to squeeze her into shape. She looked
    presentable but she had not bargained for wanting a loo so badly. The control part of her
    knickers was designed to give her a flat stomach, and the pressure needed do that was,
    unfortunately, bearing full on her bladder area.<br>
    <br>
    Normally she welcomed the pressure there as it gave her a 'young' shape, the flat tummy
    and tight bum fashionable clothes demanded. Now she longed to be wearing her older,
    casual, clothes she messed about the house in. An old skirt or her loose fitting trousers
    and cotton panties were not 'smart' but they did not press on her bursting bladder, and,
    at that moment, she was more interested in comfort that fashion. Anything that could ease
    the aching pressure in her bladder area would be so wonderful. A pee, a long, glorious,
    gushing pee would be the best thing, but if that was out of the question, then less
    pressure on her poor, aching, bursting, bladder would be so wonderful.<br>
    <br>
    Joan stifled a groan of desperation and tried to twist her legs even tighter together.
    Thinking about a pee was making her worse. Her need to pee getting more urgent, and the
    pressure in her aching bladder was rising, rising, every minute, so it was taking more
    effort to hold back. 'Oh God! What can I do?' she thought to herself. She wanted to pee so
    desperately. The pressure in her bladder was getting worse, so bad she was beginning to
    struggle to hold her pee. She was almost gritting her teeth with the effort it was taking
    to control her bursting bladder and, as she squirmed on the seat and pressed her thighs
    tighter together, one thought was uppermost in her mind: 'I can't wait much longer! Oh
    please! I must pee soon. What can I do? I want to pee!'<br>
    <br>
    In response to this desperation her hand was resting in her lap and her fingers reaching
    between her legs. She was trying so hard to hang on, and she was so desperate she needed
    something, anything to help her wait. She had to wait, she simply had no choice, and there
    was nowhere she could pee. If it got any worse she would have to hold herself; it was
    awful to be thinking that, but anything, even openly holding between her legs, was better
    than wetting herself in public.<br>
