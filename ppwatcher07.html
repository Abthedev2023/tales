    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I won't go into
    what happened that evening as for one it was between Stacey and I and secondly, it has
    nothing to do with pee. It's enough for you to know that it was a great evening, and one
    that I will never forget.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As I woke up the next morning,
    Stacey was curled up in the crook of my arm contently sleeping.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was great, and I gazed on her beautiful face.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, I couldn't gaze long for I needed the
    ever-necessary morning piss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I quietly
    slipped out of bed and walked into the bathroom for a leak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I was so preoccupied with getting ready to take much-needed piss I didn't
    even hear Stacey come up behind me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    reached around and took my cock in her hand and said let me point it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always wanted to &quot;write my name in the
    snow.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With Stacey's hand grasping my
    cock it took a couple of minutes for me to get going.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I must say that I was very surprised by this little activity on her part,
    especially after the previous evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I
    finished she started to let go and I told her not yet; you have to shake first.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She giggled and said what for.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her to get the last few drops out and she
    giggled and started to shake my cock up and down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
    a few seconds I told her that was enough and if she didn't stop I would be carrying her
    back to the bedroom for more than just sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Stacey laughed and said I better not
    unless I wanted her to piss all over the carpet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    said get out of the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Watching you pee has
    me desperate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I started to leave so she could
    pee and she told me that I didn't have to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    stared at her and she said that she found it kind of exciting last night when I watched
    her pee in the garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told me that she
    was still terribly embarrassed, but that as she thought about it later she found it also
    to be terribly exciting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As she sat there I
    notice that nothing was happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I began to
    kid her about not being able to pee with me there and she told me to shut up so she could
    concentrate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After a few more seconds she let
    out a sigh and said it was no use, she had to pee like a racehorse but nothing would come
    out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I laughed and told her I didn't think
    she really needed to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She grabbed my hand
    with out saying a thing and put it just above her pubic mound.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was as hard as a rock and she moaned a little
    as I pushed down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked at me and said I
    got to pee, I guess I'm just too shy to pee in front of you right now.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I asked her if she wanted me to take
    her out to the garage and she laughed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
    that laugh I heard a little squirt shoot out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    began to tickle her and the floodgates opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
    a giggle and a sigh she peed noisily into the bowl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    she finished she wiped and off we went to fix breakfast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>As we worked on breakfast she and I we began to talk began to explain how
    hard it was for her to pee around people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    said it began as a little girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she
    never could go in front of other people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    grade school she hated to go to the bathroom because there were no stall doors.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She would often hang around so she could be the
    last one to use the bathroom after all the other girls had left.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Stacey confided in me that she could
    not always be the last one and then she would just wait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Some times that wait would result in her wetting her pants in class and the
    other kids would tease her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Stacey also had to be careful when
    she was out playing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She said her friends,
    both boys and girls would just go pee behind a tree when they were playing, but she never
    could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She always had to rush home or risk
    peeing her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that she tried
    once, but nothing would come out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As she was
    squatting with her pants down one of the little neighborhood boys came up and saw her and
    she ran off crying, and pulling her pants up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    said that by the time she got to her doorstep the pee was running down her legs. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Stacey told me the worst was when
    she and her family were traveling in the car on a trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She had to pee and told her dad that she needed to go.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were not near any towns she kept telling her
    dad she had to peepee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She said her dad got
    mad and pulled over on the side of the road and made her pee there.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Try as she might she just could not pee squatting
    outside the car. Her dad got mad and told her she didn't really need to go and to get in
    the car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later she couldn't help
    herself and wet her pants in the car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    said that she had always been pee shy around people. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After breakfast, we kicked around,
    watched some TV, took a walk and just enjoyed being together.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About 10:00 that morning Stacey quietly got up,
    walked over, took my hand and said come with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    walked into my back yard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately I had a
    privacy fence around the back yard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stacey
    said she had to go again and wanted to pee in the great outdoors.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She stripped off her jeans, squatted and tried to
    go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing happened but she would not give
    up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She kept squatting and trying.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I offered to leave and she said no, but then asked
    if I would turn around a second. I did so with her not knowing that I could see her
    reflection in one of the windows.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A few
    seconds later, I heard a sigh and saw the first squirt of pee reflected off the glass.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and Stacey was smiling and peeing,
    peeing and smiling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she was done she
    shook her ass and laughed saying that she always wanted to be able to do that. For the
    rest of the day, whenever she had to pee, she insisted that I be there.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And who was I to refuse.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each time it became easier and easier for her to
    pee in front of me so that by the end of the day I didn't even need to turn around.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She also got a great delight with holding my cock
    for me whenever I had to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was like a
    kid in a candy store and could not get enough of this newfound adventure.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At one point that afternoon while
    she was again peeing in the backyard she noticed that I had a raging hard on.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked if her peeing excited me and I told her
    that it did very much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When she finished she
    led me to a chair on my patio sitting me in it and then straddled me.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When she was done and I was well spent she looked
    at me and smiled telling me that if her peeing got me that hard she would have to pee a
    lot more for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sure didn't lie about
    that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It led to some great wet adventures.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that is another story...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
