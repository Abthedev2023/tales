    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We were eighteen, shy
    and innocent; had been summer friends for ten years. Both families having cabins by the
    small lake, we just had to be together. There were more young people around that we met,
    became friends, drifted apart. But Kate was something special. And that summer something
    changed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was the annual midsummer feast,
    everybody gathering in the clearing by the bay, barbecuing, playing games, children
    dipping their toes. My family had arrived that afternoon, my little sister seeking her
    best friend, and I hoped Kate was there. She was.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Brown hair parted in the middle,
    green eyes, her body a little rounder than last year. Dressed in a white blouse and Levi's
    jeans, barefoot in sandals. There was something in the air the instant we met.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Oh the innocence.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This is in a country where the
    concept of &quot;dating&quot; is totally unknown; it's perfectly normal and accepted for a
    boy and a girl to be together informally, I could drop in on her anytime, we could go for
    a walk, we could slip off somewhere with no fear of retribution. Maybe because of that we
    felt that we had all the time in the world, there was no need to rush anything.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We talked, summing up the past year,
    I watched the way she brushed her hair back behind her ear, followed the movement of her
    lips, noticed the curves of her hips in the worn jeans, saw the hint of straps under her
    blouse. She had no boyfriend, and I had no girlfriend. Pause.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let's walk,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She led through the trees, to
    another undisturbed bay. It was way past midnight, but still light. The smaller children
    had gone to bed, and the grown-ups relaxed with lake-chilled beer. I watched her bottom as
    she walked, brushing past the bushes, jumping fallen branches. We sat on the boulders in
    our special place, silent.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Want to bathe?&quot; I
    wondered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I didn't bring a ...&quot; She
    smiled at me. &quot;Stupid answer. Of course I will.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She rose, still smiling. Unbuttoned
    her blouse ever so slowly. Kicked off her sandals, unzipped her jeans, folding her clothes
    neatly. She wore white cotton panties and kept her bra on. I'd seen girls in magazines,
    undressed in all kinds of underwear, but this was the sexiest sight I'd seen. We stepped
    gingerly down to the water, shivering as it rose to our knees and above. I watched her
    thighs slip into the water, watched the white cotton turn dark and then disappear. Holding
    our breath we submerged, swimming outwards with slow strokes. I imagined her body gliding
    through the water. I took the opportunity to relieve myself, enjoying the warmth. I
    imagined her doing the same, letting go in the water. After some minutes we turned back
    and climbed onto the rocks again. The air was still warm; we sat down to dry.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, I forgot to pee,&quot; she
    said, smiling coyly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, you're wet
    already,&quot; I blurted out, &quot;so just go in your panties.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Okay,&quot; she said,
    spreading her legs slightly, letting it flow through the white cotton and down the rocks.
    I had to adjust myself to keep from spraining my briefs.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Let's go back,&quot; she said.
    &quot;I'm thirsty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She stood up, turned her back to me,
    and removed her underwear before putting her jeans and blouse on. I could see her nipples
    through the fabric, and the thought of her naked in her jeans turned me on immensely.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About five AM, clutching cold beers
    by the dying fire, our hands met and held.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The next day we met in the bay
    again, finding our way to the boulders. She wore a flowery dress, bra straps showing.
    Shyly we embraced and kissed, then sat down to drink Cokes and talk.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You made me pee my panties
    last night,&quot; she said, stroking my arm.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I didn't have to persuade
    you,&quot; I answered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, I just wanted to do it.
    Did you mind?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh no! It was the most sexy
    thing you've ever done.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Really?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes. It was - like we belong
    together. Doing private things in front of each other.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She squeezed my arm. &quot;Can I
    watch you pee?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I rose and unzipped my shorts. She
    stared as I sprayed the bushes, sitting with legs apart, giving me a glimpse of her
    panties under her dress. She wet her lips.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Now you,&quot; I said, zipping
    up.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Slowly she got to her feet, dress
    waving. Her breath made her breasts heave. She brushed her hair back with that familiar
    gesture and looked at me. &quot;Shall I pee for you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She touched the hem of her dress,
    coyly. Her eyes had a different expression. She lifted her dress a couple of inches,
    showing a tiny bit of white panty. Then she pulled the dress above her navel, giving me a
    flash view before dropping the hem again. &quot;You sure you want to see?&quot; She said
    teasingly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come on, Kate, show me
    again!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She lifted her dress once more, this
    time letting me see her panties and the bare belly above them. She turned around, showing
    me her lovely butt before dropping the dress again. Facing me, she reached up under her
    dress, pulled her panties down to mid-thigh, and squatted. The golden stream burst from
    her dark bush, running over the rocks under her. She let the stream dwindle, and then rose
    and pulled her panties back up. &quot;Oops,&quot; she said, &quot;the last drops went in
    my panties.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I embraced her and kissed her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Some days later we went to the bay
    again, putting our towels down on the grass fifty yards from the water. She wore her
    swimsuit under her dress, so there was no need for tricky maneuvers to undress. The
    swimsuit was dark blue and fit incredibly tight on her shapely body. Last summer the
    fabric had been hanging loosely on her chest.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After lying still for a while she
    rose on her elbows and looked at me. &quot;I have to pee,&quot; she said, crossing her
    legs for emphasis.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Just go in the water,&quot; I
    said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't feel like bathing
    yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I pointed to the bushes. &quot;Back
    there, then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Too far,&quot; she said
    lazily. &quot;Watch this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She sat up, removing the towel from
    under her. Sitting spread-legged on the grass she let go in her swimsuit, turning the
    color of her crotch into shining black with a hissing sound. &quot;There,&quot; she said,
    &quot;didn't that feel good!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I lay on my stomach to avoid
    embarrassment. She kissed my neck and whispered: &quot;One day I'll pee in your lap.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She turned nineteen in August. There
    was a party, of course, featuring everybody. I put on my best jeans and even buttoned my
    shirt all the way up. Kate was stunning. The Levi's girl was transformed into a lady, with
    her hair set up, a halter-top, and a tiny miniskirt over tan tights. We ate and drank,
    danced, and owned the world. Late in the evening she held me, eyes shining, while she
    moved from foot to foot. &quot;Martin. Come with me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Where to?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You know, when a girl's got to
    go...&quot; She squeezed her legs together. &quot;And I've got a present for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But it's your...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Shhh. Come on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Walking on high heels in the woods
    didn't seem easy, especially as she appeared to need a bathroom quite soon. Well out of
    sight of the others she stopped. &quot;Sit there. No, take your jeans off first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I did as I was told. She sat on my
    lap, straddling me, giving me a full view of her white panties through the tights under
    the short skirt. I held her butt, and she kissed me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Look at me,&quot; she said.
    &quot;No, down there. I told you I was going to do this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">To my amazement she began peeing,
    flooding her underwear and wetting her skirt. She took my hand and put it on herself,
    letting me feel the hot flow. The stream ran over my thighs. She put a hand in my briefs
    and grabbed me. &quot;Some day I'll sleep with you. But until then...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Walking back, my eyes were fixed to
    the wet crescent on her butt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The last Saturday of the holiday we
    went for a long walk. We camped by a stream, unrolling blankets and sleeping bags,
    building a fire, making tea. I had a couple of cans of beer in my sack as well. The night
    was hot. Kate sat on a log by the fire, having changed from jeans to black leggings,
    sipping beer. On the way she had stopped to pee a couple of times, just squatting in front
    of me, grinning at my interest. She emptied the can, flattened it, and put it back in my
    sack. She rubbed her belly.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;My bladder is full,&quot; she
    said. &quot;Do you want to sleep with me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I held her and nodded. She pressed
    her body against mine.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I want you in me,&quot; she
    said. &quot;God, I'm nearly wetting myself. Undress me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I pulled the sweater over her head,
    taking care to touch her breasts and soft armpits. Then I took hold of the elastic
    waistband of her leggings and pulled them down, feeling the curves of her hips. She
    wriggled her butt to aid me. Standing in bra and panties she smiled at me, both innocent
    and daring. I knelt down and kissed her belly while stroking the soft insides of her
    thighs. She moaned and held my head. I slid my hand up, cupping her sex, feeling warm
    wetness against my palm. She shivered.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come,&quot; she said, pulling
    me down on the blankets, removing my clothes. I lay beside her, stroking her belly,
    kissing her breasts, slipping my hand inside her panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She peed, a strong, short stream,
    warming my hand. I nearly came on the spot. I knelt between her legs, fascinated by the
    wet circle in her crotch. I touched it, pressing the wet fabric against her sex, prompting
    another spurt. Slowly I removed her panties, exposing her dark bush and her moist slit.
    Pressing softly on her belly made her pee again, in a beautiful golden arch. I couldn't
    wait any longer and entered her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Afterwards we lay on the soaked
    blankets, caressing, kissing. After getting her breath back she straddled me, wet bush
    tickling my stomach. &quot;Tell you something?&quot; She said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes, Kate?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;We're moving.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh. Where?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Two blocks from you. This
    autumn we'll be schoolmates!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With that, she lifted her butt,
    looked down on herself, and peed all over me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
