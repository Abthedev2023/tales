    <br>
    <br>
    As an attempt to thank you for all the stories I've enjoyed at your site - here is an
    offering. It's not all true. There are in total 19 episodes and some are written by me
    (Robert), some by me and May, and some only by May. Here's episode 1:<br>
    <br>
    While cruising around the canals of England I stopped for the night in rural Warwickshire
    and wandered back along the towpath for a mile or so to an eighteenth century pub for a
    pint or two. On the way back the urge to pee arrived which is never a problem either in
    the country or on a boat, there's hardly ever anyone around. Being a half decent sort of
    chap I hopped over a gate into a field of sheep and had just opened up when a voice
    shouted, &quot;There he is.&quot; I closed down, zipped up and saw two strapping girls
    coming through the hedge to my left, which separated the sheep from the next field.<br>
    <br>
    The girls were angry but as I had no reason to be worried I waited while they jogged up to
    me. &quot;We know what you're doing,&quot; said the shorter of them (sharp face, yellow
    sleeveless vest, businesslike blue jeans, and about my height). Her associate was bigger
    than me, blindingly beautiful with the most gloriously shining head of deep copper colored
    hair, she wore a checkered shirt, very brief hiking shorts, and woolly socks with hiking
    boots. She grabbed my wrist and said to her friend &quot;Get his other arm.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I said mildly: &quot;What's the problem?&quot; After all when does a middle-aged bachelor
    have any dealings with lovely young women in the middle of nowhere?<br>
    <br>
    They refused to reply but dragged me back through the stile in the hedge they had just
    burst out of. In this neighboring field was a cluster of tents to which I was led.
    &quot;We've got him,&quot; shouted the &quot;arresting officer&quot; as I shall call the
    copper haired beauty. Her sharp friend said to three more girls who came out of the nearer
    tent. &quot;We caught him with his thing out looking through the hedge near where you saw
    him earlier.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    This was beginning to be serious. It's amazing how people look less attractive when they
    dislike you. On a more auspicious occasion I'd have seen these as pretty girls but the
    suspicious glares and, from one in a short loose skirt, definite fear, made them seem hard
    on the eye.<br>
    <br>
    Of the other two, one was chubby and stood back. The third was small and seemed younger
    but she, slight and pale, came right up to me while I was still held and looked closely.
    The group appeared to be between 16 and 20 so I could theoretically have been father to
    them. In my mind's eye was a newspaper headline 'Pervert caught.'<br>
    <br>
    The &quot;arresting officer&quot; said to the frightened one in a loose skirt: &quot;Is
    this the one you saw?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She replied: &quot;I only saw his bald head.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I've got one of those. Already surrounded by five girls, two more came from the further of
    the tents. One of these was obviously much more angry than any of the rest. Her chest
    heaved as she clenched her fists. In an effort to look away from her infuriated gaze I
    made the mistake of dropping my eyes to her cleavage, visible in an &quot;I like it
    hot&quot; T-shirt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;People like you should be kept in cages, look he's caught in the act and still he's
    gawping at my boobs.&quot; The last of this group of seven campers had immaculate blonde
    hair to her shoulders, a bold stare and the rest of her in skintight shirt and jeans.
    Perhaps she was a pound or two beyond recommended weight but nevertheless a beauty and as
    it turned out, from America. &quot;You get a buzz off a young girls tits, hey? Guy comes
    snooping round making a girl piss herself he deserves all that's coming to him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    They all looked at 'loose skirt' and 'chubby' put an arm round her.<br>
    <br>
    I worked out what must have happened. Someone with a baldhead had surprised 'loose skirt'
    and made her piss herself.<br>
    <br>
    'Sharp' jerked my arm and said to the 'arresting officer': &quot;Lets peg him down and
    decide what to do with him.&quot; 'Cleavage' suggested castration and 'America' said,
    &quot;Phone the cops.&quot; I was terrified, who would ever believe I was an innocent
    party.<br>
    <br>
    All this had happened within a few minutes and I'd had no chance to put my case and they
    didn't seem in the mood to listen. When I said I only nipped in the field for a pee behind
    the hedge, 'Cleavage' said sarcastically: &quot;Like a bit of wet sex then?&quot; I made
    another mistake and replied &quot;Nice if you can get it&quot; thinking that a small joke
    might lighten the atmosphere.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Peg him out,&quot; said 'Sharp'. And they did.<br>
    <br>
    I realized that if I struggled someone would get hurt and even if I escaped I'd have
    little chance of outrunning them and I'd be trapped at the boat which was only a few
    hundred yards away. The arresting officer and Sharp dropped me to the ground while
    Cleavage drove a pair of croquet-hoop tent pegs over my ankles and America did the same to
    my wrists. The task was completed with ropes from wrist and ankle to a further pair of
    pegs some distance away. I was between the two main tents and behind a third, which
    appeared to be for a toilet. Lying there wanting to piss, in mortal danger of arrest as a
    pervert I wondered how a pleasant June evening could have gone so wrong.<br>
    <br>
    The girls retired to their campfire at the other side of the toilet tent. Their
    discussions were inaudible till Cleavage said loudly: &quot;I'm going to piss on him, not
    in the tent.&quot; She appeared with Sharp and the arresting officer who stood on my
    wrists, she straddled my waist dropped her jeans and panties (slightly yellow) and peed
    over me whilst staring me in the eye. This time I had no choice but to look down her
    salient feature. Still hoping to extricate myself I said: &quot;This could be a
    mistake.&quot; The words were all right but as she stood up it was clear my cock was
    letting me down by trying to stand up. She was not amused.<br>
    <br>
    There followed what should have been a watersports enthusiast's delight. Sharp did exactly
    the same as Cleavage but facing my feet. &quot;Get your jollies did you?&quot; Sodden and,
    I confess it, embarrassed, I made no reply. Next came America who chose my neck and face
    while the arresting officer ensured that I was wet from head to crotch. Any peeping tom
    would have enjoyed all this immensely. Lastly Chubby and 'slight and pale' squatted above
    each leg. Loose skirt wouldn't come near.<br>
    <br>
    By now it was dark and much cooler. They returned to their fire and I took the opportunity
    to warm myself with a strong pee. A noise round the fire drew my attention, someone was
    coming, Loose skirt and Chubby. Although I couldn't distinguish the words it seemed that
    Loose skirt had to pee but was still too frightened to come anywhere near me on her own.
    The back of the toilet tent was less than two yards from me as I lay looking up at the
    stars and still dreading the arrival of a police car.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is him, he's there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Who?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There by the stile.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is not.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is, I can see his beard.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    That's what I heard. Then there was a rushing and commotion, girls running to and from,
    shouting, the sound of someone crashing about in the bushes, a scream from a male voice
    then more sounds of running off into the distance. Lastly I heard the noise of a car
    engine and someone driving furiously on a bumpy track.<br>
    <br>
    'Slight and pale' carried a pair of binoculars, the others were out of breath describing
    how the man with a goatee beard had crashed through the thorn hedge and run off leaving
    the binoculars caught in the bush. The girls came back to the fire and there was a hurried
    conversation getting louder as the group moved closer to where I was.<br>
    <br>
    Sharp spoke first: &quot;we are in trouble; you're not the man. We thought you were the
    peeping tom.&quot; The arresting officer was clearly very upset, she heaved the pegs out
    of the ground as if she were Hercules himself. Untying the ropes she said: &quot;we have
    got to put this right somehow. You could have us all arrested for what we did to you. We
    are very sorry.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Cleavage was as good as she had been bad. She helped me stand up put her arm round me
    saying: &quot;Look at the poor soul whatever must he think of us. I was seething for what
    happened to Rissa (Loose skirt) and now we've just got to ask for mercy.&quot; 'Slight and
    pale' suggested that they should wash out my clothes while I warmed up by the fire.<br>
    <br>
    The changed expressions turned them from harridans to young girls in a pickle. My turn to
    speak: &quot;Did you call for the police?&quot; The relief when they said no, made me feel
    magnanimous since there was no hope of making any sense with the police. I accepted the
    offer of washed clothes, a cup of tea, a plate of risotto, a blanket and a chat by the
    fire. It was delightful to find that neither they nor I was in the least embarrassed as
    they undressed me. I was amused to find that they felt I was incapable of undressing
    myself. After all they had shown me their inner secrets and now they were determined to be
    kind and, truth to tell, they were really very nice. They'd been at a secretarial college
    and had come that day on a camping weekend to celebrate the end of their exams.<br>
    <br>
    My guesses at their ages had been wrong; all were between 20 and 27. Janice (the arresting
    officer) was married. Rissa (loose skirt) was engaged to a football player who thought she
    was upper class because she was called Clarissa. America (Janey) was with the USAF. After
    an hour or so the atmosphere relaxed enough for us to chat quite happily though I still
    felt a bit shaken. Chubby (May), whose full name I can't give, took an especial shine to
    me and was the eldest at 27 and confided to me that when I said &quot;wet sex is
    nice&quot; started to see me in a different light. She told me confidentially that it was
    one of her 'little twists'. We spent the rest of the hour till midnight swapping
    intimacies though I'm nearly twice her age.<br>
    <br>
    When the clothes were warm and dry May took me by the hand and told the rest that she
    would be back in the morning. I opened my mouth to comment that I didn't know where she
    would sleep but having put my foot in it already that night I remained silent.<br>
    <br>
    Back at the boat she made more tea, tested the bunk then asked if there was a toilet on
    board and on being told you had to go out on deck to reach it she smiled and said:
    &quot;Oh well we shan't need it shall we? I'll hold out till the morning.&quot; She
    finished her tea, took a full glass of water then said sweetly &quot;Shall we cuddle up
    and you can try to forgive us all?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She didn't manage to hold out all night but as far as I could tell slept soundly. In the
    morning she opened sleepy smiling eyes pulled me closer and asked what time it was. Not
    knowing I said, &quot;Breakfast time.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She smiled more broadly saying: &quot;Tea in bed?&quot; I mumbled Yes thinking perhaps she
    really is a kindly girl and not just trying to make sure I don't cause trouble over the
    evening's exploits by offering her body. We hadn't yet done more than explore each other
    thoroughly.<br>
    <br>
    She rolled on top of me, as I thought preparing to get out on my side, but she remained on
    top facing me and grinned again saying: &quot;Sure you like wet sex?&quot; I knew what
    would happen next so I said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and she did. A hiss and a sigh and a smile
    like the Cheshire cat she kissed me wetly and said &quot;Tea in bed.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The boat and I stayed there till the weekend was over. It turned out she had read the
    Allday Girls so we played 'Hold it' from Sunday at 8.00 till 2 in the afternoon when I
    lost but she couldn't make the last twenty minutes. Then we had dinner round the campfire
    and went for a long walk with Rissa and Janey who were also into watersports. Imagine
    trying to walk 7 miles along the canal bank carrying 3 pints inside. Rissa was so happy
    that she won- only giving way as she climbed the gate into the field. Wet and happy we
    said goodnight there and May taught me a new game.<br>
    <br>
    We sat either side of my dining table with a pack of cards. Whoever turned over a Jack
    (Knave) first had to drink a mug of warm water. The next Jack, it was two mugs, the third
    it was three. All of these fell to me, and then the fourth to May who had to down four
    (two pints, 45 fluid oz.). Then we had to shuffle, change places to shake it all down and
    start again. This time round, it was one mug per Jack after which there was a half hour
    break with no release allowed. During that time we talked about how there are two parts to
    the hold it game. The easy one is the aching bladder, its just a dull pain that gets
    stronger but then there is the tingling, twitching right at the opening, the cock end, the
    pee hole, with its constant message &quot;Pee now.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Every effort to clench the opening sends another twitch saying &quot;Pee NOW.&quot; May
    had found that an absorbent pad and plastic pants allowed her to relax the mental pressure
    and slightly reduce the frequency and urgency of the messages shuddering the length of her
    body. Neither of us was equipped that evening so we wriggled and fidgeted and giggled.<br>
    <br>
    The third round was wicked. As we turned the cards alternately there was the anticipation
    of relief since this time turning a Jack meant we could fill a mug and the other had to
    drink it. Fine, but you had to stop the flow and regain control. By this time I had only a
    single mug disadvantage since May had lost three of the previous four. In the 'You drink
    mine' she had to take the first two of mine. She wasn't just desperate she was squeaking,
    unable to breath steadily and quivering like a nudist on a winter's day. I didn't tell her
    at the time but it impressed me that she could still hold on. She sat there in a T-shirt
    with bunny rabbits and soft pink cotton panties barely covered by a short flared skirt.
    Waves of 'PEE NOW' came every 10 seconds with only a moment's ease between each one. She
    held with one hand and turned with the other giggling like an idiot trying to say she was
    a feminist and didn't give in to men. I thought I was on a winner but the last two of hers
    were mine.<br>
    <br>
    The last round should not have started for another half hour but we mutually agreed it
    would never happen unless we reduced the waiting time to 15 minutes. This time whoever
    picked the first Jack came to sit on the other's lap the second Jack had to drink a mug of
    water, the third could try to pee a mug full and pass it for the other to drink the fourth
    could let go.<br>
    <br>
    It went like this. May turned the first and came to sit on me. She had several attempts to
    do this but opening her legs to straddle (it had to be face to face) proved nearly
    impossible without letting go. Her will power triumphed but turning to reach the pack of
    cards was excruciating as we were both shaking so much. The second was mine. She produced
    the third and after a hilarious and almost fatal argument insisted that she would not move
    off my lap and I had to hold the mug and funnel. That bit was messy since she hadn't
    gauged when to shut off. My sawn-off jeans got wet and I squirted involuntarily but she
    didn't notice.<br>
    <br>
    Knowing the end was only seconds away I downed the lot. Turning each card was becoming
    ludicrous as neither of us could reach the pack without spurting. The pressure on my
    stomach was awesome whenever she wiggled which was continuous. It was my turn to pick a
    card. I clamped every muscle shut and lunged hoping it was the last Jack as I had little
    chance of holding while she turned to the table. The winner had to show a dry pair of
    undies. Neither of us could have done that already. In the event it didn't matter. As I
    made my lunge May giggled again, wobbled on my lap, cried oh and lost it copiously, into
    her knickers and all over me and the chair and the floor. Whether she burst before me I
    can't tell because before I slumped back into the chair I'd lost it too. We gave up
    holding ourselves and held each other pissing like donkeys and laughing with abandon. It
    seemed like ages we held on to one another panting and sobbing, tears ran down our faces
    and rivers down our legs, hot and steaming it pooled on the floor and trickled through the
    deck boards into the bilges.<br>
    <br>
    It was 9pm and the game had taken almost two hours. We sat there exhausted looking closely
    at each other unable to speak for a while. The moment passed and we came back to reality.
    May gazed around at the mess and said simply 'Gosh'. Being older and supposedly more
    sensible I smiled at her and said: 'What have we done?' She hung her arms round my neck
    and said: &quot;We've still got the final act to complete, shall we go to bed and have a
    nice cup of Tea?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Strangely the final act wasn't what we both expected. Instead of leaping for the bunk we
    stood holding in a close embrace and dripped for a few minutes feeling our whole bodies
    sensitive to the slightest movement. May shuddered once moaning, then again, and again
    pushing against me each time. Her eyes had a faraway look as my cock grew and grew. She
    leaned back and gently said: &quot;Let's clean up first or it'll stink in the
    morning.&quot; My heart sank; surely she wasn't going back to her tent.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aren't you stopping?&quot; I asked.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Course I am, silly, how could I go back like this? You clear up and I'll make the
    tea.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mopping and rinsing took longer than the tea. Two bare and randy people slid into a warm
    dry bed with comforting cups of tea. A few minutes chatting and we were ready to let our
    bodies have what they wanted. We'd put our cups aside and taken hold, quivering but still
    holding back when May said: &quot;I'm going to have to pee first.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What!&quot; I said. &quot;Go outside or pee in the bed like last night.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't leave you with a wet mattress again, just see that
    there's no one on the towpath and I'll pee like a proper little lady.&quot; Plump she
    might be but she was beautiful there in the moonlight, bare as the day she was born. A
    warm sultry breeze wafted around us while we held our excited bodies together. It began to
    rain as heavy cloud drifted over. Before we had accomplished the final pee, it was falling
    in stairods (an old-fashioned expression) and we staggered laughing back into the cabin.<br>
    <br>
    Lying there wrapped round a lovely woman listening to the hammering of a deluge on the
    metal roof I knew there wouldn't be another moment like it in my life. May whispered:
    &quot;I wish I was old enough to propose to you&quot; and I knew then that she had never
    had a boyfriend. I couldn't say a word; the events of the weekend had been so far out of
    my own placid life's normal routine that I would have wept. We held on so tightly moving
    slightly so that every nerve called out and the thunder surrounded us. Did we fall asleep
    or pass out? I don't know but in the morning the mattress was more or less dry but we were
    both very sticky. May sat up running her hands over her breasts. &quot;I want to do it
    this weekend again,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Where do you live?&quot; I told her and we
    did.<br>
    <br>
    How much of it is true? I'm not telling but try the game with a friend.<br>
