    Female Desperation, Accidental Wetting and Humiliation.</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In the last episode of Nancy's experiences we saw her in a very embarrassing situation on
    a city bus where her bladder released accidentally flooding her clothes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was experiencing a public wetting humiliation
    to the nth degree only to awaken to a wet bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy's
    wetting accident on the city bus was merely a dream, a dream that coincided with her
    wetting her bed after a night of beer drinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But,
    the dream that seemed so real was not too far removed from some of Nancy's real
    experiences.<o:p></o:p></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You see, Nancy had more than a few
    public-wetting accidents in her twenty-two years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
    dream, referred to above, was indeed based upon similar incidents although it wasn't real
    itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a youngster when playing with
    friends she would always wait till the last minute before finding a bathroom often losing
    control at the bathroom door and spending her day trying to avoid the jeers of her
    friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You would think that the discomfort
    of spending hours in wet jeans and the jeering of her peers would teach Nancy a lesson but
    she was stubborn if nothing else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
    always convinced that she was in complete control and that going to the bathroom was to be
    accomplished with the utmost discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This brings us to an incident the
    twenty two year old Nancy experienced with her boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon on the way
    home from a picnic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They had gone to an
    overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway and devoured Nancy's fried chicken and potato salad.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce had brought drinks and the condiments.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a feast that far exceeded that needed by
    two people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, it was a very hot day and
    drinks were copiously consumed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
    Bruce relieved himself several times that day, Nancy preferred to remain aloof of such a
    vulgar act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they packed the car and
    drove off to go home Nancy was becoming a bit distressed with a full bladder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sitting still in the car revealed
    that it was more than a bit distressed. Nancy was by this time desperate to relieve
    herself and they were an hour or more from home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most
    of that hour would be spent driving thru the forest on the Parkway.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy absolutely refused to pee in the woods so
    she kept her distress to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
    sure she could make it home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Within minutes the inability to move
    about made her situation even more desperate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    was wearing forest green culottes with a white blouse and she had brought a lemon colored
    sweater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pantyhose and loafers rounded out
    her outfit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the waves of pressure from her
    bladder assaulted her sphincter muscle she pulled at and straightened the legs of her
    divided skirt just to giver her an excuse to move about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She turned often to look out the back window commenting occasionally on what
    she saw as if her actions had a purpose other than just fidgeting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In fifteen minutes they would be off
    the Parkway and she could discreetly find an excuse to get Bruce to stop at a restroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, she was beside herself to come up with an
    excuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By now she was crossing and
    uncrossing her legs frequently and after each move smoothing out the legs of her divided
    skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A couple of times she pulled her feet
    up into the seat with her knees tucked under her chin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>All of these moves helped for a few seconds but had no lasting effect
    whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She definitely had to pee and it
    was obvious she could not make it home or very much farther for that matter.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to put her hand into her crotch and
    hold herself but she didn't want Bruce to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    sprung up into her seat and leaned over the seat back and grabbed her sweater from the
    back seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Straightening the legs of her
    skirt once again she neatly folded the sweater and placed it onto her lap.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of this movement provided her a measure of
    relief for a time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She slid her right hand under the
    sweater and into her crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she crossed
    her left leg over her hand and her right leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
    could not possibly know of her distress and already she was becoming more comfortable with
    her new holding routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the pressure
    was unrelenting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was now not only holding
    herself but also massaging herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    could not think of a single place with a restroom that would be open on this Sunday
    afternoon. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Her situation had rapidly
    deteriorated into complete desperation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Pull over,&quot; she said.
    &quot;I need to walk around.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Why do you need to walk?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Just pull over, stop the car,
    and let me out.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Dear God, I need
    to walk.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce replied, &quot;You don't need
    to walk, you need to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm trying to get
    you someplace as fast as I can.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was on the verge of tears,
    &quot;Just let me out, I've got to get out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bruce pulled over onto the shoulder
    of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Nancy uncrossed her legs a
    long spurt of pee escaped her sphincter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another
    spurt escaped as she swung her legs out the door and another as she stood up.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked down and saw that the center pleats of
    her culottes were covering her accident so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    took a few mincing steps to the rear of the car and all of a sudden bent over and crossed
    her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the last straw.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although her legs were crossed tightly her pee
    flowed with abandon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was peeing unabashedly.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It flooded the legs of her culottes soaking far
    beyond what the pleats would cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
    once again humiliating herself in public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    time even in front of her boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    glanced at a few cars as they passed and noted that the occupants were looking at her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She realized that her posture was such as to
    telegraph what she was doing even if no one could actually see her wet skirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The relief from the distended
    bladder was exhilarating but the fact that she had wet herself like a child was
    humiliating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to face Bruce and she
    couldn't possibly conceal what she had done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyway,
    he seemed to know that she was in distress. This might well be the last of Bruce.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was still holding her sweater and it dangled
    in front of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, she could see that it
    wouldn't cover the evidence of her accident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She stood waiting for the dripping
    to stop when she heard the car door open. Bruce opened the trunk and retrieved an
    oversized beach towel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He handed it to her
    and said: &quot;Wrap yourself in this making sure it is under you before you sit in the
    car.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked at him in shock as if
    he were her father scolding her as had been done on several occasions.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Bruce put his arm around her and said to come
    along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's all right.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll get you home without anyone knowing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be our secret.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In gratitude to Bruce's sensitivity and in
    humiliation for what she had done Nancy spent most of the trip home trying not to bawl her
    eyes out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She slid her soaked self into the
    seat and started once again to arrange the legs of her skirt feeling the wetness and
    thoroughly embarrassed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked over at
    Bruce and noted that he was severely aroused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
    muttered: &quot;Your place or mine?&quot; just in time to keep her from bawling her eyes
    out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
