    <br>
    Cindy quietly cursed each cup of coffee she had drunk on that cool, busy morning. It was
    almost 9 a.m. and the parade was about to begin. Her uncomfortably full bladder worried
    her. Could she hold on for the hour or more the parade would take before ending at a
    shopping center 2 miles away? <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Damn, damn, damn,&quot; she said under her breath while pressing her thighs
    together. &quot;And I don't even like coffee,&quot; she said ruefully.<br>
    <br>
    The morning had not gone well. She had awakened at 5 a.m. with just four hours sleep after
    partying with friends the night before. She had a slight hangover and immediately gulped
    down a cup of coffee to get herself going. She'd had another cup in the car on the drive
    to the parade assembly area, where she had to get into her costume, get made up and be
    placed aboard the float.<br>
    <br>
    Cindy had taken a pee shortly after she arrived at the assembly area, but had consumed
    more cups of coffee - she didn't keep track of how much - trying to wake up and stay warm
    in the cool early morning air. The float crew helped her get into in her fairy godmother
    outfit. It was a frilly floor-length silver gown, with lots of crinoline petticoats that
    made it flow out all around her some 30 inches from her feet. Her make up was applied; she
    got her magic wand and tiara, then headed for the float.<br>
    <br>
    Cindy had felt a need to pee again before getting aboard the float, but there was a
    problem. There were plenty of portable toilets scattered around the assembly area, but for
    the life of her, Cindy could not figure out how she could get into one of them, wearing
    that massive gown; and if she could manage to squeeze inside and close the door, then
    what? How would she get all that cloth, with its hoops and petticoats, out of the way so
    she could take a pee? There was just no way. She decided she didn't have to go that bad
    and would wait.<br>
    <br>
    Next there was the float itself. Cindy, as the fairy godmother, was expected to stand atop
    a 10-foot high castle made of plywood, chicken wire, crepe paper and flowers. To get up
    there, one of the rolling metal steps used in warehouse-type stores to get merchandise
    down from upper shelves was wheeled up next to the float. Cindy went up the steps and
    clambered atop the castle, where there was about 3 square feet of plywood platform to
    stand on and a waist high brass railing for her to hold so she wouldn't fall off the
    float. Once atop the castle, there was no way down until the end of the parade, when a
    similar set of steps would be available.<br>
    <br>
    So here she was, trying not to think about her condition while the bands struck up their
    music and the long line of marchers and vehicles and floats starting to move down the
    street. Cindy, who hoped to become a professional model, was proud of was her ability to
    project a positive happy image no matter how she felt. She'd been queen of homecoming and
    the senior prom, plus Miss Tomato Queen and runner-up in a local beauty contest. She
    smiled, waved her wand and tried to present an image of a wise, beautiful fairy godmother,
    despite the pressure mounting in her crotch and the desperation building in her bladder. <br>
    <br>
    The parade moved at snail's pace, starting and stopping and bumping along. Every change,
    every bump, every lurch increased Cindy's desperation. After 30 minutes, the float
    approached the reviewing stand, where various politicians, dignitaries and VIPs were
    seated. The TV cameras were also there. It another minute it would be show time. Then,
    just seconds away from the reviewing stands, Cindy felt a spasm of pain and a warm flow
    surged into her panties. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh, no, no, not now!&quot; she said to herself.<br>
    <br>
    She squeezed her thighs together forcefully and the warmth ceased to expand. She had it
    under control. She was waved the magic wand and smiled at the dignitaries and TV cameras.
    The crowd cheered and she blew them kisses. And at that moment she felt a new surge of wet
    warmth flood her panties and start down her thighs. She squeezed her thighs again, but to
    no avail. Hot and wet and pungent, the pee flowed in uncontrollable waves, soaking her
    panties and panty hose, pouring down her legs and, within seconds, flooding her shoes. As
    the pee flooded down her legs, emotions overwhelmed Cindy's senses.<br>
    <br>
    First, there was the panic at losing control, at embarrassing herself in front of
    thousands. But that was mitigated by her confidence that she was a professional, and that
    she could and would smile and wave and carry on as if nothing was happening. Plus there
    was that raw sense of relief as the pain of an overfilled bladder dissipated. The
    increasingly painful pressure was gone. No matter how awkward and how embarrassing, her
    body felt relief. And finally, she felt a strange pleasure, an emotion that surprised her.
    The warm wetness actually felt good as it spread through her crotch, down her legs and
    around her feet. Best of all, the long gown hid everything. There was a subtle sexuality
    to it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Omigod, I'm peeing my pants in front of thousands, and no one knows,&quot; she
    thought to herself. It was a sweet secret and she found herself slightly aroused by the
    emotion.<br>
    <br>
    The float moved on and soon the reviewing stand was well behind them. It was still another
    30 minutes until they reached the end of the parade route, but Cindy felt comfortable,
    even happy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This fairy godmother has some magic yet,&quot; she said to herself as she gave the
    crowd an extra big smile.<br>
    <br>
    Finally the float rolled into the parking lot where parade was breaking up. Marchers and
    float riders and drivers and children of all ages were flocking to the portable toilets
    set up around parking lot. Cindy wondered whether others had wet themselves. Her bladder
    had filled again as the coffee continued to percolate through her system. But she was OK.
    She could wait. Her revelry was broken by the voice of the parade master.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cindy, we've got a problem,&quot; he said. &quot;Someone forgot to bring the
    stairway here. We have no way to get you down. I've sent Jim to get a ladder. He'll be
    back in 10 minutes or so. Can you wait?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll be fine,&quot; Cindy replied, although in truth she was starting to feel
    uncomfortable. But this time it was different. She had a secret and it gave her great
    pleasure. After 10 minutes of waiting, when the stairway had not appeared, she relaxed and
    let the hot pee flood out of her. It warmed her again as it flowed through her panties and
    down her legs and into her shoes. The sensation once again aroused her, this time not so
    subtly. <br>
