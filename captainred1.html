      <P class="storyteller">Rescue At Sea</P>
      <P> As he piloted his small cabin cruiser along the edge of the Gulf Stream, 
        Jim Maxwell noticed a stationary blip on the radar. That was not all that 
        unusual, probably a fisherman. But as he got within sight of the object, 
        he<BR>
        noted that it was not one but two boats, one a large sport fisherman, 
        the other a &#147;Cigarette&#148; type speedboat. It was unusual to see 
        boats nested like that in the open sea, so Maxwell decided to have a closer 
        look. <BR>
        <BR>
        When he focused his binoculars on the boats, his blood ran cold. Two men 
        on the after deck of the sport fisherman were taunting a woman, pushing 
        her back and forth between them, taking turns roughly kissing and pawing 
        her. He quickly rigged his sea anchor and launched his Zodiac, strapping 
        his pistol on before starting the engine. Approaching the boats, he swung 
        around to the bow of the larger boat so its superstructure would screen 
        his approach.<BR>
        <BR>
        Quietly, he lashed his inflatable to the speedboat and crept aboard. He 
        could hear them. The woman was pleading to be left alone, the men laughing 
        and encouraging each other to continue fondling and taunting her. <BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Please, no, stop, I have to pee!&#148;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Oh, ho, yes, tickle her!&#148;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;No, please, don&#146;t . . . &#147;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;That&#146;s right, DON&#146;T!&#148; Maxwell appeared on the deck 
        of the speedboat, pistol drawn. The tormentors turned in surprise, the 
        woman stumbled to the corner of the deck and cowered in fear, her hands 
        clasped between her <BR>
        legs.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Hey, look, man, we were just having . . . &#147;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;SHUT UP!&#148; Maxwell&#146;s tone made it clear he saw no humor 
        in the situation. &#147;Sit in the fighting chairs, NOW!&#148; The men 
        hurriedly sat in the swivel chairs. &#147;Put your hands behind your backs! 
        Miss, can you tie a rope around<BR>
        their wrists?&#148; The woman nodded and crept to the mooring line coiled 
        on the deck. She was apparently a good sailor, because she threw lashings 
        around the men&#146;s wrists in short order. Holstering his pistol, Maxwell 
        then <BR>
        did the same with their ankles, lashing them to the footboards. Fastening 
        the seat belts around their waists completed the process.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Now we&#146;ll call the Coast Guard and you guys will suffer the 
        consequences of your actions!&#148; But as he headed for the cabin to 
        switch on the radio, the woman stopped him and whispered that her boat 
        was unregistered. If the Coast Guard found her she would be in trouble. 
        He considered the situation, then came up with a plan, whispering to her 
        to follow his lead. Proceeding to the cabin, he pretended to make the 
        radio call, then returned to the deck with the woman, who seemed to have 
        forgotten her need to pee. He asked her name and what had happened.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;My name&#146;s Elena. I was just cruising out here when these two 
        sent up a flare, a distress signal. When I came alongside to see what 
        the trouble was, they grabbed me and started pawing and pushing me. They 
        said they<BR>
        would . . . enjoy me soon!&#148; <BR>
        <BR>
        Maxwell nodded. &#147;Well, no reason not to be comfortable while we wait. 
        See if there&#146;s any beer in the galley fridge.&#148; There was, and 
        Jim carefully untied on of each man&#146;s hands so they could drink. 
        He drank along with<BR>
        them, but made it look like he was drinking a lot more than he actually 
        was. After the two had consumed four cans, one of them said he had to 
        pee.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Well,&#148; Jim said, &#147;Let&#146;s see about that.&#148; With 
        a deft move, he swept the man&#146;s hand behind his back and re-tied 
        it, repeating the process with his partner. Turning the two seats back 
        to back, he put a piece of tape over each man&#146;s mouth. He then lowered 
        the one man&#146;s zipper and extracted his penis, then whipped a short 
        length of fishing line from his pocket, looped it around just below the 
        crown, pulled it snug, and tied a fisherman&#146;s <BR>
        knot in it. He repeated the process with the other, then swung them around 
        to face each other.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Know what happens when you&#146;re tied tight with fishing line 
        like that? The flesh swells.&#148; He took a pair of clippers and cut 
        the ends of the line close to the knots. If you survive and are found, 
        the only way they&#146;ll get<BR>
        that off is to cut your dicks to get at it. And you may have gangrene 
        in the ends by then, who knows? The only treatment for gangrene is . . 
        . amputation!&#148; He snapped the clippers together. &#147;Not only that, 
        but the backup will probably cause kidney damage. You&#146;ll have to 
        spend the rest of your lives using kidney machines! That is, if you&#146;re 
        found. We faked the distress call.&#148; Triumphantly, he replaced their 
        already-distended penes in their pants and zipped them up, then removed 
        the tape from their mouths.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Go ahead and scream. No one will hear you except us, and we&#146;ll 
        be gone before long. And screaming will make you thirsty!&#148; He held 
        up a half-full beer can. &#147;You&#146;ll be dying of too little fluid 
        in one end, and too much in<BR>
        the other!&#148; He drank off the beer and then laughed. &#147;You know, 
        I have to pee now. Care to watch?&#148; Oblivious to the whining pleas 
        of his victims, he lowered his own zipper and stepped to the rail, aiming 
        at the deck between<BR>
        them. As he peed, Elena clapped her hand to her groin, pressing her lips 
        and knees together as she watched.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;I almost forgot,&#148; she said as Jim zipped up, &#147;I still 
        have to pee, and you wouldn&#146;t let me then!&#148; She stepped out 
        of her shorts and panties and stood, feet apart, hands on hips, and relaxed 
        her groin muscles. Howls of anguish<BR>
        accompanied her sigh of relief as a golden stream jetted from her pussy, 
        splattering on the deck between the fighting chairs. She picked up her 
        discarded clothes and stepped over the rail to her boat. Jim untied the 
        mooring lines and pushed the boats apart as Elena, not bothering to put 
        her pants back on, started the big engines. Their rumble drowned out the 
        keening of the would-be rapists as he stepped up behind her, standing 
        <BR>
        at the boat&#146;s controls, and put his hands on her hips.. <BR>
        <BR>
        Glancing over her shoulder at him with a naughty grin, she murmured, &#147;And 
        what do you think you&#146;re doing back there?&#148;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Ummm, protecting you from the elements?&#148;<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;You&#146;ve already protected me from the worst elements.&#148; 
        As she said this, she rolled her hips back to press her bare bottom against 
        Jim&#146;s front. He pressed against her in response, one of his hands 
        sliding under her halter<BR>
        top to cup a breast. &#147;Mmmm, yes, that&#146;s good.&#148; He kissed 
        her neck and shoulders as he fondled her taut nipple with one hand and 
        curled his other around her hip to cup her pussy, the downy hairs still 
        damp from her pee. <BR>
        Through this she kept her hands on the steering wheel, but then she slid 
        one behind her to fumble with Jim&#146;s zipper. His shorts fell to the 
        deck and his hot penis nestled between the cheeks of Elena&#146;s tush 
        like a sausage in a bun.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Wait!&#148; Jim felt her tense up and stepped back, breaking contact.. 
        &#147;I have an idea, another way to punish those creeps!&#148; Jim raised 
        an eyebrow. &#147;They were gonna rape me. I want them to see what I do 
        with someone I like! <BR>
        And to see what they&#146;ll never get!&#148; Deftly, she manipulated 
        the wheel and throttles until the speedboat was idling astern of the sport 
        fisherman, not ten feet away from it. She pulled the top over her head 
        and stepped to <BR>
        the rail, leaning over to rest her hands on it. The two captives stared 
        at the sight. Taking his cue, Jim pulled off his own t-shirt and stepped 
        up behind her, for a moment nestling between her cheeks as before, but 
        then <BR>
        pushing his shaft down and sliding it between her parted thighs, letting 
        it press up against her twice-moist labias. Caressing her breast with 
        one hand, he held her hip with the other, guiding her in a sensual rocking 
        motion. &#147;You see what I do for those I like,&#148; she said in a 
        purring tone. &#147;Enjoy the view &#133;it&#146;s something you&#146;ll 
        never have!&#148; She reached down and pushed Jim&#146;s rod into her. 
        He reflexively pushed deep. Over her shoulder, she whispered not to be 
        gentle, but just take her. This he did, rocking his hips firmly to slide 
        his hot penis out and in, where the restrained men on the other boat could 
        clearly see.<BR>
        <BR>
        &#147;Oh, geeez, I have to pee again! I&#146;m gonna cum and go!&#148; 
        Laughing, then whimpering, she let fly just as Jim&#146;s penis began 
        to throb inside her. Her high-pitched squeals floated over the water. 
        As his orgasm abated, Jim<BR>
        grinned. The beer he had drunk was still having an effect on him, and 
        he decided to use it to effect. Easing out of her, he held his penis between 
        her legs and let fly himself, his stream jetting from between her legs 
        as if it was her own. With a girlish shriek and giggle, Elena watched, 
        once reaching her finger to intercept the golden stream as it arced over 
        the rail, making the distinctive trickling noise in the water below.<BR>
        <BR>
        He then whispered in her ear, and she nodded. Time to abandon the scene 
        of the crime! Elena strode, defiantly naked, to the controls as Jim shook 
        the last drops off his penis. He stood beside her as she put the big engines<BR>
        into gear and gunned them, splashing water over the other boat and the 
        men on its deck.</P>
