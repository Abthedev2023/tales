    <br>
    'T was the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>
    No creatures were stirring, except me and my spouse;<br>
    <br>
    Our bladders we'd been filling by the chimney without care,<br>
    In hopes that even St. Nicholas our pants could not spare;<br>
    <br>
    Then we'd nestled down all snug in our bed,<br>
    While visions of sexy accidents danced in our heads;<br>
    <br>
    And mamma in her panties and I in my cap,<br>
    Had just settled in, but for much more than a winter's nap;<br>
    <br>
    When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
    Our hands sprang to our pants stop the leaking from our bladders;<br>
    <br>
    Away to the window we flew like a flash,<br>
    And stood crossing our legs while we threw up the sash;<br>
    <br>
    The moon on my wife's breasts, which were as white as snow,<br>
    Gave the texture of steel to my object below;<br>
    <br>
    When what to my wondering eyes should appear?<br>
    But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;<br>
    <br>
    With a cute little driver so lively and quick,<br>
    I knew who it was but couldn't stop squeezing my prick;<br>
    <br>
    More rapid than eagles her coursers they came,<br>
    They'd have to hurry before our bladders ended our game.<br>
    <br>
    And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br>
    <br>
    Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>
    On, Comet! On, Cupid! On Donder and Blitzen!<br>
    <br>
    To the top of the porch! To the top of the Wall!<br>
    Now dash away! And hurry before golden drops begin to fall!<br>
    <br>
    I dared St. Nick, with no bathroom breaks this route I'd fly,<br>
    But if I can't pee soon, I think I'm going to die;<br>
    <br>
    I ate all the cookies and drank all the milk, in the morning they must be found missing,<br>
    But it was a trick by that horny old St. Nick, to come home my panties almost pissing;<br>
    <br>
    But I'm a girl who likes her fun too; I can be just as sly,<br>
    I left him with plenty to drink and a little pad lock on his fly!<br>
    <br>
    So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,<br>
    With the sleigh full of toys and a desperate Mrs. Nicholas too;<br>
    <br>
    I just ignored what I heard on the roof,<br>
    Because I couldn't keep my hands off my bursting wife Ruth;<br>
    <br>
    We managed to stop jiggling and fondling and then we turned around,<br>
    Down the chimney Mrs. Nicholas came with a bound;<br>
    <br>
    She was dressed scantily in fur from her head to her foot,<br>
    But she looked like her panties were about to be stained with more than just soot;<br>
    <br>
    A bundle of toys she had flung on her back,<br>
    But she had to pee so bad she almost couldn't open her pack.<br>
    <br>
    Her eyes - how they twinkled! Her cleavage, how large and merry!<br>
    Her cheeks were like roses but her cold nipples poked out like huge cherries!<br>
    <br>
    All our mouths were drawn up like cute little bows,<br>
    As we each danced and struggled to hold back our flows;<br>
    <br>
    As she crossed her legs tightly and gritted her teeth,<br>
    My wife and I kissed and wondered, is she still dry underneath?<br>
    <br>
    Her face was bright when she saw my wife's swollen belly,<br>
    And she knew we were planning much more fun than watching the telly;<br>
    <br>
    She was chubby and plump, and so sexy holding herself,<br>
    My wife and I started fondling each other in spite of our self;<br>
    <br>
    Naughty, naughty you two she said, I'm afraid you must think I'm a flirt,<br>
    Checking her panties both back and front, the trip down the chimney had made her squirt!<br>
    <br>
    With a wink of her eye and a twist of her head,<br>
    I knew that tonight St. Nick and I both were going to have a very wet bed;<br>
    <br>
    She spoke not another word, but went straight to her work,<br>
    And stopped only whenever an urge made her grab herself with a jerk;<br>
    <br>
    She did a wonderful dance while she filled all the stockings with care,<br>
    With peeing DVD's to watch and panties and shorts to wet on a dare;<br>
    <br>
    My wife and I were so horny that us she'd begun to watch,<br>
    Until the pressure in her bladder made her start rubbing her crotch:<br>
    <br>
    Laying a cute little hand beside her nose, (the other was still busy rubbing her
    pantyhose),<br>
    Giving her self a good squeeze, up the chimney she rose;<br>
    <br>
    She sprang to her sleigh with just a little spurt, and to her team gave a shout,<br>
    Get me home fast boys; it's all about to come out!<br>
    <br>
    Go as fast as you can, soar to new heights,<br>
    They made me need Nicholas so bad I'm creaming my tights!<br>
    <br>
    Away they all flew like the down of a thistle,<br>
    And my wife and I were back in bed faster than a missile;<br>
    <br>
    With a breast in one hand and her soft mound in my other,<br>
    We each did our pee-pee dances while desperately snuggling together;<br>
    <br>
    She was leaking and creaming in her panties, I could tell she was just about to burst,<br>
    In my own pants I was ready to explode, I didn't know if I would pee or cum first;<br>
    <br>
    It was then I heard Mrs. Claus' call home, on the wind and just by chance,<br>
    You have to hold it, Nicholas; when I get there we'll both cum and pee in my pants!<br>
    <br>
    And I heard her exclaim 'ere she drove out of sight,<br>
    &quot;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a wonderfully wet night!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Gotta pee ...<br>
    <br>
    Gotta pee ...<br>
    <br>
    Gotta pee ...<br>
    <br>
    Gotta pee-e-e-e-e ...<br>
    <br>
