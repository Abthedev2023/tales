    Desperate Boyfriend</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><font
    FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Hi, my
    name is MoonSpirit and I'm a female. <strong>This story is about male desperation</strong>
    and how I found out that I get off on seeing my boyfriend desperate. I've always had a
    thing for watching people who needed to use the bathroom, but never really realized there
    were others like me out there until I found your web site while surfing one day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Last month my boyfriend and I were driving
    into New York from New Jersey. We were meeting friends in the city at 7PM which put us at
    the Holland Tunnel in the height of rush hour traffic. Now, getting through the tunnel at
    this time in the evening usually takes about a half hour. Considering the fact that the
    drive from our home to the tunnel takes an hour, we were prepared for an hour and a half
    trip. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">As we inched our way to the tunnel I saw a
    look of pain on Chris' face. I asked him what was wrong and he said &quot;nothing&quot;. I
    thought the traffic was getting to him as he is an impatient driver. As we approached the
    toll&nbsp; booth, he was sort of bending over at the waist toward the steering wheel. He
    has a nervous stomach so I asked again if he was okay. He responded that he was just
    tired. When we finally got into the tunnel I noticed Chris tapping his hands hard on the
    steering wheel while still kind of bending forward. The traffic was moving ever so slowly.
    After a few minutes I noticed him raising one cheek of his ass, then the other. His face
    was a bit contorted. It was then that I figured he must have to pee, and pretty badly at
    that. Although we've been together for three years, Chris is a very private person and
    doesn't usually announce when he is in need of a toilet, even to me. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">After about ten minutes in the tunnel, the
    green lights all turned yellow, and then red. An announcement over the tunnel speakers
    stated that a truck was stuck in the mouth of the tunnel on the New York side. The truck
    was too tall and got stuck on its way out of the tunnel. The announcement further stated
    that they were working hard to clear the truck and traffic should be moving shortly. We
    were all advised to shut off our engines and wait. By now Chris was squirming a bit, but
    not grabbing himself. I looked down at his legs and his right foot was tapping. Then he
    began fanning his legs in and out, and tapping both feet. I was really getting turned on,
    but I felt really sorry for him at the same time and wished we'd get moving so he could
    get relief.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Soon his left leg was tapping wildly and he
    was really doubling over at the waist. I put my hand on his leg to steady it and asked
    once again if he was okay. He finally responded &quot;I have to pee so bad I could taste
    it&quot;. Because of my love for him, I felt really bad watching him suffer like that, but
    I was so turned on at the same time. I told him to hold on and that we'd be out of the
    tunnel soon. He was now bouncing up and down in the seat of the car, while beads of sweat
    formed on his brow. I could see that he was using every muscle in his body in his effort
    to hold his pee. I looked at his face and noticed that he was biting down hard on his
    lower lip. Soon, even his breathing became irregular. I began to rub his lower back,
    thinking that would make him feel better, or at least get his mind of his dire need. I was
    talking about anything and everything to keep his mind off his bladder. He was answering
    with short sentences or not at all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">We now had the engine off for about twenty
    minutes and there was no further announcement about how long it would actually take to
    clear the truck at the end of the tunnel. I noticed Chris had tears in his eyes as he
    tried hard to contain himself. I kept glancing down at his crotch, but it was dry. It was
    so weird, because I felt sorry for him still, but at the same time I knew that any minute
    he'd have to grab himself - or pee himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Finally an announcement broke the silence,
    but it wasn't the news Chris wanted to hear. &quot;We are still working on the blockage
    which should be cleared within the hour&quot;. Hearing this made Chris wince, and for the
    first time he said to me &quot;I don't think I can hold this in that long&quot;. My own
    crotch began to get damp, and I didn't even have to pee. I found myself holding my own
    sphincter tight in an effort to help him contain his flow. Being as shy as he is, I knew
    he didn't want to have to hold his dick in front of me. I wanted him to find some comfort,
    so every now and again I'd turn and look out my passenger side window. I figured this
    would give him time to give his dick a squeeze if he needed to. I was so turned on, but
    yet I felt so sorry for Chris' predicament. He finally pulled his seat back a bit and
    crossed his legs tightly. Again he commented that he had to go so bad and didn't think he
    could hold it. I kept encouraging him by telling him that he could and to think of
    something else. I knew though, that he could think of nothing else at this time except his
    dire need to pee.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Finally, after about thirty-five minutes
    the lights in the tunnel turned green and the traffic began to move forward, inch by inch.
    Chris uncrossed his legs, moved his seat back into position and began to inch along with
    the traffic. &quot;I can't do this&quot;, he exclaimed. &quot;I'm going to wet my pants, I
    need to go so bad&quot;. The traffic stopped again, briefly as cars were lead out of the
    tunnel. We were still only about mid-way through. They had a cop at the end of the tunnel
    letting about ten cars out at a time so as not to create a bottle-neck of traffic in the
    street outside the tunnel. I asked Chris if he wanted me to drive and he said &quot;yeah,
    please&quot; I maneuvered my way into the back seat and told him to scoot over to the
    passengers front seat. When he did, I climbed into the driver's seat. I glanced at Chris'
    crotch which was still dry. I was in awe of how long he was holding such a bad piss. We
    were still at a stand still when a tear fell down Chris' cheek. That was about all I could
    take. With my right hand, I grabbed his dick through his jeans, and squeezed the head
    hard. I told Chris to relax a bit. He just kept saying &quot;oh, I'm so embarrassed&quot;.
    I told him not to worry, and that it happens to the best of us. I could feel his muscles
    relax a bit as I held on to his thing. The traffic began to move, and I drove with only my
    left hand on the wheel.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Finally, we were out of the dark tunnel,
    but still crawling in traffic on the New York side. Because we were in broad daylight,
    Chris took my hand from his dick, and kind of pressed down with his own hand. At this
    point he told me he couldn't even talk, because if he did he was going to loose control.
    There are many restaurants in New York City, but trying to find a parking place is hard on
    a good day. Now, with all of these cars that just came out of the tunnel, it was near to
    impossible. New York City is not the kind of place where you can pull over and pee on the
    side of the road either. There were wall to wall people on the streets, and lots of cops
    around. I was frantically looking for a place to park so that Chris could get into a
    restaurant and finally let it out. His head was now down under the dashboard, and both of
    his arms were wrapped around his knees while his legs were drawn up to his chest. I
    reached down under his left leg and pressed hard on his dick. I felt him relax a bit at
    that point. I told him to hold it, and that I'd find parking soon. About ten minutes
    later, I found a parking spot. Getting out of the car was difficult for Chris. He couldn't
    get out right away. He said his pee was moving down his dick and if he moved his legs he'd
    loose it. I told him to take a few deep breaths and pull his muscles in tightly. I knew
    that the pee that had already escaped his bladder would have to come out, no matter how
    hard he tried to hold it. When he finally regained control, I saw a wet spot the size of a
    quarter on the left side of his zipper. I was never so horny in my life, and now I felt
    that I wanted to prolong his trip to the bathroom. Because of my feelings for him though,
    I couldn't bear to make him suffer needlessly. We walked into a steakhouse, and Chris made
    a bee-line for the men's room. By now, I had to go too, so I walked behind him to use the
    Ladies' room. Each bathroom had only one toilet, and there were three ladies in front of
    me and two men in front of Chris. Poor Chris stood there with his legs all mangled and
    crossed, while he doubled over, almost to the floor. I was telling the women in front of
    me that he'd been holding it for over an hour, and about how we were stuck in the tunnel.
    I spoke loud enough for the men in front of Chris to hear me, hoping that one of them
    would let him go in first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The men in front of Chris were not showing
    signs of desperation at all, but they still didn't allow Chris to cut the line. Finally,
    the last guy entered the bathroom. Chris was next on line for the Men's room, and I was
    next for the Ladies room. I looked at him and said &quot;it won't be long now Chris, just
    hold on&quot;. The women came out of the ladies room and it was my turn I felt guilty
    going in with Chris still trying desperately to hold it in and still waiting his turn. The
    guy in the Men's room seemed to be taking forever. I went in, peed, washed my hands, and
    came out. There was another guy waiting for the Men's room, and I could hear the sound of
    Chris' piss from outside the door. He seemed to be in the bathroom for ten whole minutes.
    When he came out he joined me at the bar. He said his stomach still hurt from his ordeal,
    but except for the tiny bit that escaped him as he got out of the car, he was basically
    dry. He'd made it. The look of relief on his face was immense. We met our friends and had
    a nice evening and an uneventful ride home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I never told Chris how turned on I was by
    him having to pee that badly. I still visualize his face in the car, holding his bladder
    for all he was worth, when we are in bed. My orgasms are stronger for it. Will I ever tell
    him it was a turn on for me? I don't think so, I don't think he'd understand.</font></p>
