    <br>
    I wrote about our last experiment. We had great success chilling her bladder with an ice
    pack. Mary was intent on holding her bursting bladder much longer...she is usually so
    strong that way. She does it for me because it's the ultimate turn on for me. However, the
    ice pack on her pelvis broke her will in less that one minute.<br>
    <br>
    So, I got to thinking about other ways to chill her. I wish we had a walk-in freezer, but
    we don't. I imagined using the freezer at the local pizza joint, but I knew the owner
    wouldn't appreciate the mess.<br>
    <br>
    I thought about waiting until the cold weather returns, but that's months away.<br>
    <br>
    All of a sudden, I knew the solution. We have a 2-quart enema bag hanging in the closet.
    We use it once a year, or so, if one of us gets &quot;stopped up&quot;. We use warm water
    to release the stoppage. I started to dream about giving Mary an ice-cold enema while she
    had a swollen, bursting bladder. I knew the cold water plus the internal pressure on her
    bladder would give her a new challenge.<br>
    <br>
    I called her at work around noon. I told her about my idea and she said &quot;no way&quot;
    and hung up on me. I called her back and said here's what I want her to do: I told her to
    avoid the toilet all afternoon. Come home with a full bladder, and we will discuss the
    enema later. She agreed.<br>
    <br>
    Around 5:15 I prepared the water. We have a large glass pitcher that we use for iced tea.
    I put two trays of ice cubes in it and filled it with cold water. It looked beautiful,
    sweating in the humidity.<br>
    <br>
    I wanted Mary to see it when she walked in. I put it on the table by the front door. Mary
    got home about 5:30. She walked in, saw the pitcher and said, &quot;Hey, we need to talk
    about this!!!!!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She said she held her pee all afternoon but wasn't interested in a cold-water enema. I
    told her that I had a new challenge that she could conquer. It would drive me crazy to see
    her chilled from the inside, struggling to hold her pee. It would be similar to the ice
    packs on the bladder!<br>
    <br>
    She said it would be unfair to introduce the pressure of an enema on her already swelling
    belly. Normally, we would use a two-quart enema when we were stopped up. There was no way
    she could take a two-quart enema with her bladder already swollen with pee.<br>
    <br>
    I told her I wanted to chill her from the inside. Two quarts of 32 degree water would
    surround her bladder and cause the greatest &quot;pee challenge&quot; she could ever
    imagine. (I thought that would be a selling point!!!!) She said: no way! She knew the
    water pressure would cause her to lose control in an instant. She didn't want to be set up
    for failure.<br>
    <br>
    So, we started talking about the chill factor. I convinced Mary that a &quot;small&quot;
    1-quart ice water enema would be a challenge and that I believe she could hold that amount
    for one minute or more before it broke her will to keep a full bladder.<br>
    <br>
    Secretly, I knew she would be in big trouble. A few years ago I had a girlfriend with a
    dynamite bladder. She always amazed me with the volume she could hold. However, she did an
    ice water enema once for me. It took about 30 seconds to give her a one-quart ice water
    enema. After receiving the 1-quart enema, she lasted 5 seconds before she gushed her pee
    on the bed. The cold water and internal pressure was too much for her.<br>
    <br>
    Mary said she thought she could handle one quart. She watched me carefully as I poured one
    quart of ice water in the enema bag. I hung the bag about 2 feet above. The filling would
    be very quick due to the 2-foot elevation.<br>
    <br>
    I put the nozzle in Mary's anus. I reminded her that she has a strong bladder and should
    hold this small one-quart enema as long as possible. I was unprepared for what happened
    next.<br>
    <br>
    I released the valve and I estimated Mary received about 16 ounces of ice water (half of
    the bag full). She yelped!!!! I never heard that sound before. She yelped in a
    high-pitched tone and said &quot;STOP I am going to lose it!!!!!!!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She immediately started to pee on the bed and also started to moan! The temperature
    difference between the enema ice water and her warm bladder made her pee seem to burn in
    her urethra. She said it made her very horny. I, of course, had a hard on waiting!<br>
    <br>
    I told her to clamp down on her pee stream as soon as she could. I guess she gushed about
    1/2 of her bladder contents before she stopped. Then we made love. I could still feel her
    swollen bladder when I entered her. She came with passion and said she liked my idea after
    all. She said we WOULD do this again! Next time, she said, knowing what to expect will
    make it easier to hold her pee longer.<br>
