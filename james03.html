    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">This accident happened last summer (July 2000) and
    is one of only three occasions that I know of when Jennifer has had an accident in the
    house.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was a Saturday morning and I was being
    lazy while Jennifer busied herself with cleaning the house. I remember looking at her as
    she wiped the windows, thinking just how lucky I was to have such a stunning wife. She
    looked a real picture, even while doing the housework, wearing a white blouse, short black
    skirt, and tanned pantyhose (tights).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">After a while she disappeared into the
    kitchen and I could hear her washing some pots. Suddenly I heard a scream from her
    direction - from the sound of it, a real scream of pain and terror signaling that
    something must be very seriously wrong; immediately I was rushing to her side to render
    aid. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Jennifer was standing by the sink with a
    real look of shock on her face, completely</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">motionless. I looked around. &quot;Are you
    ok, sweetheart, what's happened?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;I - I have... em... just, just -
    spilled some water&quot; she said very softly and in an </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">almost childlike manner as she looked down.
    &quot;A scream like that and all you did was spill some water?&quot; I shook my head,
    rather puzzled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">There was a small puddle in front of her,
    not that large, maybe 6 inches across. I really thought nothing more of it at this point.
    I watched Jennifer wipe it up before she disappeared upstairs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Ten minutes later I went upstairs to go to
    the loo. Our bedroom door was wide open and Jennifer with her back to me had obviously not
    heard me enter the room. I immediately noticed that she was no longer wearing her tights.
    She opened a drawer, took out a packet of baby wipes, and then lifted up the front of her
    skirt and used one of them to thoroughly wipe her very dense triangle, after which it was
    thrown into the bin. She then got out a pair of white cotton panties and put them on. As
    she sat down onto the bed to put on her tights she saw me so I continued on into the
    bathroom. &quot;Don't go in there!&quot; she shouted, almost falling over her tights
    trying to get to me. I saw another set of panties and pair of tights lying in the bathtub.
    &quot;Did you have an accident in the kitchen?&quot; I had to ask her. She nodded but said
    nothing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">How slow had I been, do you think - to work
    it out?</font></p>
