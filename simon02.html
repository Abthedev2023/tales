    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Birgit was starting to feel her
    bladder aching, as she tried to think of something else. She was sitting quietly in the
    middle of the boat, trying not to show her growing desperation. Birgit was part of a group
    of 3 boys and 4 girls on a boat trip to a small island in the middle of the Danube River,
    where they had visited an old castle. They had boarded the boat 3 hours ago, and since it
    was very hot, Birgit had drunk almost 2 liters of juice. Which was bad, because there had
    not been a loo on the island or on the boat. And so Birgit had been holding on since the
    urge to pee first hit her an hour ago. By now she was in great distress and having trouble
    hiding her need from the others. Not that the other girls were in a much different
    situation, Birgit noted. The boys had peed by a tree, but the girls hadn't risked that.
    Looking to her right, she could see Christine with her eyes closed and her legs pressed
    together tightly. Daniela next to her was shifting her legs constantly, and Karin was
    walking around behind them, unable to sit still. Slowly the boat was approaching land
    again, and Birgit and the others got ready to get off. In all there were about 30 people
    on the boat. When it docked, the girls quickly got off and went looking for a loo. A group
    of young girls quickly ran towards a nearby wood, and looking around Birgit spotted two
    port-a-potties by a small lake, and so they went over there, too. When they got close to
    them, they started running, and Birgit lost the race, getting there last. But as the four
    girls got closer, they saw a line of about 5 people for each of the loos. Birgit groaned
    silently, and then joined one line at the end. After about 5 minutes of waiting, there
    were still 4 people in front of Birgit, and she was near her bursting point by now. She
    was squirming around and couldn't stand still for 5 seconds. Karin, standing in line in
    front of her was in similar trouble, she was clamping her legs together and kept mumbling:
    &quot;Gotta pee so bad, I gotta go!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Daniela and Christine in the other
    line were slightly better off, but not by much. There was also no chance of getting in
    front of somebody, as standing ahead of them were the small girls from the boat, clearly
    desperate, too, and doing a pee-dance. After another 5 minutes, Birgit's bladder was
    aching so much that she thought it was going to explode. She just had to press one hand
    into her crotch not to leak, and was running on the spot frantically. Karin was almost
    doubled over, as the last girl in front of them finally went into the loo. The other line
    had made better progress, and Christine and Daniela had made it into the loo in time.
    Suddenly another urge overcame Birgit, and she threw both her hands into her crotch.
    &quot;You've gotta let me go in first&quot;, she said to Karin, &quot;I'm gonna wet
    myself!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No way! I gotta go as bad as
    you do, I can't hold on anymore!&quot; replied Karin. Suddenly Karin stopped her pee-dance
    and froze, and then she quickly clamped her tights together and hobbled to the loo,
    knocking on the door. Birgit could see a small wet spot appear on the back of her skirt,
    and felt a small squirt escape her own bladder as the loo finally opened and Karin rushed
    in. Birgit could hear a loud hissing sound when Karin let go, and it only made her
    desperation worse. She felt another longer squirt going into her panties, and just barely
    managed to stop the flow. She shouted: &quot;Let me in, I've gotta pee now!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'll be done in a
    minute,&quot; said Karin from inside the loo, and Birgit heard a loud fart from the loo.
    Oh my god, she thought, that can't be true! Just then she heard another girl from the back
    of the line moan aloud, and Birgit watched her as she ran over to a bush, piss gushing out
    from her butt. The girl squatted immediately as she reached the bush, and let go a torrent
    of piss. That was too much for Birgit. She felt another squirt escape, but this time she
    was unable to stop it. She pressed into her crotch with both hands, but for no use. She
    could feel the squirts coming faster and stronger, and finally she gave up. She hobbled to
    the back of the port-a-potty and tried to unzip her pants, but as soon as she removed one
    hand, her floodgates opened and completely soaked her jeans.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
