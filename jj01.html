    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It all started when I went to a
    concert with my big sister. She had gone to a few concerts before, and it was my first
    time, so I looked to her to know what to do and what to wear. She told me to wear a
    knee-length skirt and thick panties underneath. On top I should wear something lose, not
    tucked into my skirt. I looked trough my wardrobe and found the outfit she described. When
    the big day finally arrived we went to the concert area early so we would have a real good
    spot. My sister told me to go to the bathroom now; for we wouldn't be able to go until the
    show was over if we wanted the spot. Of course I went, and I wondered how the hell I was
    going to last for 7 hours without peeing. We were three hours early; there was a one-hour
    program before the concert would start. It would be a three hour concert, and most likely
    longer if it was a good crowd. After I finished peeing and my sister came out of her stall
    we went into the concert area and we had the best spot there was! <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the sound checks were done for
    the last time, and there was a big crowd already I told my sister I was sorry but I had to
    pee again. I had tears in my eyes when I told her I had to go and lose the spot we had. My
    sister took hold of my arm and pulled me close to her. 'Lynn, you are not going anywhere
    until the show is over. I don't want to lose this spot, and neither do you. We came here
    early to get it, and we are not going anywhere until the show is over. I have to go too,
    badly, just hold on, in ten more minutes the show will start and then it wont matter
    anymore, believe me!' I trusted my sister completely and held on. After five minutes the
    band was announced and the show started. I was really getting into the music when the
    feeling of having to go came back with a vengeance. I turned to my sister, only to find
    her dancing to the music while peeing a hard stream under her skirt. I had seen her put
    her panties on, and I couldn't imagine her taking them off on the toilet. So she must be
    wetting them. I asked her if she was wetting her panties and she told me she was, and I
    should as well. As soon as I heard she was indeed peeing her panties, my bladder gave out
    and I felt my panties getting wet. I started to dance to the music and felt real good
    about myself. It felt great to pee my panties and dance at the same time. I felt so great
    I never noticed myself stopping or starting peeing during the whole concert. After the
    concert was over we walked to the bus stop to go home and I felt my panties were very wet.
    I must have peed during the last few songs to be this wet. I saw quite a few girls in peed
    pants and even a few boys.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I started to ask where my sister got
    the idea to pee her pants at the concert. She told me she had gone to her first concert
    wearing jeans. And though she was just in time to catch the show the four hours were too
    much and she had had to leave the concert to go to the toilets, only to pee her jeans in
    line for the toilets. The next time she went she had worn a skirt and never bothered to go
    to the toilet. She peed her panties under her skirts all the time if she needed to since
    then. She even admitted to going if it wasn't all that necessary. Sometimes she would sit
    on the toilet at school peeing trough her panties, just for fun. I liked that idea very
    much and made a mental note to wear a skirt to school the next Monday.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a few weeks, where I peed my
    panties sometimes, for sheer naughtiness, I asked my sister how it felt to pee her jeans.
    I was wearing jeans as my sister was, and she said I should let the dog out with her in a
    few minutes. When we were walking the dog clouds were packing above our heads and the
    first drops started to fall. We were in the park and there was no one around. My sister
    stopped dead in her tracks and looked around. She told me the rain was going to soak us,
    so nobody would ever found out if we got home wet from more than rain alone. As soon as
    she said it she let it flow. Piss poured from her crotch, wetting her jeans all the way
    down to her shoes. Soon she was standing in a puddle of her own making while the rain was
    falling faster and faster. My sister told me I should pee myself now, or it wouldn't feel
    the same. I let go with some trouble, but it felt great. From that moment on I never took
    my raincoat to school and I didn't mind rain, as long as I got soaked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I did much more, but I'll tell that
    later.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
