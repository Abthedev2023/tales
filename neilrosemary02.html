    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Captain Holt had called over to
    Strechley Manor that morning to inspect the latest hunter that Mr. Blakley had acquired,
    and he had spent two enjoyable hours devoted to equestrian matters and drinking ale with
    Mr. Blakley and his head groom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he had
    been obliged to call into the house and pay his respects to Mrs. Blakley and her two
    daughters, discovering to his pleasure, that Florence Galworth was also present.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was given no option but to accompany these
    ladies on a drive in their new carriage, and before leaving, to sample some of Mrs.
    Blakley's tea, a drink that she specialized in providing in numerous varieties.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Holt suspected that Mrs. Blakley had hopes
    that he would be attracted to one of her daughters, but while he found these two to be
    pleasant, sociable girls, his preference was towards the older and more serious, if less
    attractive, Florence.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They had hardly been in the carriage
    more than fifteen minutes when Captain Holt began to feel a reminder of the ale he had
    consumed earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This he had to attempt to
    put out of his mind, for it was not a matter that he could deal with in present company,
    when it would be quite unthinkable to make any mention of such a personal matter.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He engaged both Florence and the Blakley sisters
    in earnest conversation about the condition of the countryside, and the welfare of the
    farm workers, hoping that a serious and intellectual discussion, while not the
    conventional fare for a carriage ride on a fine morning, would detract from the discomfort
    that he was beginning to feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Holt
    had spent most of his adult life in the Army, and was used to a life among men, where
    calls of nature were often answered openly, particularly by the lower ranks.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As an officer, Captain Holt had on occasions such
    as regimental dinners, been forced to restrain himself for long periods, and this morning
    he was preparing himself for such an ordeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Some time later, when he began to
    realize that the carriage trip was going to take longer than he had anticipated, Captain
    Holt was becoming worried about the increasingly urgent demands his body was making.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With some concern, he reviewed the quantity of
    ale and tea he had consumed since leaving his house, the last time he had had a private
    moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three, no four, glasses of ale, two
    cups of tea, and the coffee with his breakfast, were all demanding release with an ever
    increasing urgency that he could not answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    could not recall ever being in a situation like this, when he had no choice but to try to
    contain more than he might be capable of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    tried to change his position to one more comfortable in the circumstances, but it would
    have been impolite to cross his legs in the manner he most wanted, so he resorted to
    pressing his knees and thighs together as hard as he could, and leaning back on the seat.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Holt was wearing fashionably close fitting
    gray breeches, which were adding to his distress by applying pressure to his already
    aching abdomen, and he was trying to find some position where the tightness of his
    garments caused him the least discomfort.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As if these circumstances were not
    bad enough, the diverting conversation in the carriage was drying up, as Captain Holt was
    finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate on any subject, and Florence, whose
    remarks he had been most interested to hear, had also fallen almost silent.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Several times during the next half hour, Captain
    Holt suffered such crises of need that he had to lean forward and press his elbow against
    his private area, hoping that such an action was not noted by his companions, but regarded
    the alternative, a possible indiscretion in his breeches, as even worse.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he was new to the area, and unfamiliar with the
    roads about Strechley Manor, Captain Holt could not gauge how much longer their journey
    would last, though this was irrelevant, as he had no choice but to contain himself until
    they returned to the house, however long this might take.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The road they were traveling on was
    in poor condition, and every jolt of the carriage was causing a stab of pain to shoot
    through Captain Holt's throbbing abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
    his need had first become apparent his discomfort had been remorselessly increasing, the
    aching fullness of his lower body become more and more painful as he was forced to
    continue to ignore the call of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now,
    after more than an hour of increasing discomfort, he was beginning to wonder how much
    longer he would have to hold out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Never
    before in his life had he suffered such an extreme need for relief; his stomach was
    visibly swollen and hurting so much that he had to grit his teeth against the pain.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This he could, and would, endure, because a man,
    particularly an army officer, should be able to suffer any level of pain without
    complaint, particularly when he knew that it would end as soon as he was able to have a
    few minutes of privacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse than the pain
    was the increasing pressure he was suffering, a most urgent need to release his waters
    that was taking a more and more determined effort to resist.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The effort required to contain himself was
    becoming more that he could manage, and, regardless of etiquette, he had to cross his
    legs, twisting them tightly together as he fought to avoid disgracing himself.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even in this position he could hardly find the
    strength to contain his waters, and whenever he was certain that the ladies' attention was
    diverted he would grip himself tightly for a few moments, savoring the slight relief this
    brought him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Just when he was reaching the point
    when he felt that any further restraint would be impossible, so great had become the
    pressure of his needs, Captain Holt realized they were approaching to gates of Strechley
    Manor, and within five minutes their journey would be over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The thought of the relief that was so near was almost too much to bear, and
    he groaned with the effort he had to make to control himself as he struggled on the brink
    of disgracing himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So intense was his
    need that he felt himself losing control and automatically thrust one hand into his lap,
    gripping his manhood with all his strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Afraid
    that this action would make his condition obvious to the ladies, he moved his hand
    immediately, when, to his horror, he felt a spread of wetness in his underwear as he
    failed to contain himself for an instant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    shock of this awful moment somehow gave him added strength to regain control, and he
    quickly rested both hands across his thighs so as to cover any sign of his indiscretion.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Even when the journey had nearly
    ended, his ordeal was not over, for he had never visited the house for long before, and
    had no idea where the room he had to visit so urgently was situated.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He could never embarrass any of the ladies by
    asking them for this information, and it would be rude to ask even Mr. Blakley this
    immediately on arrival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Etiquette demanded
    that he should wait until Blakley offered him the use of these facilities, but he was far
    from certain that he would even be able to walk into the house without disgracing himself,
    and the prospect of having to stand, or sit, in the drawing room making polite
    conversation until he could bring his need to Blakley's attention was unendurable, and
    what would he do if Blakley was not present?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Faced
    with the prospect of almost certainly disgracing himself if he entered Strechley Manor,
    Captain Holt resorted to making some implausible excuse, saying that he was concerned
    about the walk of one of the horses, and that he would remain in the carriage and assist
    the groom in stabling the horses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He would
    rejoin them later, he responded to their protests; it would only take five minutes to
    examine the horse, as he wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Holt
    knew that there was nothing wrong with the horses, and would not, at that moment, have
    been capable of noticing if there was, but was thinking only of the privacy and relief
    that the stables would offer him.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As soon as the ladies had dismounted
    from the carriage, Captain Holt twisted his legs together as his distress increased to a
    level he would not have thought possible, and then, as his desire became more than he
    could resist, he clasped himself tightly with both hands as he struggled to contain the
    imminent flood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As they entered the stable
    yard, no longer caring about anything except his relief, Captain Holt leapt from the
    carriage and rushed into the nearest empty stall, frantically trying to unlace and
    unbutton his breeches and pull aside his underwear before the flood started.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But after so long under such strain, his body
    could respond to his demands no longer, and before his undressing was completed the dam
    burst and the pent up torrent began to pour forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    he at last managed to pull his clothing aside and allow his waters to gush unrestrained,
    Captain Holt could not resist a sigh of relief at the end of a time of such agonizing
    restraint. But this was rapidly tempered by dismay as he surveyed the dark, wet stains
    that had spread down the legs of his breeches when he had failed to contain himself at the
    last moment, disgracing himself so that he could not show himself at Strechley Manor any
    more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No matter how dire the circumstances
    had been, it was unthinkable that any gentleman should be seen to have committed such a
    dreadful indiscretion, and should this become known, then he would ostracized by the whole
    of the county gentry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He was wondering how he could return
    home without his disgrace being seen when the head groom discretely entered the stable,
    guessing what condition the Captain had been in, and suspecting that he might have
    disgraced himself, as he had seen other gentlemen do on several occasions.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The groom coughed to attract Captain Holt's
    attention, surveying the marks on his breeches as he turned.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a situation was a lucrative event for an
    enterprising and discreet servant.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I fear that one of the horses
    has misbehaved and soiled your breeches, sir,&quot; he said, providing Captain Holt with
    the excuse he had racking his brains for. &quot;It would be unseemly for the ladies to see
    you in such a state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps you wish to
    return home and change, while I will get the footman to proffer your apologies to Mrs.
    Blakley.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Captain Holt could scarcely hide his
    gratitude for the groom's strategy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His honor
    would be preserved, as would his social status in the county.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He reached for his purse and pressed a guinea into
    the groom's hand. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Do you wish to borrow a cloak
    to cover yourself on the journey?&quot; continued the groom, offering him the garment.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Captain Holt took it with gratitude, and another
    two guineas changed hands. In his agitated state, he would have paid the groom ten guineas
    if he had demanded that sum, and still considered it cheap to conceal his dreadful
    indiscretion.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
