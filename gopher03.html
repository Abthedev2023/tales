    I was shopping at the local supermarket and was packing the goods as they came through the
    checkout. It was quite a busy time and there was a long queue at each till. When the last
    items came through, I packed them up and turned to pay the cashier. As I handed over the
    money I heard someone say &quot;Noooo&quot; in a shrill anguished voice. I looked, and the
    next lady in line had her hands firmly jammed in her crotch and was doing a frantic
    pee-pee dance. As I collected my change she seemed to get herself under control. I turned
    to her and said that I sympathized with her predicament and asked her whether I could help
    her pack up her shopping. She looked terribly embarrassed but accepted my offer, so as her
    shopping came through I bagged it for her. She made her payment and accepted her change,
    and then suddenly she was struggling for control again. She shoved her hand sharply into
    her crotch and juggled up and down like mad. I put my hand on her shoulder and helped her
    struggle away, bringing her shopping and mine along too. We just about made it outside the
    door when she completely lost it and the dark telltale stain appeared on her white
    trousers. It quickly spread down her legs and then a river seemed to flow straight through
    the now dark saturated fabric, making a noise like a waterfall, attracting the gaze of
    everyone around. Some looked disgusted, whilst others looked sympathetic. I put my arm
    round her shoulder and pulled her towards me to shield her from seeing the stares and
    looks of disgust. She was trembling and sobbing with embarrassment. I asked her where she
    had parked her car, but she replied that she was traveling on the bus.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, you can't go home on the bus in this state,&quot; I responded, &quot;How far
    have you to go?&quot; She told me that she lived right across on the other side of town,
    so I offered to give her a lift home, or alternatively, as I lived nearer, for her to come
    back to my place and clean up. She gratefully accepted the latter offer, so we went to my
    car, where I put some travel rugs on the seat so she could sit down without staining the
    upholstery. I tried to make light conversation during the short journey, but Julie was
    still embarrassed and still looked a bit distressed. We exited the car and just inside my
    front door her hands shot down to her crotch and another river of pee streamed out. As she
    started sobbing I pulled her to me and held her in a comforting embrace.<br>
    <br>
    When she had finished she said, &quot;Now look at what I've done, you look as though
    you've pissed yourself, too. Oh my goodness, how terrible, you have been so kind and
    helpful and look at how I repay you. I have pissed all down your trousers and left a
    puddle on the floor of your hall.&quot; And then she started sobbing again.<br>
    <br>
    I led her into the kitchen and sat her down on a wooden dining chair. I told her it was
    OK, and that accidents do happen sometime and she really should not worry, I offered to
    run her a warm bath, and she accepted. I put the kettle on to make us some hot tea and
    then started the bath running. When I returned, Julie had calmed down a bit and we chatted
    as she drank her tea. She confessed that she frequently took herself to the brink of
    pissing her knickers because she loved the thrill and sensation of a full bladder, however
    this was the first time she had gone over the edge in a public place and was mad at
    herself for misjudging it so badly. She said how aroused it made her feel and while we
    were talking she was gently rubbing herself through her wet clothes. Naturally by now I
    had a raging hard on and I admitted that I had found the whole thing very arousing myself.<br>
    <br>
    Without further discussion we both hastened to strip of and hurried to the bathroom. After
    a good warm bath together, we dried each other off and moved, naked, to the lounge. I got
    out some wine and a couple of glasses and we sat embracing each other and chatting about
    the fantastic sensations we had just experienced. We agreed to do it again, so we drank
    and drank until we were both bursting again. We held each other tight in a firm embrace
    and we let go together, pissing all over each other carefree. Then I gently penetrated her
    and we had fantastic sex, and then we laid back enjoying each other's attention.<br>
    <br>
    Finally we bathed again and I found Julie some dry clothes and then drove her home, She is
    now a regular visitor to my home and she often comes through the front door in a state of
    desperation. I often think how fortunate I am to have been in that supermarket queue at
    just the right time.<br>
