    </strong>Debbie was running as fast as she could through the concourse. Well, running was
    being generous considering how tight her short little skirt was. As the athlete amongst
    her group of friends it bothered her that she was lagging yards behind them. They all just
    had to catch this train otherwise they'd be stranded in New York for at least three hours.
    Plus on top of all that she had to pee like you wouldn't believe - no, Debbie wasn't too
    happy right now.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It had all started innocently
    enough, Debbie and three of her postgrad classmates from Princeton had decided to go into
    the city that evening and hit the clubs. Debbie, Jennifer, Suzi and Shanique had ridden
    the train in earlier that evening, had a great dinner and spent the evening at one of the
    hottest clubs around. Debbie had been knocking back tropical drinks all evening, and
    moving from the warmth of the club out into the cold December night, back into a
    superheated cab, back out into the cold outside Penn Station and then into the heat again
    had played havoc with her bladder. She literally hopped down the flight of stairs to the
    platform and bounced into the carriage. No more than twenty seconds later the 1.19 a.m.
    train pulled away as Debbie drunkenly slumped into a seat next to her equally inebriated
    friends.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The conductor came by almost
    immediately, told them it was a light load tonight and asked for their tickets.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Where are the bathrooms?&quot;
    Suzi asked urgently. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Last carriage,&quot; he
    replied,&quot; we're running a short train this morning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the conductor moved away Suzi
    shot out of her seat, with Debbie close behind her. About a minute later they got to the
    last carriage, opened up the bathroom door, and recoiled in disgust. Not only was the
    smell atrocious, but also the floor was covered about an inch deep with some kind of gooey
    fluid. No way could they seek relief in there. Suddenly the ache in her lower stomach
    seemed twice as bad. Debbie told Suzi she was going back, when Suzi grabbed her arm and
    whispered that she couldn't wait because she had to more than just pee. Suzi walked
    through the carriage, collected some newspapers and a plastic bag, and then told Debbie to
    stand watch as she moved between two sets of seats. Suzi put the newspaper on the floor,
    then spread out the plastic bag on the newspaper, took some tissues out of her pocketbook
    and pulled off her panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Debbie was amazed - only Suzi,
    desperate as she was, would think to clean up afterwards. Hearing Suzi's strong stream,
    not Suzi's silent stream she drunkenly noted, made her clench her muscles tight less they
    let go in sympathy. Several minutes later Suzi emerged, tied a knot in the top of the
    plastic bag and threw it in the trash. &quot;I feel sooo much better now&quot;, she said
    happily, knowing full well that Debbie wished she felt even half as relieved as Suzi did.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They rushed back to their carriage
    and told the other two about the situation with the toilet. Shanique looked like she was
    in as bad a shape as Debbie, while Jennifer thought for a few seconds and then came up
    with an idea. She suggested they play a hold-it game, and see who could last the longest
    if they each put $50 in. The three desperate amigas agreed to try it, with Suzi as the
    neutral judge to make sure no one cheated. It was a sign of how desperate they were that
    the finish line was the car park at the train station, and not their dorm. Debbie figured
    that it was about fifty minutes to Princeton, and also realized that was going to be about
    twenty or thirty minutes too far. Just to make things really interesting Suzi reached down
    into her huge pocketbook and pulled out a bottle of wine she had &quot;borrowed&quot; from
    one of the bars. They all had to take a mouthful every minute to keep the pressure on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Debbie looked at her friends to
    check out her competition. Shanique was bouncing up and down in her seat, hands pressed
    tightly between her legs. She was doing the pee-pee dance sitting down. Jen looked more
    composed, but Deb knew that she was feeling the strain too, shifting her weight every few
    seconds and keeping her thighs squeezed together. Debbie herself just ached, she couldn't
    remember ever feeling this full and it was starting to hurt. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The rumbling and bumbling of the
    train over the tracks didn't help either, nor did the repeated top-ups from the wine
    bottle. The train shuddered violently and shook from side to side - each of the girls
    squealed and frantically shoved their hands even further between their legs. Deb felt a
    touch of moisture as she willed her fingers to push up against her peehole even harder
    still and knew she had let a tiny spurt out, it couldn't be much longer now. Totally
    buzzed as she was, she also decided that there was no way she was going to ruin her
    expensive French panties, so she stood up as best she could and took her panties off. They
    still looked dry and clean so she packed them in her pocketbook. Jen and Shan stood up and
    did exactly the same, prompting Suzi to double up laughing. She made them all sit in one
    of the triple seats and lift their skirts up so she could take a picture. One dark, one
    light and one shaved she noted, giggling violently.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Deb felt a burning sensation down
    there as the pain around her bladder increased even more as she tried not to start
    laughing. The sports jock in her came to the fore and she decided that this was a contest
    she was absolutely going to win. How could she, physically fit as she was, and used to
    giving her all, lose out to her friends? The bottle of wine came around again and Deb
    finished it off with a single swig. She looked at the bottle longingly, 750ml. She was
    sure that by now she could fill it at least twice. A sudden &quot;Oh, my God&quot; snapped
    her out of her reverie, and she looked across to see Jen bent over double with both hands
    forced up between her legs; &quot;I'm leaking&quot;, she yelled. She quickly shifted her
    skirt out of the way and shuffled forwards on the seat, bringing her knees up around her
    chin with her heels resting on the edge of the seat. &quot;Look out below&quot; she
    said.&nbsp; Sitting across from her, Deb could see a tiny trickle running down between her
    friend's lips and glistening between her cheeks. Jen reached down, and using two of the
    fingers on her right hand spread her lips apart in a &quot;V&quot;.&nbsp; She gasped as a
    huge stream spurted out of her, not downwards onto the floor, but clear across the seat in
    a big yellowish arc, landing on the seat back only a foot or two away from Deb. Deb
    watched in fascination as the torrent seemed to grow stronger and arced higher, and for
    several seconds it actually cleared the seat she was sitting on and splashed onto the seat
    behind them. Just as abruptly the cascade stopped, Jen mopped up a few desultory final
    spurts and she was done.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, that wasn't supposed to
    happen... I was sure I was aiming downwards. But once I got started I just had to see how
    far I could go. It reminded me of learning to pee standing up when my brother challenged
    me when I was six!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">By now, Deb was so desperate that
    she was past the point of caring, and her muscles and nerves had been strained for so long
    they had become numb. If she didn't think about it, she really didn't have to go - except
    for that almost unbearable ache between her legs. Shan was hanging in there too, although
    they'd had to change seats to avoid the remains of Jen's jet and the smell. They felt the
    train slowing down as it approached Princeton Junction and it finally jolted to a halt.
    Neither of them could stand up straight and their friends had to physically help them off
    the train. No one else got on or off the train, and as soon as it headed south towards
    Trenton the station was deserted.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What do say we call it a
    tie?&quot; Shan asked. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; replied Deb, &quot;but why don't we use
    distance as a decider? Let's see who can pee the furthest and they get the money and we'll
    have a p-trophy made up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Moving down into the car park, they
    both leant against the back-end of a BMW to ensure an equal starting point and the other
    two girls were distance judges. The competitive nature of Deb emerged again, and even in
    her drunken state she decided to let Shan go first, so when Suzi said &quot;GO&quot; she
    didn't push, and instead looked over and watched Shan literally explode as her pee shot
    everywhere, hissing violently, before she stabilized her stream and got speed and
    direction. After watching this Debs bladder just caved in and started emptying as fast as
    she could. Deb leant back as far as she could to get some height and almost immediately
    her stream was splashing down almost two feet further then Shan's. Shan was trying almost
    every position to get more distance but couldn't beat her. Then she shut down in
    mid-stream, readjusted the grip and spread of her pussy lips, grunted, and watched with
    satisfaction as a jet landed several inches beyond Debs. After a few more seconds Shan was
    done and she gasped with relief. Deb was not to be beaten, and even after nearly forty
    seconds of constant high-speed pissing didn't feel anywhere close to empty. Instead of
    stopping like Shan she just pushed harder and watched in satisfaction as her pee arched
    almost above her head before falling to the ground beyond Shan's best effort. She had won,
    but she wasn't done. Her friends watched in amazement as she continued to pour it on for
    at least another thirty seconds before the final drips fell onto the back bumper of the
    BMW.<o:p></o:p></span></font><strong></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"></strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Wow - I wonder
    how much that was?&quot; Suzi asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;At least $100 worth,&quot; Deb
    answered, puzzled by how wet and slippery she had been before she even started to pee.
    Could watching Jen have turned her on that much?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
