     Late

    </strong>
    </font><br><br><br>At the ripe age of 52 I thought I knew myself sexually yet, I recently 
      discovered a new facet, totally unexpected and very much by accident. The 
      accident in question being in my knickers, down my legs and in a spreading 
      puddle on the bathroom floor! I wet myself! I'm still not sure why it 
      happened. I can usually hold on quite well when desperate, though as with 
      many women my age Tena Lady are essential wear when I have a bad cough, as 
      having had three children does rather weaken ones pelvic floor.<br><br>Anyway, I had utterly and completely wet my knickers, tights, control 
      pants (which I wear over my tights), skirt, everything, something that I 
      had rarely done before in my adult life other than a few occasions when 
      pregnant (when I had also once wet the bed). That was a long time ago and 
      any woman who has been pregnant will have similar tales to tell. So there 
      I stood. Soaking wet, face flushed red with embarrassment and a strange 
      excitement, wee still dripping down my legs but with a feeling of 
      incredible release almost akin to an orgasm and hornier than I had felt in 
      years. The feeling as the hot wee filled by pants and washed over my clit 
      before pouring down my legs was unbelievable and once it started I didn't 
      want it to stop. Without thinking I had pulled up my skirt and squeezed 
      myself through my pants, the extra pressure on my throbbing little button 
      sending me over the top, gasping and crying as waves of pleasure rippled 
      over me. And all the time my husband stood there watching me, a huge bulge 
      in his trousers!<br><br>As my orgasm subsided I felt him pull me to him, kissing me wildly on 
      the lips, one hand between my legs caressing me through my soaking undies 
      as I moaned in delight. Then, grabbing the towels from the rail he dragged 
      me to the bedroom, pulled back the covers and threw the towels onto the 
      bed pushing me down on top of them, all the time fondling my wet bottom. 
      Then, slowly, he pulled my undies down and took me more passionately that 
      I can ever remember. I actually had a multiple orgasm for the first time 
      in years and peed myself again as I came. It was some time before we came 
      back to earth.<br><br>After mopping up the bathroom floor and putting the towels and my 
      underwear in the washing machine we poured a glass of wine and tried to 
      make sense of it all.<br><br>We were on holiday in a small chalet we own on a little park in 
      mid-Wales and had strolled the half mile or so down to the village pub for 
      a drink before dinner. I'd only had a couple of gin and tonics so wasn't 
      drunk and did not feel the need to visit the ladies before the 20 minute 
      walke home. We had only been walking for a few minutes though when I 
      suddenly found myself needing to wee and badly. I started to walk faster 
      and when my husband asked why I told him that I was suddenly desperate for 
      the loo and explained that I hadn't needed to go when we left but the gin 
      seemed to have gone straight through me! With a smile he suggested I duck 
      behind the hedge and when I pointedly refused said that going behind the 
      hedge might be better than wet pants- how prophetic.<br><br>I told him in no uncertain terms that my pants would stay very dry 
      thank you very much, but with the chalet park in site I was becoming 
      increasingly unsure of my ability to hold on. However, my husband seemed 
      to be walking so slowly, and he had the door key. I urged him to hurry, 
      saying that I was desperate and I was, jiggling around and crossing my 
      legs and squeezing my thighs as I tried to control a bursting bladder. He 
      just laughed telling me that I looked a right sight and to act my age. By 
      now I was sweating and in a panic and just blurted out that if he didn't 
      hurry up I really was going to have a very public accident.<br><br>How I made it to the chalet without embarrassing myself I really don't 
      know. As we reached the door I almost lost it, the anticipation of 
      reaching the loo making me momentarily lose control and I felt a hot 
      trickle in my knickers. Hubby fumbled with the lock as I urged him to 
      hurry as I was doing it in my pants. As the door swung open, I dashed for 
      the toilet but the battle was already lost. That first trickle became a 
      flood as I felt a hot wetness fill my satin knickers, initially held back 
      by my tights and control briefs then flooding down my thighs just as I got 
      into the loo. I tried to pull my skirt up and undies down but it was far 
      too late. I suppose I could have sat on the loo and just done it through 
      my pants that way but I was in shock at what I was doing and just stood 
      there, a seemingly never ending torrent in my knickers, cascading down my 
      legs, into my shoes and across the floor.<br><br>Thinking about it now the sexual outcome was a result of the feelings 
      from my bursting bladder, my tight underwear rubbing me in the right 
      places, the tension as I became desperate and nervous of what might happen 
      and the sudden loss of control. Add the hot wee over my already sensitive 
      clit and it all started to make sense. My husband said that when I first 
      mentioned my need he had treated it as a joke. I sometimes sit fidgeting 
      at home waiting for a break in a TV programme and telling him I need the 
      loo. He admitted that he wondered if I always made it dry (I usually had) 
      and had sometimes pulled my pants out of the laundry basket to see if they 
      were wet or had pee stains! However, the little leaks that like most 
      women, have remained my secret- the Tena Lady or my private wash bin saw 
      to that.<br><br>He then admitted that the idea of me wetting myself, whether a damp 
      gusset from leaving it a bit late in getting to the loo or soaking wet 
      following a full accident excited him. When he realised that I really was 
      bursting as we walked back he had had trouble hiding his excitement and 
      had to walk slowly to hide the huge erection he was sporting. The more he 
      delayed the more desperate I became, adding to his tension (and mine!). 
      When I lost control in front of him and just stood there wetting myself he 
      had almost come in his trousers! He had wanted to hold me close then but 
      was afraid of my reaction but when I made myself come he just had to grab 
      me, feel my wet pants and ravish me.<br><br>We made love again that night, slowly and delicately,it was gorgeous 
      and then talked further about me wetting myself. I didn't quite promise to 
      do it again but privately was intrigued by the feelings that I had 
      experienced.<br><br>A couple of days later hubby went off fishing for the day and I had the 
      chalet to myself. I sat in the sun reading and drinking copious amounts of 
      iced water. The sun was warm, my book interesting and I kept putting of 
      going to the loo even though I was getting very full. In fact I was quite 
      enjoying the feeling. The deck at the back off our chalet is very private, 
      overlooking woodland and fields. With no one about I slipped my hand up my 
      skirt and began to rub myself through my cotton knickers, partly to help 
      me hold my bursting bladder and partly because my need to pee was making 
      my clit tingle. I was in heaven as I gradually let myself become desperate 
      again. So desperate that it was pointless trying to get up from my sun 
      lounger; I already knew I wouldn't make it to the loo. Then it happened. A 
      hot flood poured into my knickers and over my hand and I came almost 
      immediately. I lay there for some time, quite enjoying the feeling of wet 
      pants on my private parts.<br><br>Now I knew that the feelings when I had had the earlier accident in my 
      pants were not an aberration but an incredibly sensual experience and one 
      that I had just repeated, albeit in private. However, I knew two things, 
      one that I loved the feeling of wetting myself and secondly that it would 
      also turn my husband on if I could pluck up the courage to do it in front 
      of him again. The more I thought about it the more I knew I had to do it.<br><br>Ever practical I decided that the deck was rather more suitable for wet 
      activities than the bathroom floor and that some protection on the bed 
      might be beneficial. As hubby would not be back for some time I took the 
      car into the nearby town and bought a waterproof mattress cover which went 
      straight onto the bed with a thick towel over it and under the sheet.<br><br>That evening we went to the pub again and this time I drank lager, 
      which I know always makes me want to pee. My husband knows it as well but 
      said nothing as I refrained from using the ladies before we left. I was 
      soon desperate again and this time laughed and joked about my condition, 
      loving his response to my very genuine desperation. I almost misjudged it 
      and had already leaked badly by the time we arrived back at the chalet. My 
      knickers and tights were quite wet as were the tops of my thighs but 
      nothing was yet visible. Pulling hubby out onto the deck I kissed him 
      passionately and pulled his hand between my legs, hearing him gasp as he 
      felt my wetness. God Cal, you've peed yourself. he gasped as another 
      trickle warmed my crotch. I'm bursting, I whispered. I can't hang on; I'm 
      going to have an accident in my knickers. Then his fingers found my clit 
      and I lost all control, totally wetting myself for the second time that 
      day. Muttering that the bed was protected I dragged him into the bedroom 
      where he practically took me by force, ripping the gusset of my tights and 
      having me through the leg of my dripping wet knickers.<br><br>Exhausted, we drifted off to sleep, he naked except for a T-shirt and 
      me with just my top and still in my pee-soaked underwear. The bed was wet 
      beneath me but I didn't care and fell asleep immediately. I awoke a couple 
      of hours later, badly needing to pee again, and almost panicked at first 
      my underwear and the sheet were still damp of course and as I came round 
      initially thought that I had wet the bed! This gave me an idea that 
      initially shocked me. I needed to pee again and was already wet; so why 
      not just do it as I lay there? The sheer naughtiness of deliberately 
      wetting my bed intrigued me, what would it feel like? I now knew how it 
      felt to wet my pants so wetting the bed was perhaps a logical next 
      step.<br><br>I rolled over and put my arm round my husband. Still asleep he stirred 
      as I gently rubbed my wet knickers against him. We lay like this for 
      another half hour until I could hold my bursting bladder no more. As I lay 
      on my side gently cuddling hubby I felt the now familiar hot wetness flood 
      my pants and pour over my thigh, spreading under me, soaking my top and 
      the sheet, a warm spreading wetness, enveloping me and my beloved. As my 
      flood soaked him he woke, wondering what was going on but I simply held 
      him tight whispering into his ear that I had had another accident and had 
      wet the bed. We made love again in the warm puddle on a soaking sheet.<br><br>Let's just say that the rest of the holiday involved a great deal of 
      washing- sheets, towels and many pairs of my knickers and tights. I wet my 
      pants every day, usually for hubby as much as myself, but a couple of 
      times for my own pleasure. On several mornings I simply wet the bed rather 
      than get up to use the loo and each time enjoyed not only the experience 
      but the sex that followed.<br><br>Back home now I have to be more careful. I had rather got used to 
      letting myself get desperate, not caring if my knickers were wet when I 
      eventually went to the loo and of course, simply wetting myself for hubby. 
      After some near misses at work (I carried spare pants following an 
      afternoon spent wondering if anyone knew my knickers were wet) I limited 
      my waiting and desperation to weekends. I had to be careful of the bed 
      wetting as well,it had almost become a habit and on one occasion I woke 
      bursting in the early hours and simply let go, dozing afterwards and only 
      realising that I had wet the bed when I woke up again. Of course it was a 
      work day and although I just had time for a quick shower I had to leave 
      the bed till I got home. The sight of our wet bed that evening made me 
      realise that I had to make sure not to lose control of myself, especially 
      as I had been bursting on the bus home and had wet my pants again. As I 
      sat on the loo there I realised that there was little point taking them 
      off as they were already wet!<br><br>
