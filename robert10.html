    <br>
    We had intended to stop our stories, give up fantasies, become decent members of polite
    society but....<br>
    <br>
    Its 3 o'clock in the morning and I've just been for a wee. As I creep back into bed, May
    mumbles in her sleep rolling over to deny me even the three inches of mattress she usually
    allows me. Carefully I clamber over her to take her side of the bunk. The duvet doesn't
    stretch to my new side because May has it all. Is it like this for everyone who sleeps
    with someone else?<br>
    <br>
    She looks so sweet curled up comfortably that I haven't the heart to yank the cover over
    to me. My ploy is to slide very close to her and put my arms around her. When she's asleep
    all her actions are reflex. She mumbles again and returns my embrace. It has seldom
    failed, she's so warm that the duvet isn't really needed and by nestling below her she
    rolls on top of me bringing the duvet with her. Being asleep she doesn't concentrate on
    the mutual aspect of the sexual feelings that are aroused. She wriggles and jiggles a few
    times and then seems to forget. I've become used to lying with her weight on top of me
    waiting to outmaneuver her when next she moves so that I get my bit of the bed back.<br>
    <br>
    How's this a wet story? Well I am very fond of May but she has one or two characteristic
    twists that take some getting used to. Whenever she feels my body against hers she starts
    to dribble. I think it's involuntary but I wouldn't be sure. Sure enough a damp feeling
    against my left thigh told me her body knew I was there. I whispered, &quot;Hold on a bit
    longer, lovely one.&quot; She dribbled again. I didn't want another wet bed so I tried a
    second time before waking her. &quot;Just hold on till 5&quot; I said quietly into her
    ear, &quot;and you can piddle as much as you please.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    That brought a response, &quot;Mmmm&quot;. She appeared to go back to sleep and I relaxed,
    drifted off and knew no more till the morning.<br>
    <br>
    Saturday was a lovely day for boating, no wind, and warm with a thin cover of cloud. Our
    slow breakfast with fresh orange and toast was followed by a couple of hours along the
    canal through typically English countryside, all little fields with cows, sheep, yellow
    corn, and an occasional hump-backed bridge leading to a sleepy village. We rose our
    glasses to the few people we saw and stopped for an hour to enjoy the sight of some
    volunteers rebuilding an ancient shed. They came across and shared a pot of tea. Then we
    set off again. May had not peed yet.<br>
    <br>
    Midday and we arrived at the back gate of a supermarket. Our shopping took half an hour
    and was fully successful. We celebrated with a flagon of cider. May did not pee.<br>
    <br>
    After a sandwich and a pint of lime cordial we set off again. May did not pee. A
    delightful black and white pub was too good to pass by so we stopped for a drink. All this
    while May was her normal, cheerful, charming self and she did not pee- it's something we
    notice about each other.<br>
    <br>
    In the middle of the afternoon, say about three, we decided to stop for the day. A long
    cooling drink and half an hour lazing in the weak afternoon sunshine had us feeling too
    lazy to do more. In the distance was a red brick manor house, which we thought, would be
    interesting. May still did not pee. We walked the half-mile or so and looked around taking
    in the walled garden and ending up in the churchyard next door.<br>
    <br>
    At this point May said, &quot;I've got a pain.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The natural response in our normal situation was to say, &quot;Do you want to pee?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She replied, &quot;Not really.&quot; She did seem a bit subdued as we wandered about
    looking at the dates on the gravestones but I put it down to thoughts of mortality. May
    still had not peed and as this was not a holding day, so I was a bit concerned, thinking
    that our games might have done some damage.<br>
    <br>
    A party of tourists from Korea came into the churchyard and they were busily taking
    pictures and we were invited to pose against the background of a particularly ornate
    gravestone. They must have assumed we were local citizens. Joining in the spirit of the
    thing we stood either side of a stone angel and put our arms around it. Smiling and
    laughing with our newfound friends we tried to communicate across the language barrier.<br>
    <br>
    Then the church clock struck half past four and May said, &quot;Soon it will be five
    o'clock.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What will happen at five o'clock?&quot; said the one who had the best grasp of
    English.<br>
    <br>
    I have this habit of speaking without thinking too carefully and said, &quot;Oh we English
    relax and start our evening then.&quot; The Korean explained this to the rest of the party
    and they laughed nervously, as did May.<br>
    <br>
    We left them to their photography and went on peering at the dates on the graves. May
    seemed more and more distracted but when I asked if she was all right she said she was.
    Inside the church it was cool and calm, 500 years of use had made the pews shiny and the
    stone floor had worn down in places. We sat for a while and May couldn't get comfortable
    so we went back out. Most of the Koreans had followed us inside but a couple remained
    admiring the scene across the village. While May ambled off I entered a slow conversation
    about village life in England and how it was similar to that in Korea.<br>
    <br>
    The clock struck five. In the distance May was coming around the side of the church. She
    looked up at the clock tower dreamily then I heard her exclaim &quot;Ohhh!&quot; She
    flexed her knees momentarily and scuttled aimlessly amongst the gravestones for a moment
    or two then stood with her feet a little apart and her hands up over her mouth. Then she
    peed, copiously, fiercely, for ages. The Koreans watched dumbfounded as this typical
    English woman pissed heartily all over one of the recumbent monuments.<br>
    <br>
    There followed one of those halts in time. She looked up at us, eyes wide, and mouth open.
    The Korean and I did exactly the same. The pause lasted some time and none of us moved.
    Our visitor broke the silence, &quot;She starts the evening now?&quot; I remembered my
    silly quip and without due deference to my companion's grasp of England and the English I
    said, &quot;My goodness, yes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Hurrying across to poor May I put my arm around her and said, &quot;Whatever
    happened?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    It was a silly question but she didn't seem to notice, just looked at me in amazement and
    said, &quot;One minute I was listening to the wind in the trees, the next I wanted to pee
    like I've never wanted to pee before. It came on me all of a sudden, there wasn't even
    time to find a place or even try to hold it back, I was peeing before I could think. All I
    could think was, at last I can pee.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    We hurried out of the churchyard and waved as the first of the Koreans came from the
    church. As we bustled along the lane back to the canal the party were gathering round the
    one who had witnessed it pointing to the vast puddle and chattering excitedly. Whatever
    did he say to explain this curious English custom?<br>
    <br>
    On the way back May was much more cheerful than I would have expected, perhaps it was the
    relief. I prodded her with questions. Didn't she want to pee earlier, why did she hold on
    so long? She had no answers and swore that she wasn't trying to hold it all day, in fact
    hadn't been aware that she hadn't been to the loo since the previous evening. This was
    most unlike her and I wondered if we should find a doctor but as she felt much better and
    the pain had eased off she said we should go back and have a lazy evening listening to the
    radio.<br>
    <br>
    Later, when we had fed ourselves and heard some strange modern music we sat on the cabin
    roof amiably wriggling our toes and exchanging an occasional kiss, I leaned towards her
    and suggested we go to bed early. May suddenly lit up. &quot;It was you, you said hold it
    till five.&quot; I looked stupidly at her and she followed saying, &quot;I remember now,
    you said in bed last night, just hold on till five, and that's what I've done without
    realizing it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    For a minute I struggled to take it in. Hypnotism, too many hold it games, my lovely
    trusting friend, it did appear to be my doing. To say I was sorry doesn't get near what I
    felt, all I wanted was a few more hours in a dry bed and now I'd caused a potentially very
    embarrassing situation.<br>
    <br>
    By now I felt worse than she did and it showed. May's resilience came to my rescue and
    after dinner she suggested I might feel better if she set me a penance. So, with a
    mischievous twinkle in her eye she put her hand on my thigh, leaned toward my ear and
    whispered, &quot;Just hold it till five.&quot; Staring steadily back at her I nodded as
    humbly as I could.<br>
    <br>
    The second part of this story doesn't take long to tell. It was already 8 in the evening
    and I was an hour beyond my last leak. By nine we were curled up in bed and by ten I had
    gone to sleep still feeling pretty wretched. When I woke at two I was feeling less
    wretched but considerably more in need of a pee. It didn't take rocket science to know
    that I would wake May if I tried to lie there till 5 writhing about and clutching myself
    but the English notion of fair play held me.<br>
    <br>
    Creeping out of bed I got dressed and calculated that there were three hours to go. At my
    walking speed that is 12 miles and that's the only way I can hold. Blank the mind and walk
    like a zombie, six miles out and six miles back. Cool night air, regular paces along
    beside the canal on and on, ache in the bladder, never stop, never change the rhythm count
    the paces, watch the dawn over the fields.<br>
    <br>
    Arriving back I heard the church clock strike a single note. In anguish I thought it must
    be half past four so I went on past the boat intending to complete my punishment with a
    further couple of miles in the opposite direction. I hadn't gone fifty yards (meters) when
    I heard May calling gently, &quot;Robert don't leave me again.&quot; Turning back I saw
    her there on the back deck in the pale dawn light bronzed by the rising sun and thought
    I'd never seen anyone so beautiful. She doesn't wear any clothing at night.<br>
    <br>
    She beckoned to me, so alluring, &quot;Come on its already half past five.&quot; What a
    relief! Stepping onto the deck she clasped me round the waist with both arms and squeezed.
    It was like squeezing an orange. My valves gave in and the ordeal was over, nearly. We
    stood a moment or two oblivious to the glories of the dawn but were disturbed by an early
    morning walker. It was a Korean stepping out for a breath of fresh air from his overheated
    hotel. He glanced down at the puddle on the deck as I wrapped May in my arms to preserve
    her modesty.<br>
    <br>
    He said quite amiably, &quot;Ah five o'clock, day begins?&quot; and marched on.<br>
    <br>
    Regards to all strangers whether damp or just perplexed,<br>
