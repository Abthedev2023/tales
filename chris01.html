    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I've been into peeing since I was a
    teenager, and I did a lot of stuff in the privacy of my bedroom when I was in high school.
    I had a few close calls during junior high and high school, where I leaked a little into
    my panties, but nothing that anyone noticed. One of my most memorable experiences happened
    in college. I went to a small private school that was out in the middle of nowhere. During
    my junior year, I took summer classes so I could graduate one semester early. One Saturday
    in late July, one of the student groups organized a day trip to an amusement park that was
    about 150 miles away. They chartered a bus, and we left at 9:00 o'clock in the morning.
    The bus was very comfortable, with air conditioning and a bathroom, and the ride there was
    uneventful. We arrived at about 11:30, and we were told that the bus was going to pick us
    up at 5:00. The trip back to school was more interesting. I spent the day at the park with
    a good friend from my English class named Susie. It was a warm summer day. I was wearing
    cutoff jeans and a bikini top, and Susie wore khaki shorts and a tank top. The only
    mistake she made was wearing gym shoes and socks. We went on the water rides and got
    thoroughly soaked. Our clothes dried quickly in the heat, but Susie's shoes and socks were
    all squishy. I had worn my beach sandals, so I didn't have this problem. She couldn't
    stand it. She took her shoes and socks off, and went barefoot the rest of the afternoon.
    By four o'clock, we had been on almost every ride in the park. The temperature had risen
    to around eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit, and we were hot, sweaty, hungry and thirsty. We
    had spent much of the afternoon standing in long lines for the rides. Susie wanted to go
    on one of the water rides again, but when we got there, the line was ridiculous. The only
    thing we had had since breakfast was pretzels and popcorn, so we decided to look for
    someplace that had real food and beer.We found a pizza stand that served draft beer. We
    sat down to eat and relax. In the hot afternoon sun, the cold beer tasted great! I was
    finishing off my second Miller Lite, and Susie was on her third. Then we noticed the time.
    It was twenty to five. We had to be back at the parking lot at five, and we were way over
    on the other side. We hurried across the park, and Susie said she had to pee. I had to go,
    too, so we started looking for the bathrooms. We found them quickly, but when we got
    inside, there were three women waiting in line, and one had a small child with her. Shit,
    I said to myself. This is not good. But there were four stalls, and the line was moving
    fairly quickly. Susie was in front of me, and another person came in and stood behind
    me.Soon the only person left in front of us was the woman with the kid. Suddenly Susie
    looked down at the floor. <br>
    &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said. &quot;My shoes! I left my shoes at the pizza shop!&quot;
    I looked down at Susie's dirty bare feet and laughed. The shoes she was referring to,
    which were still damp and had wet socks tucked inside them, were an expensive pair of
    Nikes. &quot;I gotta go get 'em,&quot; she said. I told her to hurry, because I was afraid
    we were going to miss the bus. I agreed to wait for her right outside the bathroom.So I
    got to pee, and then I stood outside the bathrooms waiting for Susie to get her shoes. It
    took her forever. At ten minutes to five, she came running back, panting and sweating. She
    got back in line for the bathroom, but now there were four people ahead of her. I stood
    next to her waiting, and I looked at my watch. At 4:55, there were still two people in
    front of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><br>
    &quot;We better go, Suze, we're gonna miss the bus,&quot; I told her. <br>
    She looked at her watch. &quot;Shit,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I really gotta pee.&quot; <br>
    &quot;You'll have to use the bathroom on the bus,&quot; I told her. <br>
    &quot;Shit,&quot; she said again. &quot;I hate those skanky toilets!&quot; I didn't like
    them either, but the alternative at this point was not looking good. We sure didn't want
    to get stuck at the amusement park. As we ran toward the main gate, Susie told me that her
    shoes had been picked up a custodial guy, and that she had to go to a security office to
    pick them up. We got to the bus with just a minute to spare. The driver closed the door
    behind us, and I took a window seat about two thirds of the way back. Susie dumped her
    shoes on the floor. &quot;Got a clothespin?&quot; She asked me. <br>
    I chuckled. &quot;They should keep a gas mask on board the bus,&quot; I said. The bus
    began to move, and Susie headed to the bathroom. But about thirty seconds later, she was
    back at her seat. <br>
    &quot;Shit,&quot; she said as she sat down. &quot;There's someone in there!&quot; I
    giggled as Susie sat down, pushing her shoes under the seat in front of her. &quot;This
    really sucks,&quot; Susie said. &quot;I have to pee, like, soooooo bad. They better hurry
    up.&quot; Susie looked over her shoulder at the bathroom at the back end of the bus.<br>
    &quot;You don't need a clothespin,&quot; I told her. <br>
    &quot;It's guys who need a clothespin. You need a cork!&quot; Susie started to laugh, but
    then! She crossed her legs. &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; she said, pretending to be angry.
    &quot;Don't make me laugh right now!&quot; I wondered if Susie had squirted into her
    pants. I stole a quick glance at her crotch, but everything looked okay there. I was
    getting a little wet myself--but not with pee-it was just thinking about the possibility
    that Susie might be leaking a little bit. I had never seen another girl have a real
    accident. Susie sat back in her seat with her right leg crossed over her left. The bus was
    on the interstate now. I looked out the window at the cornfields, and Susie looked at the
    bathroom door again. About ten minutes passed, and still there had been no movement or
    noise coming from the bathroom. Susie stood up and stared at the door. <br>
    &quot;They better get their ass out of there,&quot; she said, loud enough for people
    around us to hear. <br>
    &quot;What's wrong?&quot; someone asked. <br>
    &quot;She's gotta pee and someone's in there,&quot; someone else said. <br>
    At this point one of the guys who were sitting way in the back leaned over and banged on
    the bathroom door. &quot;Dude! Hurry up! Girl's gotta go!&quot; A few people laughed at
    this, but there was no answer from the bathroom. <br>
    &quot;I don't think anyone's in there,&quot; said one of the girls. &quot;I didn't see
    anyone go in.&quot; <br>
    Susie walked back to the bathroom and turned the knob. It didn't open. She rapped on the
    door loudly. &quot;Hey! Who's in there?&quot; she shouted. No answer. &quot;Shit,&quot;
    she said loudly. She tried the door again, this time twisting the knob back and forth and
    rattling the door. Still the door did not yield, and still there was no response from
    inside. <br>
    &quot;There's nobody in there,&quot; said one of the guys. &quot;It must be locked up.
    Maybe you need to get a key from the driver.&quot;<br>
    &quot;You gotta be kidding me,&quot; Susie said. She quickly walked up to the front of the
    bus and talked with the driver. She came back with a cold look on her face. &quot;This is
    total bullshit,&quot; she said as she sat down. &quot;She doesn't have a key. She said if
    it's locked and there's no one in there, then the lock must be broken.&quot; She tucked
    both of her legs under her, twisting her torso slightly. <br>
    &quot;Oh my God,&quot; I said, laughing loudly. <br>
    &quot;You better stop laughing,&quot; Susie said. &quot;You're the one who got to pee
    before we got on this stupid bus!&quot; By this time, the girls sitting across the aisle
    from us has figured out what was going on, and the two guys sitting in back of us were
    paying attention too. I could hear them talking quietly about the bathroom. My juices were
    flowing full force now! I mean, this was wild! We had almost two hours left on the bus
    before we got back to the college. I wondered if Susie could hold out that long, and
    whether the driver would stop for her. She hadn't made any stops on the way to the
    amusement park, and she hadn't made any announcements. I'm heterosexual, but somehow the
    thought of Susie wetting her pants sitting next to was really turning me on. I sneaked
    another downward glance at her crotch, but it was perfectly dry. I could feel a warm
    tingling in my pussy, and I started to wonder which one of us was actually going to be
    wetter by the end of the trip! Another fifteen minutes passed. Susie shifted in her seat
    again, tucking her left ankle under her right leg, and resting her hands in her lap. She
    began to look really worried. &quot;This is so totally bogus,&quot; she said. <br>
    &quot;Are you gonna be okay?&quot; I asked her. <br>
    &quot;I don't know,&quot; she said, staring at the floor. At this point a girl who was
    sitting near the front of the bus began walking back toward the bathroom. As she reached
    our seat, they guys behind us told her that the bathroom was locked with no one inside.
    The girl stopped and looked at them. <br>
    &quot;Are you guys kidding around?&quot; she asked. No, said the girls next to us, it was
    true. &quot;We have to go too,&quot; they said. &quot;Ask the driver to make a stop.&quot;
    <br>
    No, I thought, please don't do that. I really wanted to see this happen. But the girl
    headed back to talk to the driver. A minute later, the girl looked back at us, shook her
    head no, and sat down. <br>
    &quot;What a bitch,&quot; said one of the girls next to us. Susie began to squirm in her
    seat, slowly but with increasing frequency. She sat cross-legged for a little while, and
    then tucked her left foot under her butt. I could see Erin, the girl directly across the
    aisle from us, watching Susie out of the corner of her eye. She whispered to the girl next
    to her, who I didn't know. She whispered back and glanced at Susie. I thought I heard the
    words &quot;think,&quot; &quot;go,&quot; and &quot;pants,&quot; but I couldn't be sure. I
    wondered how desperate Erin and her friend were. Even I had to pee now, but not very
    badly. I knew I could wait until we got back. While Susie continued to squirm, I
    remembered that the girl up in front had to go, too. I began to think about making an
    excuse to go up front and talk to the driver, so I could look at her. Suddenly, Susie
    squeezed her legs together tightly and bent over. <br>
    &quot;Shit!&quot; she said in a whisper. She sat back and looked down at her lap. I
    looked, too, and it was still dry. &quot;This is bullshit,&quot; Susie said quietly, and
    before I could say anything, she got up and walked up toward the driver. Erin poked her
    head out to watch her go down the aisle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
    she turned to me, grinning wildly. <br>
    &quot;Is she wetting her pants?&quot; she asked me. <br>
    &quot;I don't know,&quot; I said. I figured that Susie must have leaked a few drops into
    her panties, but it still wasn't showing. Erin turned back to her friend, and covered her
    mouth laughing. <br>
    &quot;She's gonna go in her pants before we get back,&quot; she said to her friend. <br>
    &quot;No she won't,&quot; her friend said. <br>
    Erin returned from the driver walking very slowly. &quot;That fucking bitch,&quot; she
    said between clenched teeth. She sat down and crossed her legs again. &quot;She said that
    she couldn't make a stop because the trip is less than three hours.&quot;<br>
    &quot;How much longer do we have?&quot; asked Erin. I looked at my watch. <br>
    &quot;Probably another hour, maybe an hour and fifteen minutes,&quot; I answered. <br>
    &quot;Omigod,&quot; said Susie. She clenched her legs together and bent over. This time
    she stayed bent for a bit longer. Erin and her friend were staring now. Slowly, she sat
    back, let out a deep breath, and stared down at her lap. It was there. A small wet spot
    about the size of a quarter had appeared near the bottom of her zipper. Susie put her
    hands in her lap, covering the spot, and closed her eyes. <br>
    Erin giggled loudly. &quot;Told you,&quot; she said to her friend. <br>
    &quot;No way,&quot; her friend said. <br>
    &quot;She did,&quot; Erin said to her. Erin looked right as Susie and asked her. &quot;Did
    you just wet your pants?&quot; Susie looked at her like she was from another planet. <br>
    &quot;No, I didn't, okay? So just shut up. It isn't funny anymore.&quot; Susie sat back
    and closed her eyes. Erin and her friend continued giggling and whispering, and Susie
    started squirming again. She turned on her left side so she was facing me, and her back
    was toward Erin. Her hands were still in her lap, but I could see part of the wet spot on
    her pants. Her face was red, and the look in her eyes was one of pure panic. <br>
    &quot;Are you all right, Susie?&quot; I asked her gently. <br>
    &quot;No, I'm not,&quot; she whispered to me. &quot;I can't hold it 'til we get
    back.&quot; <br>
    &quot;Yes you can,&quot; I said to her. As her friend, I had to give her some support
    here. &quot;It's less than an hour now. Just think about something else.&quot; But I knew
    she probably wouldn't make it home. She had broken the seal. She started squirming again,
    this time drawing her knees up to her chin. Erin and her friend were looking at her again,
    and they started whispering. Susie lowered her feet to the floor, carefully placing her
    hands in her lap again. &quot;You need to stop thinking about it,&quot; I told her.
    &quot;That's making it worse.&quot; Susie twisted toward me again, turning her back on
    Erin. This time she didn't bother trying to cover the wet spot with her hands. Her eyes
    were moist, and it looked like she was going to cry. <br>
    &quot;I already peed in my pants a little,&quot; she whispered to me. <br>
    &quot;It's okay,&quot; I told her. &quot;Just think about something else.&quot; But it was
    too late. Susie began to squirm in her seat again. <br>
    &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she gasped. She was sitting straight up now, with her left ankle
    tucked under her right knee. &quot;Oh my God, I can't hold it anymore,&quot; Susie
    squealed, and she tried to squeeze her legs together as best she could with her left leg
    crossed under her right. Finally she got both feet on the floor, but the dam had broken.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Susie lost all control, and her pee began to soak
    her khaki shorts. I looked at her crotch, and so did Erin. Erin's friend leaned over to
    see, her mouth hanging open and her eyes wide. Susie's left hand covered her mouth, and
    her right hand lay limp at her side. <br>
    Erin giggled wildly. &quot;Told you she was gonna wet her pants,&quot; Erin told her
    friend triumphantly. Susie stared at her lap, transfixed by what was happening to her. <br>
    &quot;Oh my God,&quot; Susie said under her breath again. The wet spot was growing slowly
    but steadily, spreading slightly upward toward her waistband, and then down the legs of
    her shorts towards her knees. From my own experiences I knew it was also pooling under
    her, and I knew what it felt like. Susie raised one leg up slightly, as if she was trying
    to stop the flow, but then lowered it, apparently realizing that she had indeed lost the
    battle. <br>
    &quot;What in the world are you guys laughing about?&quot; asked one of the guys behind
    us. He was talking to Erin, of course. <br>
    Erin looked at him and giggled some more. &quot;She wet her pants,&quot; she told him. <br>
    &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said. &quot;For real?&quot; He peered over the top of our seats.
    &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he said again. &quot;She sure did.&quot; <br>
    Susie looked at me, and there were tears in her eyes. &quot;I couldn't hold it,&quot; she
    said, her voice cracking. &quot;I couldn't hold it anymore.&quot; <br>
    &quot;I know,&quot; I said gently. I held her hand. &quot;It's okay, Susie. Don't worry
    about it.&quot; Tears were streaming down her cheeks now, and her face was bright red.
    &quot;It's over now, Susie. Just relax. You'll get cleaned up when you get home.&quot; By
    now the whole bus was talking about the girl who wet her pants, about how the bathroom was
    locked, and how the driver refused to stop. People were craning their necks to get a
    glimpse of Susie and her wet shorts. I thought I heard someone say, &quot;Amy did it,
    too.&quot; Susie cried softly for a little while, but she finally stopped and closed her
    eyes When the bus finally rolled into the parking lot at the dormitory, we discovered that
    the girl up front, whose name was Amy, had also wet her pants, but not as bad as Susie.
    She had a damp patch about the size of an apple in the crotch of her shorts, and she was
    laughing about it with her friends. As soon as we got off the bus, about five guys went
    for the bushes, and a few of the girls went running for the dorm. I walked Susie up to her
    room, where she had to deal with her roommate and her roommate's boyfriend. I went to pee
    while she changed her clothes, and then we went out to the courtyard for a cigarette. At
    this point, knowing that another girl had wet herself on the bus, Susie was finally able
    to laugh about the whole thing. <br>
    &quot;You should have worn your sandals,&quot; I told her.</span></font></p>
