    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny closed the door to her room,
    her heart beating. She leaned her back against it, knees tightly together, chest heaving.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">These strange feelings!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The image still in her mind: Lizzie
    wetting herself in class. Eighteen years old, rising from the chair with a sob and a big
    wet patch on her jeans. Hobbling to the door, hands in crotch, a wet wedge up between her
    buttocks.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The class stunned, silent, all
    equally embarrassed for the unlucky girl who had laughed so hard that she peed in her
    pants. Jenny, too. But that sting in her fanny, the instant squeezes to hold, even if she
    didn't have to go to the bathroom. As if there were emotions to hold back.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On her way home, trying to imagine
    what it was like, the stream, the sudden warmth, and the helplessness of it all. She
    wondered if the wee collected in Lizzie's panties, or if they were instantly soaked, or if
    the stream sort of continued under her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">How completely crazy to even think
    thoughts like that! To imagine the growing patch in the seconds before Lizzie's laughter
    turned to crying.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny wished for Lizzie's sake that
    it had never happened. But at the same time it was the most exciting incident she had ever
    witnessed, her legs had turned weak and her fanny throbbed, and she had to keep herself
    from slipping a hand down her jeans under the desk. No boy had ever brought forward such
    feelings in her.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She slid down to the floor, sitting
    with her knees up. She brushed her straight, shoulder-length hair back and mouthed the
    words: Lizzie wet herself in class.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She felt the sting in her fanny
    again. The need to let go and yet to hold at the same time. What would it be like, wetting
    herself?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She thought back to the episode when
    she was ten, running around the corner, suddenly face to face with the Jones's dog. She
    hadn't noticed her soaked pants until later, and then she felt only shame. But there was
    Beth on the beach when they were twelve, saying she had to go, and then wading up to her
    belly, giggling, telling everybody that she was peeing in her swimsuit. Jenny had felt the
    sting then, wanting to do the same. But she didn't need to go, and not a drop passed
    through her bikini bottom.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And there was the tipsy woman last
    year, maybe twenty-something, walking through the park with unsteady steps, stopping on
    the path, lifting her skirt, not bothering to pull down her panties before squatting. She
    had winked at Jenny, saying: &quot;sometimes you just have to go, you know!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The sting again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She looked down at herself,
    imagining a wet spot growing. Lizzie wet herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pulse beat in her fanny and she put
    a hand on herself. What did wet jeans feel like?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Jenny?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She emerged from her dreams and
    answered her mother. &quot;Yes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She poked her head in. &quot;Sorry,
    but I have to work a night shift tonight, starting now. Back for breakfast. Will you be
    okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Dinner on the stove. Sorry
    again. And could you please, please do the washing? I've sorted the clothes, so you just
    put in one heap at a time. Okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;See you, then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny heard the door close. An idea
    formed in her head. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was standing in the kitchen,
    clutching a glass of water, struggling with her reluctant muscles. She had to pee, after
    drinking four glasses, but it refused to come. She pushed, but still some subconscious
    inhibitions kept her from wetting her jeans voluntarily. Was it really that difficult?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She walked back and forth, trying to
    think of something else, but the feel of clothes on her body made it totally impossible.
    She couldn't bring herself to pee in her jeans.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She drained the glass and sat on a
    chair. Maybe that would be easier. Pretend to sit on the toilet, like this, yes, and...
    Nothing. And, of course, the chair would get a stain.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She went into the bathroom, ready to
    give up and do it the proper way. She pulled down her jeans and then stopped, looking down
    at her white cotton panties. She sat on the bowl, trying not to notice the touch of fabric
    on her ready fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Relax. Everything is normal. Just
    having a wee wee. I'm not wearing panties on the loo. I'm...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The sting. And a little easing of
    the muscles, some drops finding their way down, and then a spurt.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She felt warm. She blushed. She had
    wet her panties a little. She relaxed again, this time able to release a bigger stream.
    Her fanny felt glowing hot, and she touched herself. Warm drops on her fingers, the touch
    giving her shivers. Peed her panties.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With unsteady hands she pulled her
    jeans back up, then sat down again, fully dressed on the toilet. Some of the wet had
    seeped through the denim. She concentrated, and suddenly a warm stream flowed freely. The
    warmth spread. Jenny stopped the flow and stood up. Drops fell on the floor. She stood in
    front of the mirror, flushed with excitement, and looked at the round stain on her jeans.
    The sight made her dribble a little, and a dark line grew down her leg. She ran some water
    and filled her glass, drank it all, and refilled. The sound of the tap made her pee again.
    Now she was doing it! Jenny was wetting her pants!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She crossed her legs and stopped the
    flow. Gingerly she turned round, looking at the wet circle on her bottom, and the stripes
    down her legs. She undressed, putting jeans and panties in the correct heaps. The black
    triangle in the mirror was moist, drops hanging from the curly hairs. She wiped herself
    with a towel: Ready again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">White cotton panties with flowers,
    light brown tights, short denim dress; Jenny pulled up a stool and sat down, knees to the
    mirror. Smoothing the dress down to mid-thigh. I can't leave yet, she thought. But I've
    got to pee really badly, and class isn't over. I think I'm going to wet myself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She felt her bladder fill up again.
    Staring at herself she spread her legs, watching her crotch as a dark stain grew, warming
    her butt. She pressed her knees together, pretending nothing had happened. Nothing showed,
    but she knew the back of her dress was soaked. Oh God, she had to let go a little again.
    This time dark stains grew down her thighs. &quot;Miss, I have wet my panties!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She imagined her teacher's voice:
    &quot;Jennifer darling, it's okay. We all have accidents sometimes. Even grown-up women
    pee ourselves occasionally. Just go in your panties if you have to, dear.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny let out a big flow, soaking
    herself completely.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Discarding dress, tights and
    panties, rummaging the heaps again, she came up with a pair of gray running shorts and
    matching top. &quot;I'm almost finished with the race,&quot; she thought, running in
    place, ponytail wagging, &quot;but I've got to go! And if I stop, I won't win!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She didn't know if she could pee
    while running. She relaxed, feeling the pressure, and then small spurts came with each
    step. She saw a dark patch grow, and drops flew from her moving legs. She speeded up,
    pictured the finishing line, and came in first, sinking down to the ground, wetting
    herself uncontrollably. But she had won.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny changed out of the sodden
    shorts, dried herself, and filled the washing machine. From another heap she picked the
    black pants she had worn last Saturday at Beth's party, and the short black blouse that
    went with them. Underneath she wore the same dark red bra and thong panties as then, still
    carrying her faint smell. She turned in front of the mirror, liking the unbroken roundness
    of her butt and the way the pants hugged her crotch. The low cut revealed a hint of dark
    red lace.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She went to the kitchen to get a
    Coke or something, and then put on some music and dimmed the lights in the living room.
    She was back at the party. Drinking Coke she moved around the room, recalling.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She had danced, getting praising
    looks from the boys, and had talked to Beth outside, even though she needed to go to the
    bathroom. Beth had noticed her squirming. She always was so open about these things.
    &quot;Looks like you're about to sprinkle your undies,&quot; she had said. &quot;Come to
    the loo with me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They had locked the door, giggling,
    Jenny crossing her legs; afraid she'd lose control. Beth pointed to the toilet: &quot;Go
    pee, then, before you wet your pants!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny had pulled her pants down;
    noticing Beth's look; and had felt incredibly relieved when the flood came. She had taken
    her time wiping, rising and dressing, feeling the sting again. &quot;My turn,&quot; Beth
    had said, suddenly looking serious. She had lifted her short dress, slipped her blue
    panties down, giving Jenny a glimpse of a large wet spot in the gusset. &quot;Peed a bit
    dancing,&quot; she said. &quot;Happens all the time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The sting.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny had touched Beth's arm:
    &quot;Won't tell anybody.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Beth had given her a hug before they
    rejoined the party. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny opened another Coke and rocked
    a little on her feet. With closed eyes she pictured Beth lifting her dress again. Peed a
    bit dancing. Jenny was full to the brim; she had to hold herself to ease the pressure.
    Peed a bit dancing. She had told Jenny. Happens all the time. Beth leaking into her
    panties. Jenny tried to move to the music, but had to keep her knees firmly together to
    keep from flooding. She took a couple of steps, spun round, and felt warm pee around her
    pussy. Peed a bit dancing. &quot;Come to the bathroom,&quot; she whispered to an imaginary
    Beth. &quot;I just peed in my pants.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Me too,&quot; the voice in her
    head said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Hands between her legs she stepped
    along the hall, seeing Beth beside her, holding herself under the dress. No, holding with
    one hand from the front and one from the back. Jenny dribbled as she walked, not caring
    about the drops on the floor. In the bathroom she pictured Beth going first, not having
    time to remove her panties, just sitting down and flooding herself.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jenny turned to the mirror. &quot;I
    can't wait,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Beth sweetie, I'll just let go in my pants.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She removed her hands.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Look, Beth. I'm wetting
    myself!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Naked, Jenny filled the machine
    again. Time for bed, and with a warm hand working busily beneath her nightdress. Next
    Friday, she'd ask Beth to sleep over. Who knows...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
