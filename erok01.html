    <br>
    This is an absolutely true account of my experiences.<br>
    <br>
    Where to start? I guess the best place to start would be second grade. That was the first
    time that I realized there was something I loved about seeing a girl desperate for a pee,
    or wetting herself. I was sitting in class one day, and a girl sitting a couple seats down
    from me asked permission to go to the bathroom. The teacher said okay, and the girl headed
    out the door. She came back after only a minute or so and sat down. Not five minutes
    later, we all heard a splashing sound. The girl was peeing herself! When the teacher asked
    her why, she said that she had been unable to undo her overalls by herself. I had the most
    amazing thrill, not only from seeing her pee her pants, but also from hearing her explain
    why.<br>
    <br>
    From that point on, I started keeping my eyes open for any and every chance to see
    something like this again. Living in small towns most of my life, the chances are few and
    far between. It was fifteen years before I saw something like that again.<br>
    <br>
    Two years ago, I was on a family camping trip. My brother, our entire family, and myself
    were there. One of the days there, I was heading down to the lake with my wife, my sister
    in law, and her children. On the way down, the girls were going to stop at the bathroom,
    but they were closed for cleaning. My sister in law was a little irritated, but we kept on
    down to the beach. At this point, my attention was on my wife and my sister in law.<br>
    <br>
    As we got closer to the beach my sister in law said something like, &quot;I'm about to
    piss my pants here!&quot; Needless to say, I was thrilled. We arrived at the beach, and
    she sat down on a bench to put sunscreen on her kids. All the sudden, she said, &quot;I'm
    sorry guys, but I am literally going to piss myself right now.&quot; With that, she
    scooted to the front edge of the bench and let loose a torrent through her bikini that
    left an enormous wet patch in the sand under her. I thought I was going to lose it right
    then.<br>
    <br>
    These things aside, I have always worried about someone finding out about my fetish. I
    have issues with self-confidence as it is, and the one time I tried to share this kink
    with one of my girlfriends, it didn't go well. So needless to say, when I met the woman I
    wound up marrying, I was VERY careful about things. She never caught me. However, over the
    past several months, I have found myself almost wanting to get caught. As a matter of
    fact, when I think about it now, she probably noticed a lot more than I thought. This is
    how it finally came out in the open.<br>
    <br>
    I am in the National Guard. That being the case, there are times when I have to be away
    from home for training for a week or two. Now, my wife and I have a great sex life. We
    like to enjoy different things and indulge each other. Just a few days ago, I came home
    from being out of state for close to two weeks. I was exhausted, but wired at the same
    time. She picked me up from the airport; we had a nice lunch, then started the four hour
    drive home.<br>
    <br>
    Shortly after we got home, we headed into the bedroom for some serious lovemaking. Two
    hours and a pint of SoCo later, we finished up. I sat down in the living room for a smoke,
    and got to thinking about my love life. It's great. I couldn't ask for a better partner.
    But I have always felt a little dishonest about not telling her everything when it comes
    to my tastes. So after a few minutes of arguing with myself, I called her out of the
    bedroom; as ready as I could be to tell her the truth and hope it wouldn't push her away.
    An hour later, I still hadn't really told her much. There was a whole lot of stuttering
    and 'Um' and 'Uh' but I just couldn't make the words come out.<br>
    <br>
    I finally gave up on trying to say it and went to the computer. I opened my private folder
    and told her to take a look. Ironic as it sounds, I went to take a leak while she went
    through the folder. I have never been so scared of anything in my life as I was of her
    possible reaction. It was not the reaction I feared.<br>
    <br>
    She said, &quot;You want me to pee on you? You like to pee yourself, what?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Both, and then some,&quot; I managed. At this point, I figured the secret was out
    and just spilled all the beans. A couple hours later, she said, &quot;I'm not sure it's
    really my thing, but I will try it with you and we'll see what happens, okay?&quot; Of
    course I agreed!<br>
    <br>
    What blew me away was the fact that the very next night, she came home from work and
    casually announced that she had a whole package of throw away soaker pads. At that point,
    I decided that she was more than just a little curious about it and I was wondering just
    when we would try one of those pads out. She did not let me wonder for very long.<br>
    <br>
    Just a few hours ago, we were sitting in the living room, and she said, &quot;Come over
    here and kiss me, Baby.&quot; I obliged and the game started. As we headed into the
    bedroom, she said, &quot;Better grab a soaker.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We're going to need it?&quot; I asked. Stupid question, I guess.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Probably.&quot; She didn't need to tell me twice.<br>
    <br>
    I grabbed one, put it on the bed and took my place under her. By the way, I like it when
    she's the one running the show. We got started and were having a great time when she
    leaned down and whispered, &quot;So, you want me to pee on you huh?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh gods yes!&quot; I groaned. She kept rocking on me, and then all the sudden, I
    felt this wonderful heat spreading over my belly and down my sides. She was actually doing
    it for me! No shock, at that point I was in absolute bliss. Within less than a minute
    after that, I had the most powerful orgasm of my entire life. I was on cloud nine. It's
    now a quarter after two in the morning, and I am still blown away by the whole thing.<br>
    <br>
    I can't wait till the next time. After all, who know how far she may be willing to go?'<br>
