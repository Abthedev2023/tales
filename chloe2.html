    <br>
    Robin rocketed out of bed just as her alarm clock exploded with sound. Robin swore,
    checked the time and swore louder. She was late for soccer practice AGAIN and Coach Martin
    would not be so understanding this time. The game was to start in just 10 minutes and
    Robin knew that she'd be very late. Tossing on a sports bra, Robin hurried to the bathroom
    to comb her hair and brush her teeth. She had to pee but figured she could do that in the
    locker room. Besides, she just didn't have the time.<br>
    <br>
    Pulling her strawberry-blonde hair back in a quick ponytail, Robin glanced at the clock
    again. It was 5 minutes to 10, meaning she had just 5 minutes to get to the field, a good
    7 blocks away. Robin grabbed a few sports drinks and crammed them into her backpack,
    briefly checked herself in the mirror and bolted out the door. She hastily ran as fast as
    she could to Mill's Field, her bladder throbbing all the way, where she spotted Coach
    Martin on the field with the rest of the team. Red-faced and out of breath Robin raced up
    to meet them.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Robin!&quot; Bellowed Coach Martin angrily. &quot;You're late!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sorry Coach Martin, I overslept.&quot; Robin apologized, trying to catch her breath.
    She plummeted down on the metal bench, feeling her bladder tense up inside of her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This is the second time in a row Robin, and I warned you. For the entirety of this
    game Robin, you're sitting out.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Robin's face fell. &quot;Yes Coach Martin.&quot; Robin replied, looking shyly at the dirt
    below her. It was a shame; She was already in uniform and everything.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Good, maybe next time you'll learn your lesson.&quot; He snarled. &quot; Are you
    ready team?&quot; shouted Coach Martin in an attempt to get all of the Junior Soccer team
    riled up and ready to play. The entire team cheered in response.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Can I just go to the bathroom Coach Martin?&quot; asked Robin, meekly, knowing she
    would never last the entire game with a bladder this full. Coach Martin glowered down upon
    Robin. She knew her answer. Robin sighed longingly, feeling the pressure mounting in her
    bladder. Coach Martin blew her whistle and Robin's teammates went to take their places on
    the field. Robin watched longingly, wishing she'd get to play. Then again, she was glad
    she didn't have to play, for her bladder was aching, and any sport would definitely
    torture the will of her urethra.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the growing tension just below her abdomen, Robin felt terribly thirsty, as the
    team bench was situated under the authority of the scorching summer sun. Pulling out a
    sports drink from her bag under the bench, Robin drank thirstily, fully aware of how bad
    she needed to pee. However, there was no sense in dehydrating due to a little (okay, a
    LOT) of discomfort and with enough pitiful begging, Robin figured she'd get to go to the
    bathroom if things got urgent enough. Robin casually crossed her legs and squeezed her
    pelvic muscles as she took another gulp of her drink. She just hoped Coach Martin would
    understand.<br>
    <br>
    Robin allowed her thoughts to wander, sitting there under the hot summer sun, nursing her
    drink subconsciously. She was painfully aware of the fullness in her bladder and even more
    aware on how it was rapidly filling to the brim. Clenching her thighs tighter together,
    she swung her knees back and forth, feeling her bladder shift with every pull and push of
    her hip muscles to the rhythm. Robin started on another drink, for she had thoroughly
    drained the first, letting her mind drift to the soccer game, in which she was not
    participating. She got lost for several minutes in the excitement and joy of the game, one
    of her first loves. If only she would have gotten up on time, or not been late the week
    before, if only she had PEED before she had left, then she would not be stuck with a
    bladder that felt like a watermelon inside her body. She watched her fellow teammates play
    with both determination and stealth, and drowned out the heaviness in her bladder. She
    gazed in awe for an eternity, feeling the excitement when her team scored a goal, the
    disappointment when the other team had their small victory, and the anticipation of the
    battle between the two armies. Her enthrallment went uninterrupted until the first trickle
    of urine escaped her labia. Robin gasped, tightening the grip on her thighs until her
    muscles were visibly bulging out of her green vinyl soccer shorts.<br>
    <br>
    It was a short while before the small jet of pee ceased. She buried her red and
    embarrassed face in her hands, praying that it didn't soak through. She felt as if the
    whole stadium knew what she had done, that she had to pee, BAD, that she was DYING to go
    urinate, that she could barely CONTROL it! Robin moaned, a small outlet of her silent
    inner agony, as she lightly palpated her swollen bladder.<br>
    <br>
    Oh god I have to pee!!! She moaned to herself, gritting her teeth. The slight sensation of
    her hand briskly sweeping across her abdomen caused immense pain and pressure. She wished
    she would have stayed home, had she known this would happen, had she known that she'd have
    to go this bad this early, that she'd even be stuck in this position. She'd rather study
    for her SAT's which were coming up in a couple of weeks. Robin regained composure for the
    moment, sighing longingly, knowing that Coach Martin would never let her go, not in a
    million years. Feeling hot, Robin surrendered and took another swig at her powerful sports
    drink. She was growing antsy. She had to pee; she had to pee NOW! The poor girl gasped and
    lurched forward as another spasm wracked her tight bladder, bursting with fluid. Another
    jet of hot urine bathed her labia, as Robin struggled to stem the light flow. By now her
    panties were surely wet, and she was positive that the back of her green vinyl shorts were
    showing signs of distress. If only I could... Robin's brain screamed, as a little more pee
    escaped her lethal grip. Robin observed her inner thighs and sure enough, there was a
    small puddle on the bench by her vagina. Her shorts were wet between her legs and under
    her bottom, where she sat, a prisoner at the bench, and yearning to pee! Her urethra stung
    with longing to release such a burden, her bladder ached and spasmed for relief from this
    terrible punishment (?) called desperation. And poor Robin, the worst subject in this
    scenario had to deal with all this pain, as she tried to retain her dignity, after all,
    almost in college, and here she was, peeing herself in small spurts on her bench. Robin
    removed her hand from between her legs and relaxed her thighs. She vowed to hold it in
    with grace, till the very last goal and beyond. However, all her plans and ideals were
    ditched when the next contraction seized her with such force that she began crying with
    such a need so great. With her legs jammed tightly together, a hand sandwiched in between,
    and Robin, bouncing around like a jumping bean, even that was not enough to stop an
    impending flood as more urine seeped out and began to trickle off of the bench and patter
    onto the dirt below her. At least she was alone on this bench. At least she could struggle
    with her relentless need for relief in private. Robin looked down, assessing the damage.
    The dark areas on her shorts, due to small accidents, had spread a little more; so much,
    in fact, that the wetness was visible at the waistband of her shorts. The moisture was
    creeping outward, so much that it wasn't just being contained between her legs, but
    creeping out to be visible on the front of her shorts as well. She could feel as she
    squirmed around on the bench, that the seat of her soccer shorts was drenched in her
    urgent releases of piss. Robin reached between her thighs, gathering up her shorts and
    forming a wad of wet cloth, as she pushed it against her tormented peehole and sat on it.
    Robin squirmed around on her knot of cloth, and a hard fist, and it helped stop the leaks
    temporarily. But oh, Robin was literally aching for a good piss, and even this mechanism
    wouldn't last forever. More wee began to dribble out all over her hand and shorts, forming
    a week, solid stream, only stemmed by her hand.<br>
    <br>
    This was a valiant battle, and Robin was losing. She had to do something quickly. As she
    returned to her usual, hunched over, 'I have to pee so bad I could hardly move' position,
    a strong gush of hot urine ambushed her hand.<br>
    <br>
    Robin sprang up, letting the pee drain down her thigh. Her eyes darted across the field,
    and she spotted Coach Martin across the area, talking to another coach. Another
    contraction hit her as more scorching pee ran down the inside of her leg. &quot;Ooh,
    ooh!&quot; moaned Robin, bending down to wipe away the dribbles and to ease her hand
    between her legs and stem the tide. From the series and force of minor accidents she had,
    it looked as if she had already peed herself totally. Ironically, she had only skimmed the
    top of the melted iceberg, as her bladder was still full, still aching, still bursting.
    All that pee, both inside and on her... Robin couldn't take it. She dashed for the side
    door; she had to get to a bathroom before she completely lost control.<br>
    <br>
    Safe inside, Robin clutched herself even tighter, as she bent down to wipe the dribbles
    away from her long legs. Her socks were now dampening with her pee. Now where was the
    bathroom? This was not Robin's school, and she barely knew the architecture. She would
    have given up now if she didn't have to pee so badly. She was so wet it looked as if she
    had soaked herself totally, as if there were not another drop left in that aching bladder
    of hers. However, this was not the case--she had to pee something terrible, she had to get
    to the bathroom fast before.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh god I have to PEE!!!' cried Robin to herself, standing among a desolate hall with
    many intersections. She did not know what to do. Pressure increased steadily within her
    swollen bladder, and drew to an alarming level. She felt the first of the last stream
    begin to push it's way out into her soaked panties. Robin knew this was it. She wouldn't
    be able to hold it in much longer. She spied a janitors closet and blindly ran into it,
    distracted and driven by her own frantic need. A trail of pee followed her. Robin
    desperately slammed the closet door behind her. The lights were dim, and Robin madly
    looked around, eyeing several janitor utilities scattered amongst the small closet. Pee
    was running into her shoes now, forming small puddles on the floor. Desperate as all hell,
    Robin eyed the stationary yellow janitors' bucket that's such a staple in any desperate
    girl's last effort in a janitor's closet. She suddenly grew excited at the prospect of
    being able to pee in there. Robin hobbled over to the bucket, and her heart sank. This one
    was full to the brim with dirty grey water. She certainly couldn't pee in that, and boy
    did she want to! By now Robin was completely exercised, could not bear to control herself
    any longer. If she was going to avoid peeing herself entirely, she was going to have to
    think now. The encumbrance of her bladder was getting too high. She felt her urethra burn
    as a threatening gush of preliminary pee signaled an entire flow of pee to soak herself
    more. In one swift movement, Robin's wet shorts and underwear were around her ankles, and
    in another they were off of her body completely. The moment she got herself free of her
    bottom clothing, her bladder gave out and she began peeing a fierce torrent. She barely
    had enough time to get her legs spread to avoid it running down and getting her wet, but
    there was so much pressure behind that first blast that it spurted out straight, hitting
    the wall directly in front of her. Robin knew that she had enough pee, and enough strain
    in her bladder that she'd be able to do that. Robin peed with immense force, and
    eventually the pressure dropped a little and she peed directly on the hard floor beneath
    her. She heard the splatter and felt the reverb hitting against her legs. It felt good to
    let go, after all that time, after all those drinks. The puddle around her feet steadily
    increased in diameter and in volume as pee continued to pour out of Robin. It was nothing
    but relief to be able to let go, and had she been wearing her clothes, it would have been
    considered an accident. Since she was wetting nothing but the ground beneath her, it was
    more like a desperate deliberation.<br>
    <br>
    As the first minute ticked by of Robin's relief, her pee continued to gush out of her with
    bullet force, with unrelenting, desperate energy. Robin never thought she'd get to be
    enjoying this alleviation this quickly, or in this situation. She imagined having to spend
    another tedious hour on that bench and then waiting on the long lines for the bathroom,
    doing a desperation dance, most likely. She imagined wetting herself further, her bladder
    expanding further, the contractions getting more powerful. She would never have made it.
    Lines after games were always hell. Robin shuddered at the miserable thought, and she peed
    harder than ever. The floor of the janitor's closet was entirely wet, and more pee was
    starting to roll its way out from beneath the door. Robin's urethra was already numb from
    peeing, and had she peed for another hour or another second, she would not have noticed.
    All she felt was her bladder quickly deflating, as the additional seconds of great relief
    swept over her body. Her pee was still hitting the cement floor, hard as anything, and her
    bladder still had a small amount of pee left over as well. Robin feared that she'd never
    stop, nor would be surprised if she didn't. She had to pee so badly, she wondered if there
    were days worth of the stuff pent up inside her.<br>
    <br>
    With all her fantasy thoughts, however, she did stop peeing. It took a while before her
    bladder finally decided that it was satisfied and empty, and slowly, her jet stream of
    desperation turned into the slow seeping of avid fluid. And it stopped. Robin stood
    amongst her flood of pee for a second, looking around at her murky surroundings. The floor
    was wet with a giant puddle of the stuff she had fought to keep in just minutes earlier.
    Small droplets of pee still rolled off of the wall. Robin looked at her wet shorts, then
    at her drenched underwear, and sighed with incredible relief. Sure, the shorts would be a
    little jarring by themselves, but the underwear would cling so uncomfortably, and it was
    just too wet. Robin carelessly dropped her soaking panties into the puddle of pee she
    produced, and left them there for some unlucky janitor Monday morning. Carefully, as not
    to get her soccer shorts more wet from the soles of her shoes, Robin put her shorts back
    on and reveled in how smooth they actually felt. Where she had temporarily lost control of
    her full bladder earlier, it felt a little clingy, but the rest of the loose nylon felt
    satiny and wonderful. She looked down at her sopping underwear and giggled a little to
    herself. The battle she had to endure earlier was just a nightmare. With new confidence,
    Robin waltzed out of the janitor's closet, leaving the pool of pee behind. Her shorts
    swished and tugged in the right spots as her hips swayed to her walk. It felt so good it
    gave her goose bumps. Her shoes left prints in urine on the floor as she walked back
    toward the field. She was a little worried that coach would notice her absence, or worse,
    that the team would notice the blaring wet marks over the crotch and back of her shorts.
    But these were things that she could not hide. Was it her fault that she had to pee so bad
    that she had several mini accidents? Was it her fault that the pressure just got so
    intense that she had to dash into a janitor's closet of all places to relieve her
    dreadfully swollen bladder? Of course! Had she not woken up so late, this would never have
    happened. Had she not woken up so late, none of us would have been so entertained for the
    duration of this story :)<br>
    <br>
    Robin slithered back on the bench, unnoticed by anyone. She hoped there was enough time in
    the game to allow her shorts to dry. Luckily, it was still just as hot, and before the
    game was over, her front was completely dried. Her backside was damp, but not discolored.
    She was glad that this whole thing had gone unwitnessed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Robin!&quot; called Coach Martin, running up to meet her. Robin looked up &quot;I
    know this game isn't too exciting for you since you're not playing. But tardiness is a
    punishable offense. Now,&quot; Coach Martin began, considering the options. &quot;Now I'm
    not going to let you play, but I'll let you go a little earlier. However, I expect to see
    you on time for the rest of your career on this team.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Robin thanked Coach Martin graciously, and thought to herself, Now if only I'd have had
    this privilege a half-hour ago!<br>
    <br>
    Robin grabbed her bags and decided to cut through the school to get home quicker. As
    unfamiliar with the architecture as she was, she decided to forage her way through, maybe
    check out her deed in the process. Robin grabbed her bag and filed through the lead door.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hey!&quot; she heard an unassuming voice call out, as Robin shuffled down the main
    corridor. A modest looking, yet attractive man came out of one of the classrooms. &quot;I
    saw what you did.&quot; He said to Robin, and her jaw fell.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Robin asked innocently.<br>
    <br>
    The man smirked. &quot;I saw you running down the hall with piss streaming down your legs
    and wet shorts. I saw you run into the janitors closet.&quot; He began. Robin turned
    scarlet and smiled shyly. &quot;That's not all.&quot; Added the man with an equally as red
    face and an equally as bashful smile. &quot;I waited a while, then I saw some piss seep
    out from under the door. Then I waited a little bit more, and saw you come out. So I went
    in, and found these.&quot; The man held up Robin's wet panties. It was like something out
    of a movie. She hoped she could play the situation like one.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, are you going to tell anyone?&quot; Robin asked, her green eyes pleading for
    mercy.<br>
    <br>
    The man readjusted his slacks. &quot;Miss, that was the single most thrilling moment of my
    entire life. I've never seen anyone have to pee so bad, or pee so much.&quot; He
    complimented. &quot;Can I keep these?&quot; he asked, referring to her soaked panties.<br>
    <br>
    Robin was puzzled, and could not believe anyone could be interested in things like this.
    How he could be so attracted to something she had to endure so difficult? &quot;Sure,
    whatever, how'd you see me though?&quot; asked a confused Robin.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm a new janitor, and I was mopping the floor in a nearby classroom. You probably
    didn't see me; I just graduated from here last year. My name's Steve.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi Steve, I'm Robin. Listen, I kind of have to pee again, can you show me to the
    bathrooms?&quot; Robin asked, as her bladder was now more sensitive than before, due to
    her recent plight<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yeah Robin. Right this way.&quot; Steve said, leading Robin toward the janitor's
    closet.<br>
