      <P class="storyteller">The Hike</P>
      <P> Arriving at the starting point for their weekend camping excursion, 
        the highschool girls unloaded their backpacks and assembled at the trailhead. 
        The youth group was newly assembled from a suburban area, and many of 
        the girls had never been camping before. The leader, Ann Gerlow, had spent 
        quite a bit of time and effort getting them ready for this adventure, 
        including making sure their boots were broken in, and spending a couple 
        of nights in their tents in her back yard, and she foresaw no trouble 
        with this brief foray into the woods. They would hike about 5 miles, make 
        camp for the night, and return the following day. The forecast was for 
        excellent weather. All the girls had the necessary equipment. They were 
        prepared.</P>
      <P
            align="JUSTIFY">They formed into a single file, with the leader at 
        the front and the assistant leader, a college student named Sue Baker, 
        in the rear, and set off along the trail. From time to time the leader 
        would lead them in a traditional hiking song, to boost their spirits and 
        keep the pace steady. The trail was an easy one, with no steep slopes, 
        leading through old forest. The girls enjoyed identifying different kinds 
        of trees and plants, and spotting small animals (and one wide-eyed deer) 
        that they encountered along the way.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">At about the halfway mark, Ann called a halt for rest 
        and refreshment. The girls gratefully unsung their packs and sank down 
        on the carpet of pine needles. They were in good shape, no blisters or 
        chafes, and they chattered happily as they dug sandwiches and drink bottles 
        out of their packs. </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Remember, girls,&quot; the Sue Baker said, &quot;Keep 
        all the wrappers and such. No trash gets left behind!&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mrs. G?&quot; The leader looked down to see a shy 
        redhead.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yes, Sally?&quot; </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Where&#146;s the bathroom?&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Wherever you want it to be, honey &#150; just get 
        far enough from us that we don&#146;t smell it.&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;What? Pee <I>outside? </I>On the <I>ground?</I>&quot; 
        The girl&#146;s eyebrows went up along with the pitch of her voice.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sure, we&#146;re in the woods. All animals do it, 
        you know. There&#146;s no environmental impact in that!&quot; Ann thought 
        the girl&#146;s horror was fear of polluting the environment.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Not <I>even,</I>&quot; the girl exclaimed, &quot;No 
        <I>way</I> am I gonna pee right on the ground!&quot; This was something 
        the Ann hadn&#146;t counted on.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sally, it&#146;s OK. It&#146;s the way everyone 
        &#145;goes&#146; in the woods. If you don&#146;t like the idea of just 
        going on the ground, take one of the little shovels . . .&quot; The girl 
        was shaking her head emphatically.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Uh-uh! I&#146;m not peeing outside, and that&#146;s 
        it!&quot; She turned on her heel and returned to her pack to finish her 
        sandwich. Ann noticed several other girls slipping away into the woods, 
        and thought about suggesting one of them take Sally with her, but decided 
        against it. She had encountered girls reluctant to pee outside before; 
        they usually changed their mind when the need got urgent enough. Speaking 
        of which . . . Ann grinned as she felt some pressure in her won bladder 
        and slipped off herself. She found a tree and lowered her shorts. Lots 
        of practice made it unnecessary for her to stoop. She opened her labias 
        with two fingers, leaned back, and let fly on the tree, reflecting with 
        amusement on the time as a teenager she had won a bet with some male Explorers 
        over whether she could &quot;water a tree&quot; like they did.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">Lunch completed, the area policed, Ann called, &quot;Mount 
        up, girls!&quot; and they formed back into their line to continue the 
        hike. About half an hour later, Sue called for a halt from the rear of 
        the line. Ann turned to see a couple of girls drop their packs and step 
        away from the line, and they didn&#146;t go far enough away to mask the 
        sound. Ann noticed Sally fidgeting and stepped over to her, leaning over 
        and asking her softly, &quot;Why don&#146;t you join them?&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">Sally&#146;s eyes flashed. &quot;I told you, no way! 
        Leave me alone!&quot; Holding up her hands in a conciliatory gesture, 
        Ann returned to the head of the line to await the return of the ones who 
        had needed the break. As they started off again, Ann heard a soft chanting 
        behind her.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sally&#146;s gotta pee! Sally&#146;s gotta pee!&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;All right, no more of that,&quot; Ann called back 
        over her shoulder. She started up a song, wondering how long Sally&#146;s 
        determination would last. They had all used the bathroom before they got 
        into the cars, and it was about two hours drive to the starting point, 
        then about an hour and a half to the lunch break, about another hour to 
        the camp area. She shook her head. Ann herself had held her pee for six 
        hours once, and probably could have lasted longer, but that had been on 
        a bus ride, just sitting there, and she was pretty miserable when she 
        finally got to a place with a decent rest room. Here, they were walking 
        along, and soon they would cross a brook. The sound of running water wouldn&#146;t 
        make it any easier for Sally to continue. Then again, maybe she&#146;d 
        feel better about peeing in the water than on the ground.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">They approached the stream, and Ann called a halt. </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;We have to wade across, or step on rocks, so everyone 
        find the way that&#146;s best for you. We&#146;ll line up again on the 
        other side.&quot; She went to Sally and asked if she&#146;d feel better 
        about going in the water; and got the same curt response. The discomfort 
        was clear on her face, and Jenny, one of the older girls, who had been 
        aware of her plight, said encouragingly, that it was no big deal to pee 
        outside. Then, to Ann&#146;s surprise, the girl dropped her shorts to 
        her knees, half-squatted, and peed in the water. At the distinctive trickling 
        sound, Sally clamped her knees together and leaned forward, her eyes shooting 
        daggers at Jenny. Just as Ann was about to scold Jenny for what she had 
        done, another of the girls, Daphne, did the same thing. Clutching herself, 
        Sally hobbled across the stream, went a way down the trail, and stood 
        hunched, her back to the troop. In time, she apparently regained control 
        and stood up straight, but still held her legs close together.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">Ann turned on the girls who had peed in front of her. 
        &quot;What in the world do you think you&#146;re doing? </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mrs. G, we <I>were</I> trying to help,&quot; Daphne 
        said defensively. &quot;We know she has to go, and we were just showing 
        her it&#146;s nothing to be afraid of!&quot; Jenny chimed in agreement, 
        and from the looks of most of the girls, they agreed that the motivation 
        had been charitable.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;OK, but go easy on her. She&#146;s shy anyway, 
        and this is something she&#146;s never run into before. I just hope she 
        changes her mind before she gives out!&quot; The other girls nodded, some 
        giggled, and they started out again, Sally falling into the line as it 
        passed. Ann didn&#146;t know it, but some of the other girls were still 
        teasing her quietly, making a show of holding themselves and making soft 
        hissing noises Ann couldn&#146;t hear.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">By the time they reached the clearing in which they planned 
        to camp, Sally was walking almost completely from her knees, bent forward, 
        eyes downcast. She was hardly aware of her surroundings, all her awareness 
        overwhelmed by the throbbing, aching feeling of her distended bladder. 
        It would be another 20 hours at least until they got back to civilization, 
        she knew she couldn&#146;t hold on that long, and yet . . . </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">Around her, the other girls began to set up camp. Tents 
        went up, a fire area was cleared, and food and cooking gear were broken 
        out to prepare for dinner. One of the girls, pouring water into a pan 
        to boil, made a point of holding the canteen high over it so the pouring 
        sound was loud and clear. The sound cut through the fog of Sally&#146;s 
        awareness and she felt he sphincter start to relax. Whimpering, she clamped 
        her hands over her crotch and bit her lip. </P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">She was hardly aware of Ann and Sue taking her arms and 
        almost carrying her to the woods, but she was so &quot;clamped up&quot; 
        that their efforts to lower her shorts were to no avail. She let out a 
        sob as despite her best efforts, her urethra opened and sent first a trickle, 
        then a stream, then a gush of pee into her panties, soaking them and her 
        shorts.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Spread your feet, save your boots!&quot; Sally 
        heard Ann&#146;s admonition in time to move her feet apart. The stream 
        cascaded from the crotch of her shorts, only a couple of thin streams 
        running down her legs, to be absorbed by her thick socks. Despite the 
        humiliation of wetting her pants, the feeling of relief was so profound 
        that she moaned in an almost orgasmic way as the pressure that had pervaded 
        her awareness was relieved.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">She opened her eyes and blinked. Ann and Sue were standing 
        beside her, supporting her. She blushed beet-red.</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;Take it easy, Sally. It&#146;s only us, and we 
        won&#146;t tell anyone . . . not even your mom. You&#146;ve got other 
        clothes in your pack, so you won&#146;t have to stay like this. Here. 
        Let&#146;s get it off you!&quot; Sally was surprised to realize that she 
        still had the knapsack on her back. She slipped her arms out of the straps 
        as Ann and Sue lifted it off her and set it down. Ann pulled a roll of 
        paper from it. &quot;Move away from there, get out of those shorts and 
        socks, wipe up, and put fresh ones on. We&#146;ll help you rinse those 
        out so they won&#146;t stink. You&#146;ll be OK. And now you&#146;ve peed 
        outside, it shouldn&#146;t be a problem from now on, right?&quot;</P>
      <P align="JUSTIFY">&quot;I dunno,&quot; Sally murmured. &quot;Maybe.&quot; 
        The leaders left her to clean up. But as she cleaned herself up and put 
        on the dry clothes, she felt strangely triumphant.</P>
