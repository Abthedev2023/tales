    <br>
    <strong>Sister Loraine's Story</strong><br>
    <br>
    Loraine was the nursing sister who had organized the outing. In her late thirties, average
    height with a trim, rounded figure with short blonde hair she was the image of efficiency
    you would expect for a senior nurse. On the outing she had been wearing a rather short,
    tight-fitting fawn skirt.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Everything went really well all day until the last hour, when it was difficult to
    get some of the nurses out of the pub, and we were late leaving. The driver started
    complaining about having to work late, an attitude which annoyed me, so I rather abruptly
    told him that if he turned up in St Luke's A &amp; E needing treatment, he would expect us
    to work overtime if needed, so he could do the same for us. He shut up then, but was
    clearly still far from happy. Another five minutes and we were away, and I could not
    resist telling him he had been making a big fuss over a measly ten minutes. By then we
    were most definitely not friends.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;After about 20 minutes, I wanted to go to the loo. All the fuss with the driver; I
    hadn't realized how much time had passed since I had last been- before I started trying to
    get the nurses out of the pub, and when we actually left. I really should have gone back
    for another, last minute precautionary pee just before we left, but that would have upset
    the driver even more. I had been drinking lager shandy all night, as I thought that I
    would not get drunk if I stuck to a high volume drink. Most of the nurses had been
    drinking lager or beer, as it was cheaper, so I wasn't going to be the only one who needed
    a loo. After the row with the driver, I dared not ask him to stop so all I could do was to
    cross my legs and let someone else do the asking. I wasn't desperate, just uncomfortable,
    and it was a matter of putting up with the discomfort for a bit longer.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot; My bladder seemed to be filling up at an alarming rate, so in the next twenty
    minutes I went from just being uncomfortable to wanting to pee really badly. I had crossed
    my legs really hard and I kept telling myself that I had to wait longer, which I could
    easily, but in some discomfort. When it came to it, I had no choice, if I could not ask
    the driver to stop, then I had to wait until someone else did. There had to be others,
    particularly some who had drunk more than me, who wanted to pee more than I did, and
    surely one of those would soon be asking the driver to stop at a loo. With luck most of
    the drink had already gone through me, so I hoped that I would not get much more
    desperate. I asked myself whether I really could last out the whole journey if we didn't
    stop, and I thought that I could if I really had to. I crossed my legs as tightly as I
    could and leaned back in the seat to put the minimum pressure on my bladder.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;After another quarter of an hour I wasn't so sure I would be able to wait all the
    way. I was just getting steadily more and more desperate, so even though we were less that
    half way back, my condition was becoming really serious. My legs were crossed as tightly
    as it was physically possible to do so, and on top of this I was clenching my bladder
    shut. I could actually visualize my thighs and pelvis all squeezing together to keep the
    outlet from my bladder shut. I could not remember when I had last wanted a pee this badly,
    but I told myself that I had no choice but to hold out a bit longer. My stomach was
    starting to ache, which was another symptom of how badly I wanted to go. I could not
    believe I was the most desperate on the coach, and if the other younger nurses could wait,
    then I could as well. I had quite a reputation at the hospital for having an iron bladder,
    and also for being intolerant of nurses who wanted the loo between their breaks, so I did
    not want to be seen as the first to want to go. In fact, I was absolutely determined that
    I would not be the one to initiate a stop, my image of a strict Sister would not allow me
    to.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I tried to see where we were, so as to know how much longer I would have to wait if
    no one made a move. When I realized how far we had to go, I did start to worry. It was
    going to take at least another hour and a half to reach St. Luke's. I didn't want to think
    about having to hold out that long, and for a moment I thought of going to go up to the
    driver to ask him to stop, then I checked myself. No, I could not be the first girl on the
    coach to need a loo. I was a senior Sister, so I had to set an example to the nurses. I
    was also proud of my bladder control, so it wasn't going to be me who admitted they had
    drunk too much and had to stop the coach for a loo. What if the driver just pulled into a
    lay-by, could I let everyone see me squatting by the coach? The thought of this was worse
    than my need for a loo, and gave me strength to hold on a bit longer. I knew that I was
    not the only one to want a loo, nor could I be the worst. What I could not understand was
    how anyone could be much more desperate that me and not be begging the driver to
    stop.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I looked round the coach, trying to see who else looked desperate. There were quite
    a few girls with their legs crossed, but no one stood out as being really bad. Was
    everyone the same as me, trying to hold on until someone else stopped the coach? My
    stomachache was becoming worse, and I knew it was due to the pressure in my bladder. This
    was a classic symptom of a bladder reaching the limit of its capacity, the start of the
    time when the bursting pain eventually became so bad that you could no longer stand
    holding it back. Worse, I could see I was starting to bulge in the bladder region, even
    with a tight skirt to hold it in. For that to happen, my bladder had to be stretched,
    distended, almost to the limit. The thought that I might actually let go and wet my
    knickers was inconceivable; I had to hold on, because surely we had to stop soon. I kept
    telling myself that other nurses must want the loo even more than I did, and that they
    were on the verge of stopping the bus. If I could just manage to wait another five minutes
    we would stop. I looked at my watch, and told myself that if nothing happened in five
    minutes, I could think of asking the driver to stop.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Nobody did make a move, but also I was still managing to hold on, so I stopped
    myself thinking about being the one to ask for a stop.<br>
    <br>
    My bladder ache was becoming agony, the bulge noticeably bigger, and I was certainly
    willing squat by the coach and pee just so long as we stopped as soon as possible. I tried
    leaning forward a bit, both arms across my bladder, which helped a tiny bit, but also make
    my condition more obvious. I would wait another five minutes, even ten perhaps, and by
    then surely we would stop. If not, perhaps I could make some excuse about feeling sick to
    get the driver to stop and still preserve my iron bladder image. The sheer need to pee was
    becoming so desperate that going was becoming the only thing I could think about.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Somehow I survived the next ten minutes, and even though I wanted to pee even more
    by then, I was still just about managing to hold it back. I could not understand why
    nobody else seemed to want a loo. How could anyone be anywhere near the state I was in and
    not ask about a stop, unless they had some reason to try and wait. If I wasn't a senior
    nurse, and had not had that row with the driver, I would have been asking for a stop some
    time ago. I was reaching the point when I began to wonder what would happen if we did not
    stop, either because no one asked, or the driver refused to stop when asked. If my kidneys
    kept on working as they had been, then a ruptured bladder was a real possibility. Or would
    my sphincter just give up and I wet myself? I really did not want to find out which would
    happen. Never in my life had I ever wanted to go anything like as badly as this. All I
    could do was to tell myself to wait another five minutes and we might stop anyway. How
    many times had I told a nurse that she could easily wait a bit longer if she tried? My
    words were coming back to haunt me now, and I had to do what I had always told others to
    do.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Then, at last the miracle happened! Two young trainee nurses hobbled up to me, both
    crossing their legs, one almost doubling over while she talked. Sure enough, they were
    desperate for a pee, they simply had to go, they said, almost in tears, it was an
    emergency, could the coach stop? I was saved! I told them to tell the driver, as no
    specific stop had been arranged, but that he would stop as soon as someone wanted
    to.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I had expected that the driver would stop almost at once, but he kept going for at
    least another ten minutes. He was looking for a proper loo, and was not going just to stop
    anywhere. Did he know how desperate some nurses, including me, were? Thinking we were
    going to stop had made me want to go even more, and I had to fight with all my strength to
    wait. I was not alone in my agony; I could see one of the two trainees was doubled over,
    both hands pressing between her legs. I was more than ready to go almost anywhere as long
    as it was not too public, and would not have had any problem going by the side of the
    road. I was about to go and tell the driver this when I saw a sign for loos, and then the
    actual building next to the lay-by that we were stopping at. Because of this, I was third
    off the coach, after the two trainees, who were almost climbing out the window by then,
    just taking time to announce there was a toilet stop if anyone needed to go.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There was no pretense any more. The other two were running for the ladies', both
    holding between their legs, and I would have done the same except that my skirt was too
    tight to let me hold myself and my bladder hurt too much to be able to run. A fast hobble
    was the best I could manage, so the next group had caught me up as I got to the ladies.
    There were only three cubicles, two were already taken, and I just had to get into the
    last one. No manners, no pride, nothing mattered except getting into that loo instead of
    having to queue. I just made it. Shaking with desperation, I was frantically tearing my
    clothes out of the way so I could pee. Oh the relief! My poor swollen bladder could relax
    at last. I just peed and peed and peed; I thought I would never stop, I didn't think it
    was possible for anyone to hold so much pee. No wonder I had been desperate, my bladder
    must have been close to rupturing, it was so full. I ignored cries of 'Hurry up!' and
    banging on the door from the nurses outside, I just had to let it all out, even if it took
    10 minutes, and it felt as if it did, I was going for so long. It felt wonderful to be
    able to relax after being so desperate for so long.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The scene in the loo was incredible, so many desperate nurses, some holding
    themselves, some almost fighting to get into a cubicle. A couple of them were in tears and
    holding themselves with both hands, they were so desperate, but nobody would give way and
    let them go first. One older nurse had pulled her skirt up and was peeing into the sink.
    She was actually peeing through her knickers; she didn't seem to care so long as she could
    pee. I think she had wet herself trying to run to the ladies, and nothing mattered to her
    except going as soon as possible. Other nurses were so desperate that they were using the
    cubicle in the gents, or even squatting round the side of the loo, as they had not been
    able to wait in the queue. Seeing what a state they were in made me regret my stupid pride
    and not taking the initiative earlier and organizing a stop. Well, I had suffered as much
    as anyone, and there was no lasting harm done, though I am sure I wasn't the only one with
    an aching stomach, caused by an over-stretched bladder, all the way home.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Author's note:<br>
    <br>
    I think that Loraine agreed to tell her story mainly to show off her tremendous endurance
    at holding her pee and not saying anything, always hinting that she could have held on for
    another hour if she had had to. Once she had agreed to be interviewed, it gave the venture
    an official seal of approval, and encouraged the other nurses to tell their stories.<br>
