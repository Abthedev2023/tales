    <br>
    Well today was an interesting day.&nbsp; I have been really busy in meetings and <o:p></o:p>such, and
    have drunk a bit of coffee - but had no time for the loo! I finally got out of one meeting
    before lunch, and was bursting so bad it hurt - I am amazed I had not peed myself yet.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I raced by my desk to grab my purse and then the problem started - the fire alarm went
    off.&nbsp; We were advised to immediately evacuate our floor because of <o:p></o:p>a &quot;possible
    fire&quot; on the level above me. I am on level 18, so it is a long walk!&nbsp; I also
    could not go and pee because the toilets were the opposite direction from the fire stairs,
    and they were pushing people out...<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    I finally got downstairs with a few little runs, and then they &quot;directed&quot; us to
    the assembly point to ensure we were all there.&nbsp; By now I was basically leaking a
    little with every step, but really had no choice but to follow!&nbsp; There was nothing I
    could do except walk or squat where I was (with half of my building walking past me).<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    We got to the park and were told to assemble, and while in the middle of everyone I had to
    let a little go - I was really embarrassed, but no one noticed (I don't think).
    &nbsp; Finally, after ages, we were allowed to go back to our desks - but I knew I would
    not make it at all.&nbsp; So I went and stood near a bush with my legs a little apart, and
    let it all go - right through my panties and stockings. Damn it felt good.&nbsp; I had to
    give my panties a bit of a rub to stop them from dripping (there were still a few people
    around - I wonder what they thought I was doing with my hand up my skirt?) and then had to
    go through another 2 hours of meetings with my soaked panties.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    It turned out that the fire alarm was false in the end, too!&nbsp; Some idiot tried to
    have a smoke in the men's room and set of the alarm.<o:p></o:p><br>
    <br>
    But in the end I must admit that while I was scared as anything whilst everyone was
    around, I really did enjoy doing a full pee in the park with all my clothes on, and then
    spending the next 2 hours all wet...<o:p></o:p></span><strong><br>
