    <br>
    <br>
    This story is one of my fantasies (based on some fact) but is not meant to be in any way
    disrespectful to the very real problem of bullying in schools.<br>
    <br>
    Making my way to the ladies' room I saw them, three girls standing in the hall, their
    uniforms the same as mine, but that's where the similarity ended. My name is Mary. I
    attended my local school, but even at 18 I was still being bullied- by Heather and her two
    cronies.<br>
    <br>
    I had refused to give them any money or CDs and they wanted to push me. Heather called me
    over and I went timidly pulling my blazer over my dark blue pleated skirt (ballerina
    length) and white blouse.<br>
    <br>
    Suddenly I had a thought. Anything is better than the insults and pain so I increased my
    leg movements and said in a nervous voice &quot;I'm really sorry Heather, I'll pay next
    time.&quot; She glared at me, her lovely cold eyes taking me in. &quot;Can't we do this
    later, I want to go in there, we have algebra.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Heather was about to allow me through when June said, &quot;She's a senior, Heather.
    Remember that Prefect that almost made you pee your panties last year?&quot; Heather
    flushed and then seemed to notice my discomfort. &quot;I think we would be remiss in
    hurting you Mary, let's get on. Hurry, you don't want to be late!&quot; She guided me from
    the ladies' room. I stammered and said, &quot;It's double algebra, and I need to go before
    class!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Quiet!&quot; she snapped. &quot;You will hold it until I say, or would you rather be
    hurt?&quot; I looked downcast but inside I was smiling. The only down side was that I
    really did have to go.<br>
    <br>
    Heather held me across the shoulders as we walked; her hair smelled of pine trees, then
    she broke contact at the door to the class, but gently. I took my seat, aware of my need
    while crossing my legs and taking the chance to lean forward when smoothing my skirt. A
    double period of algebra meant two sessions of 40 minutes. This was going to be
    uncomfortable but I have been desperate before- like what girl hasn't?<br>
    <br>
    Time passed while Claire and June giggled as my leg crossing became more pronounced. The
    nervous tension of the situation was taking a toll and I was getting antsy. That was how I
    spent the first period, fidgeting and trying to work. Finally the bell rang and Miss
    Campbell said, &quot;Ok, anyone who wants to go to the toilet can go now, but be back in
    five minutes.&quot; I let my hands fall into my lap and pushed down as I got up.<br>
    <br>
    Heather caught my eye and she simply glanced at my chair. I arranged my skirt and retook
    my seat, slowly crossing my legs and chewing my lip. No acting now, I really needed to go
    to the bathroom. Claire and June giggled and said under their breath, &quot;Does baby need
    to leave the room? Please Miss, can I be excused?&quot; They were horrible, but Heather
    moved her lovely red hair and gave me a look of sympathy, I thought.<br>
    <br>
    The next 20 minutes were agony. I squirmed and danced trying not to let anyone know I was
    nearly wetting myself since I was afraid to go to the ladies'. After another few minutes
    with my hand pressed into my lap I had to ask. I went to raise my hand. Heather glared at
    me but with a half smile and I lowered my tentative hand.<br>
    <br>
    I tried to wait some more but started to get very scared, I'm 18, I can't just pee in my
    uniform. Looking at Heather, she just shrugged. Raising my hand I asked to leave the room,
    thankfully the teacher said yes. Heather, quick as a flash said, &quot;Me too, miss&quot;
    and followed. In the corridor, Heather lead me to the stairs. &quot;What about the ones on
    this floor?&quot; I blurted out, by now I was crossing my legs every few feet.<br>
    <br>
    Heather put her arm around me and we sat on a bench, as there were a number of these
    littered around the school dedicated to this and that. I found myself leaning into her. We
    sat for a minute or so with me leaning against Heather while my squirming turned into a
    rigid gentle rocking. Finally she said &quot;come on and lead me to the ladies,&quot;
    which were thankfully on the same floor and she stopped just inside the door. Moving from
    foot to foot I said, &quot;Please heather I'm going to...&quot; She looked sad and stepped
    back. I stopped left hand pressing hard between my legs through my skirt. She was looking
    at the floor, her eyes hooded by her full lashes. Shivering with need I went over to her.
    &quot;What?&quot; I said. &quot;You let me hug you!&quot; I smiled and curtsied. She took
    my hand and said, &quot;Go to the toilet, then go home, I'll tell the others that you got
    wet.&quot; I made to go to the cubical but turned around. &quot;Heather,&quot; she looked
    up and I came forward and kissed her. She fell back a few feet with her hand pressing
    between her legs as she needed to go a bit too, &quot;what are you...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I leant on the sink and held myself again. Heather recovered and grabbed me and kissed me
    hard as hard as Peter White had at the school dance. I was smiling when she stopped and I
    said &quot;this in the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me, but I really must
    pee now!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    It was at this point when June came in. Thinking quickly I said, &quot;Pretend to tickle
    me!&quot; Heather recovered quickly and put her hands to my sides, &quot;no hurting, just
    tickling, how bad is that?&quot; she growled.<br>
    <br>
    June came forward and took over. She was not kidding as Heather had been, so I begged her
    to stop and crouched on the floor crying. I could not hold it any longer (I was almost
    dribbling back when I was talking to Heather) and broke free, making for the cubical.
    Suddenly I started to go. Not just dribbles and spurts but full on. I just froze, hand on
    my crouch, piss pouring down my legs through my clothes. Strangely the only thing I could
    see was Heather now had started fidgeting her legs in the way I had about a half hour
    before. I was soaked and dripping. The teacher was called and I was lead in shame to the
    school nurse. They sent someone to take me home- it was Heather. She smiled and moved from
    foot to foot.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I have to take you home,&quot; she said. Heather's skirt was shorter cut than mine
    and it was clear she had not yet gotten to pee since my accident some 30 minutes ago.
    &quot;So, come on, the bus is due!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The bus was 10 minutes late. Heather never went to the loo until she got to my place, sort
    of...<br>
