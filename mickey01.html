    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It is my pleasure to share this
    experience with you. It's one that I wish I could live over and over again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of months back I was
    joining one of my neighbors in celebrating her birthday. She had planned to have a limo
    take a bunch of us into the city to go to a club. Sounded fine to me. It was a horrible
    night out weather wise though. It had been pouring rain since early in the afternoon and
    showed no signs of slowing. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The bunch of us included two other
    guys, five girls, all of who were very attractive, I must say, and myself. So off we
    headed, the city was about half an hour from our apartments. The drive on this night was
    taking a bit longer due to the heavy rain. On our way there I noticed some of the girls
    whispering about how badly they had to pee. We were still about 15 minutes from the club
    and I was also noticing my own need to pee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    had been drinking for an hour or so beforehand and I hadn't gone to the bathroom yet. The
    beers were starting to take their toll, but at least it wasn't just on me. Two of the
    girls seemed desperate to go as well. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another ten minutes passed as we
    continued our conversations. I was doing my best to concentrate on a conversation with my
    neighbor Casey in order to draw my attention away from the need to pee. As we got into the
    city we hit a bit of traffic to further slow things down. For the couple of minutes before
    that I had been keeping my eye on Kendra who was sitting directly opposite of me and had
    gotten a bit quiet over the past couple of minutes. She had crossed her legs tightly and
    was leaning forward with her arms folded across her waist. When she noticed the heavy
    traffic she got a worried look on her face. I knew she must be getting very desperate. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We finally got to about half a block
    away from the club. Kendra was squirming constantly with her arms still folded across her
    waist. She asked if we could get out right here with a hint of desperation. It was still
    raining out so Casey told Kendra to hold on another second till we got right in front of
    the club to hop out. Kendra was really looking worried. A minute later we finally got
    there and Kendra was the first out of the door urging us to hurry along. She rushed right
    to the door and paid her cover and dashed in. I was in a hurry because I, too, had to go
    bad. I made it in not too far behind her but I couldn't find her. Forget that, I was about
    to have an accident myself. I quickly rushed to the men's room where I was able to whip
    out my cock just in time before I started squirting into my pants. Thank God. I was so
    disappointed I didn't get to see Kendra fight to get to the bathroom. When I got back out
    I saw her already at the bar with the girls. I checked her pants out and they showed no
    signs of dampness. Damn...she had made it. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now-fast forward to about 3 A.M. for
    the ride home. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We had all been drinking a lot while
    celebrating Casey's birthday and now it was time to go. I made sure I used the bathroom
    before we left so I wouldn't have to worry again about my own urge on the way home. The
    two other guys had already left with one of the girls, so that just left me with Casey,
    Kendra, Erin, and Kathy for the ride home. Towards the end of the night I had been keeping
    my eye on the girls to see who had been using the bathroom and none of the girls, except
    Erin, had used the bathroom in the last hour at least. I spotted the limo outside and
    reminded the girls the limo driver would leave if we weren't there at 3 A.M. sharp. It was
    about 2:57... perfect timing. I urged to girls to pay their tabs, which they did, and we
    were off. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We all hopped into the limo and I
    was sure that someone would get desperate on the way home. I got more than I hoped for. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We had all been drinking beer pretty
    heavily through the night, mixed in with some shots of liquor. I was just waiting for the
    beers to do their work. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Through the first fifteen minutes no
    one showed any signs of a need to pee. Then Casey, who was again sitting next to me, broke
    the ice. She turned to me and asked me how far we were from home. I took a look at the
    road and told her about twenty minutes. &quot;Fuck....<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I hope we get there fast, because I really gotta go&quot;, she whispered.
    Now this really got me turned on. I had been hoping to see Casey get desperate the most of
    all the girls. She was so hot- about 5'5&quot;, blonde hair and just a perfect body. I
    mean perfect. She was wearing a tight white button down top with tight black pants. She
    had taken her purse and put it over her crotch with one hand underneath, I'm sure she was
    squeezing herself. This was making me hard. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Not a couple minutes later the other
    girls were laughing and carrying on when Kathy stopped laughing and quickly crossed her
    legs tightly. Her laughter stopped with it and now she began to look worried. Could she be
    getting desperate also? I got my answer when she turned to Kendra and I heard her mention
    how bad she needed to pee. Kendra told her to shut up and not talk about it, it was making
    her want to go as well. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Meanwhile Casey had gone pretty
    quiet. I asked her if she was OK, &quot;Yeah, I'm fine I guess. We had just better get
    home soon, I'm totally bursting.&quot; These words alone almost made me cum in my pants. I
    was going to sit back and enjoy the last ten minutes of this ride. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of minutes later Casey was
    getting restless. She was constantly shifting in her seat. I know that the other girls
    noticed, but they didn't say anything, they were struggling themselves. The rain outside
    had to be making it horrible. It was pouring down on the top of the limo. The sound of
    rain can make a fight to hold it unbearable. I loved the sound of every drop. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">About two minutes to go and Casey
    was now holding herself with both hands. She was taking deep breaths through her teeth and
    moaning things to herself. I kept trying to assure her she would be fine, although I was
    hoping for the opposite. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When we got to about a couple blocks
    away Kendra leaned forward and asked Casey if she could have her keys. She explained that
    she had to go so bad that she wanted to run in and be the first one to use the bathroom.
    Reluctantly Casey got out her keys and gave them to Kendra. I heard Kathy mention to
    Kendra that she had better make it quick because she had to go just as bad. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What a situation- three girls on the
    brink of wetting themselves and just one bathroom. I assured myself I was going to see one
    of them have an accident, and hopefully it was going to be Casey. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As the limo pulled up both Kendra
    and Kathy went first out of the door and ran towards the apartment, with Erin right behind
    them. I don't know if she had gotten desperate too or just didn't want to get wet from the
    rain. Whatever it was I didn't want to miss it. I quickly paid the driver and turned to
    Casey, &quot;Alright Case, we made it. Let's go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mikey hold on a sec...&quot;
    She was grabbing herself tightly. &quot;God, I feel that if I move that I'll lose
    it.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Come on, I'm here with you.
    We'll make it,&quot; I said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I don't think I can wait until
    Kendra and Kathy to get out of the bathroom though.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was almost crying, tears in her
    eyes. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well, how about we make a dash
    to my apartment. You can go there without having a wait,&quot; I said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She agreed and after a couple of
    more squeezes she got up and got out of the limo. Not more than five steps she quickly
    stopped and bent over, squeezing herself with both hands. I grabbed her arm and said,
    &quot;Come on Case, your almost there.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    began walking again, without unlocking her knees. She was holding on with all she had. The
    rain was still pouring down. We got about 20 steps from my door when it happened and she
    couldn't hold it any longer. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Tears rolling down her face she
    froze, &quot;Shit!!...Shit!!... God no!!! Nooo!!!!&quot; She turned from me and reached
    around with her hand and grabbed her ass. I watched in awe as the pee slowly began to
    trickle down her left leg. She tried squeezing her legs together as tight as she could but
    she couldn't stop it. The piss began to hiss against the crouch of her pants. She finally
    put both hands up on the wall; bent over, spread her legs and just let go. She sighed
    loudly at the relief she must have felt. She peed hard for over a minute. All the beers
    had finally made their way out. Both legs were totally soaked, a huge puddle at her feet. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she finished she turned to me
    with a face full of tears. &quot;It's okay Case...let's get you inside and dried off. You
    can change into something in my place, the other girls don't have to know.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Although I bet they had a struggle of their own. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I got Casey into a pair of old
    sweats. The other girls called over to see what was up. I explained it was nothing and
    that we would be right over. When Casey showed back up at her place wearing my sweats the
    other girls knew. But to Casey's surprise Kathy came out of her room and told her not to
    worry and that she had had an accident herself. The two hugged and laughed at each other.
    No big deal. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I would have loved to see Kathy lose
    it as well. But for now I'll have to savor the image of Casey wetting her pants. Hopefully
    more stories to come!<o:p></o:p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
