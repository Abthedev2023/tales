    <br>
    I'm not quite sure why I'm telling you this story; I guess if someone enjoys it I'll feel
    a bit happier about what happened.<br>
    <br>
    So here goes....<br>
    <br>
    I'm Katy, I live in Cornwall, I'm about five and a half feet tall with shoulder length
    dark hair, and people often say I look a bit like Posh Spice.<br>
    <br>
    I turned 19 a couple of weeks ago and as an extra special treat for my birthday my mum
    took me to New York on a shopping spree (I'm so spoilt!!)<br>
    <br>
    On the morning of the trip I had a couple of coffees and a bowl of cornflakes with lots of
    milk -yum!<br>
    <br>
    We set off in good time to get to Heathrow, I was sipping my water bottle as we made our
    way up the M4 when suddenly near the Chippenham junction the traffic ground to a halt, it
    looked like there was an accident ahead, we were crawling along and I needed a wee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mum can we stop at the services, I need the loo?&quot;<br>
    &quot;No problem Katy the next services are at Membury, its only about 30 miles
    away.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Well, it took nearly an hour to get to those services.<br>
    &quot;Katy it's another hour till Heathrow, if we stop we might miss check in&quot;<br>
    &quot;Oh okay mum I can wait&quot;<br>
    <br>
    We finally made it to Heathrow but by the time we got a parking space we had to dash to
    make check in, we did with about 5 minutes to spare, by now I was really looking forward
    to a wee.<br>
    <br>
    &quot; I'm just off to the ladies' mum.&quot;<br>
    &quot;I think we should clear customs first, there's a long line at security.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mum wasn't joking. It took ages to clear customs and by the time we got through I was
    dying for a wee and was trying to hold myself subtly by putting my hand in my jeans
    pocket.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We need to get to the gate urgently, Katy!&quot;<br>
    &quot;Mum, I'm bursting. I need a wee first.&quot;<br>
    &quot;We need to get to the gate, they will have a loo there.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    We got to the boarding gate just as they were starting to board the plane.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mum, I need a wee desperately,&quot; I whispered urgently, trying to hold on without
    squirming.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;You will have to wait until we are on the plane!&quot;<br>
    &quot;Mum, I'm busting. I can't wait that long...&quot;<br>
    &quot;Well, you'll just have to. There's nowhere else.&quot;<br>
    &quot;Oh God. I can't hold it. I can't! I have to pee right now!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oh God, was I desperate!! So close to wetting myself I was almost in tears. I was 'holding
    on' with all my strength and it felt as if I was right on the brink of wetting myself. <br>
    <br>
    We got to the plane and started climbing the stairs to board but in my predicament I
    missed my step and stumbled.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>&quot;Oh no. Oh no please God, nooooo...&quot;<br>
    I slammed my hands into my crotch but it was no good, my hands were getting wet- warm and
    wet.<br>
    I froze in shock, staring through my tears as a dark wet patch expanded around the crotch
    of my pale blue jeans, spreading rapidly up my bottom and over my inner thighs.<br>
    The dark area spread down my legs as I stood there and wet myself, pee collecting in my
    timberland boots and dripping down the steps behind me.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh for f*** sake Katherine I can't believe you did that, now what are we going to
    do, you stupid girl?&quot;<br>
    I just stood at the door to the plane with my Miss Sixty jeans still dripping wee.<br>
    <br>
    An airhostess appeared and took me to one side.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Uh miss have you been drinking, I can't let you fly if you are drunk.&quot;<br>
    &quot;She's not drunk, she just wet herself like a stupid baby,&quot; my mum snapped.<br>
    &quot;Well, I can't allow you to sit on our seats in that state, do you have anything to
    change in to?&quot;<br>
    &quot;All my clothes are in the hold luggage.&quot;<br>
    &quot;She's 19- I didn't expect to have to bring a change of knickers for her!&quot;<br>
    &quot;Shut up mum you aren't helping.&quot;<br>
    &quot;I'll see if I can get some pyjama trousers from the first class sleep packs.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The stewardess promptly returned with the pyjama bottoms and a plastic bag for my wet
    jeans and knickers, I went to the loo to change and poured about a pint of pee out of my
    boots.<br>
    <br>
    I made my way timidly to my seat having just gone through the most embarrassing moment in
    my entire life.<br>
