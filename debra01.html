    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">My name is Debra and I&#146;m in England. I am in my
    late 20s.<br>
    <br>
    Yesterday I really needed cheering up, something to distract me for a while, so I drank as
    much tea and water as I possibly could. Then I put on a mid- length blue skirt with my red
    silky shorts, and underneath those, I wore a pair of brand new dark blue lace knickers as
    well. I walked into town, as there were several things that I needed to do - go to the
    post office, take a prescription in, etc&#133; By the time I got into town I was bursting
    to pee, but I ignored it and carried on with walking about the town. I was in agony but
    enjoying it, though I had to keep stopping continually and I must admit that when no one
    was looking I had to hold myself. It was so bad that I thought my bladder would explode.
    Knowing that I was wearing those silky shorts excited me greatly. I was in a department
    store when I felt a warm trickle down my leg. Oohhh, it was exciting but I didn&#146;t
    dare to flood the shop due to the security cameras in there. So with every ounce of
    strength I could muster, I crossed my legs and managed to stop the flow. My shorts and
    panties were a bit wet but nothing was showing and it felt wonderful wearing them. Very
    carefully I made my way out of the shop, and I do mean carefully, since I couldn&#146;t
    walk properly; I had to concentrate on holding my pee inside as I was on the verge of
    totally wetting myself and I knew it. I made it to the door but just the effort of opening
    it caused a little more pee to escape and run down my leg; this time the urgency was
    greater than ever and to stop it I had to physically hold myself quite firmly. I did
    notice some strange looks in my direction, but I honestly didn&#146;t care! (At the time
    you really don&#146;t care, it&#146;s only when things are all over that you might feel a
    little embarrassed.) A kind man held the door open for me, I thanked him and staggered
    outside, with my shorts feeling wonderfully wet. I didn&#146;t want to flood such a public
    place, but I wasn&#146;t confident that I had a lot of choice in the matter, really. I was
    wondering frantically what to do, then realized that I was fairly near the park. So,
    getting more and more desperate with each step, I headed for the park, as it should have
    been fairly empty as usual during school hours. Somehow and I still don&#146;t know how, I
    made it to the park, and indeed, it was empty just as expected, so I allowed myself to
    relax a little. I also allowed myself a good hold, which feels wonderful with wet silky
    shorts. Oohhhhh, I was close to cumming as I stood in the empty park and rubbed myself.
    Then without warning, my bladder just gave way and the pee poured out of me like a river.
    I thought it would never stop, and words alone can&#146;t tell you how damn good it felt,
    I was so turned on and relieved that I just stood there in my puddle and rubbed myself to
    orgasm in my wet shorts and pants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I have just gotten in at this minute and I
    hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed reading, writing, remembering and of course
    doing it.</font></p>
