    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Did I scare you?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Perhaps you think all lesbians are
    squat and ugly and angry. I'm not. Please keep reading.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I saw you on your first day at work,
    standing nervously at the reception desk, twirling your hair and squeezing your legs like
    you needed the girls' room. I loved the way the silk in your pantsuit fell over your
    beautiful bottom, and the waves in your dark hair. I was the girl with the ponytail who
    passed you from behind and turned to look at you. But then everybody else did too, I
    guess. I wore black pants and dark red blouse. You probably didn't notice.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Have you ever been in love with
    another girl?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was about twelve the first time.
    She was fourteen and a friend of my sister's. Had long hair and cute breasts, and she used
    to braid my hair occasionally. I loved the touch of her hands and the way she sat behind
    me with legs around me. One day she told me a guy had kissed her, and I asked what it was
    like. Like this, she said, and kissed me full on the mouth. I nearly wet my pants.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ever had sex with a girl?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ever touched another girl between
    the legs? Stroked her breasts, fondled her hair, kissed her on the mouth? I fell in love
    with you the first time I saw you. I wanted to stroke your face, kiss your lips, cup your
    pretty breasts in my hands, hold your narrow waist, and press my longing sex against
    yours. The next day I dressed as prettily as I could, with my tan pants and matching top,
    and my hair hanging free, hoping you would notice me. All day I hoped for a glimpse of
    you, passing by my desk. You smiled, and I had to touch myself under the table. Your dress
    was lovely. The hint of lace on your bosom, the way your cute belly rounds under the
    fabric.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I need the little girls' room. Will
    you come with me? We could giggle and laugh and swap lipsticks, and I would brush your
    hair back. Then you can watch me pee. I love the intimacy of going to the bathroom
    together. God, I have to go.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sorry for the delay. No, of course
    you don't notice that, reading. But I just had to wee, or else. I imagined you beside me
    in front of the mirror, maybe dressed in the yellow blouse and the tight jeans, and I had
    to press my hand between my legs to keep from weeing. Actually- no.&nbsp; Yes. Actually I
    dribbled a little, from pure lust. I had to step quickly into the cubicle, pull down the
    side zipper, wriggle my pants down, then slip my panties down, and sit before I lost
    control. The relief!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Have you ever wet yourself?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It happened a lot when I was a
    little girl. Always waited too long, from carelessness. Sometimes even for the thrill.
    Could I make it in time? The fullness gave me a strange tingling between my legs, and if I
    wet myself - oh, the shame and joy at the same time. The last time was only a few weeks
    ago, on my way home. I was wearing a dark red corduroy boiler suit, and was kind of
    desperate before boarding the underground. I was pacing, crossing and uncrossing my legs,
    feeling the pressure build. Finally the train came, and stepping up nearly made me pee my
    pants. The urge grew, and I shifted in the seat, sitting on one buttock, wanting to clamp
    my hands between my legs. I counted stations, feeling my swollen pussy lips against my
    panties. My nipples grew hard. On standing up I felt a little go in my panties, but I
    managed to hold on. Then came the walk home. Each step a poke in my bladder, the movement
    of the fabric a constant stimulation of my sex. The boiler suit made it impossible to
    squat between cars -not the easy lifting of a skirt, but the total removal of the garment.
    Waiting at a red light I stopped caring and just held myself. One street further I gave
    up. Standing on the pavement I let the warm wee flow, soaking myself completely. Sharon,
    twenty-six years old and a big girl, peeing herself on the street, dreaming of you.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Do you pee in the shower?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I pee in the bathtub. I bring a book
    and a lot of tea, and when I feel the need, I just let go. I stroke myself and then pee
    when I come, thinking of you. I wish you were in the tub with me; we could wash each
    other. Maybe I could shave you. I imagine your naked pussy under that dress I just saw you
    in. I imagine you in see-through panties, in leggings, in jeans. I imagine you in my bed,
    waking with your arms around me. I imagine you saying, Sharon, I need to pee. I imagine me
    answering, Monica darling, just go ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My name is Sharon and I'm a lesbian.
    Will you be my girlfriend? <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    Yes. Monica!) <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
