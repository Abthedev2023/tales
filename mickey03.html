    <br>
    After my adventures with April over Christmas break on the roads I began getting hungry to
    see girls desperate to pee. I began plotting ways to get my girlfriends into situations
    where they were at the brink with no restroom at their disposal. I know that sounds evil,
    but it has become such a turn on for me. <o:p></o:p></font></span><p class="MsoPlainText"><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of weeks back one of my
    plans worked out better than I had thought it would. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It all started one week when a
    girlfriend of mine from work, Pam, asked what I was doing over the weekend. I replied that
    I had not much in mind but suggested that maybe we could catch a movie or something. She
    sounded interested and asked me to call her with plans. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of days later I scanned the
    movie listings and saw that Lord of the Rings was playing. This grabbed my interest
    because my friends had seen it and told me that it was close to three hours long. I called
    Pam to see if she was still interested, and she was. She also mentioned that she wanted to
    invite her roommate and another friend along if it wasn't too much trouble. Fine with me,
    maybe I could relive the situation that I had with Casey and her friends. I told Pam to
    invite her girlfriends along and be over at my place by 8:00. I planned for us to play
    some drinking games beforehand and go to the late show at 10:30. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The night of the movie rolled around
    and Pam and her two friends, Lisa and Jen, arrived with her. The came prepared with their
    own beers to play some drinking games beforehand, and it seemed that they had already been
    drinking some before they got to my place. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I was very pleased to meet Pam's
    friends. All were attractive with fit bodies. Lisa was wearing tight jeans and a tight
    navy sleeveless sweater, accenting some cleavage. Jen was wearing tight khaki capri pants
    with a skintight dark red shirt. Pam was the real gem, with her DD breasts. She hardly
    ever wore tight clothing at work, but tonight she too was wearing a tight top with her
    breasts pushed tightly together with tight fitting jeans to boot. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The stage was set; I was optimistic
    and hopeful to see some wet action later in the night. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The girls made themselves at home
    and I opened a drink to join them. We sat around a table talking and not too long after
    started some drinking games. Jen and Lisa seemed like real party girls and they weren't
    drinking shyly. The girls were handing out drinks in a vengeful fashion amongst themselves
    in our games. The drinks were going down very rapidly. I began to wonder if they were
    gonna want to go to the movie at all, they might be too drunk. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After about an hour the girls began
    to use the restrooms. Jen took a pee almost every fifteen minutes. Lisa used the bathroom
    once to my records and Pam I hadn't seen go at all. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At about 10:00 I asked if they still
    wanted to go to the flick and they decided to go. Lisa was actually really excited to see
    the movie, saying that she had read the books a long time ago or something. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Before we left all three girls used
    the restroom. That made things appealing to me, because as most of us know, that once you
    break the seal when you are drinking that usually makes you want to pee very often. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We left and got to the theater in
    plenty of time. As we entered the theater I led the girls to four remaining seats located
    in the top far corner (this was planned). I planned that when the show let out that we
    would be the last ones out of the theater, and that a line would already have formed at
    the ladies room by the time my girls arrived there. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We got seated and the previews began
    to roll. I had Pam sitting to my right and she had Jen and Lisa next to her. Not five
    minutes into it Pam excused herself during the previews for the restroom. Jen and Lisa had
    gotten a large coke for them to share and I had gotten one for Pam and I. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I'll skip ahead to about an hour and
    a half into the movie. Pam had probably drunk about half of our coke and had been getting
    restless over the last five minutes. I began to wonder about her and the others. Surely
    they had to be feeling somewhat of a need to pee by this time. I had even begun to feel a
    need, having gone only once at my apartment. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maybe ten minutes later Pam was
    shifting in her seat when she leaned my way and moaned. I asked her what was wrong,
    &quot;Oh nothing, I just gotta pee again. How much longer do you think this is?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, I think the listing said
    it was 2 hours...so maybe just another fifteen minutes.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That was a total lie. It was probably going to be
    close to another forty-five minutes. I strapped myself in. My attention was totally off
    the movie and onto the girls. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maybe ten minutes later I noticed
    all the girls whispering to each other. I tried to catch what they were saying. I stared
    out of the corner of my eye as Lisa buried her hands in her crotch and rolled her eyes at
    Pam. Jen was sitting with her legs crossed tightly, as was Pam. Pam was actually having
    trouble sitting still, adjusting herself every minute or so. Some other girls in the
    audience were getting up and leaving to use the restroom and I know the girls had noticed,
    probably wanting to join them, but too shy to get up and scoot across the aisle in the
    middle of the ending.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of minutes later Pam leaned
    over to me, &quot;God, is this movie going to end soon? We all have to pee so bad!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Music to my ears! I looked at my watch and there
    was probably five to ten minutes left. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So, maybe eight minutes later the
    movie ended. As soon as the first credit rolled Lisa shot up out of her seat. Pam and Jen
    also got up quick and Pam nudged me to hurry up and exit. Just as I had planned we got
    stuck behind everyone and were going to be the last ones out of the theater. Pam was
    standing directly behind me and I noticed she was running in place and moaning under her
    breath, &quot;Come on...come on...&quot; I loved the feeling of her huge tits pressing
    against my back as she kept trying to push me ahead. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We eventually made our way into the
    hall where we were greeted by more moviegoers. It seemed that maybe three to four movies
    were letting out at the same time. As we moved ahead I caught a glimpse of the ladies room
    line, which extended into the hallway, as I had thought it would. When Pam finally saw the
    line she cussed under her breath and grabbed Lisa by the hand as they entered the long
    line. Jen joined them as they waited, each doing an obvious pee dance. I stood back in the
    hall and watched; my plan was working to my amazement. As I was standing there I again
    realized my own need and I skipped into the men's room. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When I returned back into the hall
    it seemed that the girls hadn't moved forward at all. I looked at Pam as she rolled her
    eyes at me. I raised my hands as if saying, &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Pam said something to the girls and headed
    into the bathroom, I suspected probably to plea with someone to let her go ahead in line.
    If that was the case if didn't work. Pam came back out a couple of seconds later with a
    worried look and said something to the girls. After that they all got out of line and came
    over to me. Pam said, &quot;The ladies room only has four working stalls and the line is
    hardly moving. Is there anywhere else to go around here?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Gosh Pam, I don't think there
    is anywhere open at this time of hour. Do you girls think you can hold it until we get
    back to my place?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That very question made Lisa double
    over. All three moaned in agony. Pam made a decision, &quot;Come on guys, let's hurry, I
    think I can make it. Lisa, do you think you can hold it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I think so&quot;, she replied,
    with an element of doubt. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With that we rushed out to my car.
    Lisa and Jen piled in the back of my Jeep and Pam took shotgun. We encountered more
    traffic while trying to leave. All three girls were dead quiet. Jen kept kicking the back
    of my seat while she was shifting in her seat. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This was like déjà vu with the
    girls during Casey's birthday. The signs were the same and surely someone wouldn't make
    it. I would be happy to see any one of these girls lose control. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A couple of minutes from my
    apartment and Lisa began moaning very loudly. &quot;Come on Lisa, hold on just another
    minute, we are almost there!&quot; cried Jen in encouragement. Pam crossed her legs
    tightly and leaned forward. She looked as if she was about to cry. I wasn't by any means
    going as fast as I could and Pam took notice, &quot;Mikey hurry!!! We all really have to
    go!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Guys, please let me go first
    when we get there!!! I'm about to fucking wet my pants!&quot; Lisa cried with extreme
    desperation. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We pulled into my lot and Pam jumped
    right out. Lisa was pounding at the seat because Pam had to pull it forward for her to get
    out. Lisa had her hand buried deep into her crotch and was breathing heavily. Jen was
    basically climbing on her back as they jumped out of the back. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We half sprinted to my door as I
    fumbled for the keys. Lisa stood next to me and froze as she doubled over buried both
    hands into her crotch, &quot;Ohhhhh...no, no. I'm going, open the door!&quot; Lisa stood
    up as I saw her crotch was wet. She undid her jeans button as I opened the door and
    unzipped as she passed me. Lisa bolted in and straight towards the only bathroom in my
    apartment, straight across the living room. We all had a view as she ran to the door and
    kind of whiffed in her attempt to close the door. It closed halfway and I got a nice view
    as she yanked down her jeans and panties and fell on the toilet. I heard the pee begin the
    hit the water immediately. She looked over and realized the door hadn't shut all the way
    and that we all were watching, &quot;Jen, please close the door for me!&quot; Jen rushed
    over and closed the door while saying, &quot;Lisa!! Please hurry up, ok!!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jen closed the door and bent over
    with her hand also buried in her crotch, while pacing about in her major pee dance. Pam
    stood next to me and crossed her legs while pacing about the apartment. I just stood back
    and took it all in. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A minute later Lisa was still in the
    bathroom and Jen opened the door a crack and yelled at Lisa, &quot;Lisa come on, finish
    up! I'm wetting myself!!&quot; Jen stood there doubled over with her back to us and began
    to also unzip her pants. Finally she busted the door wide open as Lisa was zipping her
    pants back up. Jen entered the bathroom and Lisa came out. Apparently Jen locked the door
    behind her, I guess not wanting Pam to barge in on her in the same manner. Pam went over
    to the door and bent over with her hands buried in her crotch now too. Lisa stood there
    and began rubbing Pam's back, &quot;Hold on just another second babe...you're gonna make
    it too.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as she finished the
    sentence Jen flushed the toilet and Pam let out a yell. She squeezed her legs together
    hard and reached around her hand to grab from behind. I watched as some pee let out and
    ran down the back of her legs. I almost came at that point; it was so hot!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pam tried to open the door but found
    it locked. Lisa began pounding on the door, &quot;God, Jen!!! Open the door! Pam is going
    in her pants!! Open up!!&quot; Pam began to sob as she continued to try the door. We heard
    Jen screaming back, &quot;Pam!! Hold on, I'm almost done!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I continued to stare as a little
    more pee ran down the back Pam's legs. She stood up and said, &quot;Screw it!! I'm going
    out on your patio Mikey!!&quot; She ran over to my sliding glass door and unlocked it at
    the handle and tried to pull it open. It wouldn't open for her as she continued trying to
    pull it open. What she didn't realize is that I keep a stick lodged in the tracks to keep
    to door from being opened by intruders. Pam tried the lock again and again tried to pull
    it open with no luck. She turned with tears on her cheek, &quot;Mikey!!! Why won't this
    open?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I ran over and removed the stick
    and Pam doubled over and crossed her legs hard. Just as I pulled the stick out of the
    tracks Pam lost it, &quot;OHHHH!!!!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>God!!
    Shittt...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pee began to pour down the front and
    back of her jeans as I pulled the door open for her. She ran out onto the patio and froze
    as she tried to stop the pee. She couldn't. It began to come out in such a torrent that it
    hissed against the crotch of her jeans. She stood up and unzipped her jeans and turned
    sideways to me as she yanked them down and squatted in the nearby grass. She left her
    white panties up as the pee continued to just completely flood through them with such a
    force. Pam was crying hard as Lisa came out and consoled her. I went back inside as Jen
    came out of the bathroom. Jen went out to the patio and joined them outside. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I waited inside when a few minutes
    later Lisa came back in, &quot;Sorry about that Mikey, I don't think she got any pee on
    your rug. She wet herself pretty well so we are going to take her home. Thanks for
    everything, and sorry once again&quot;. I told her not to worry about it and to tell Pam
    not to be embarrassed. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Lisa turned and left. I ran straight
    into the bathroom and jerked myself to a hot cum in less than a minute. I have found a new
    love in girls wetting themselves. I am so fortunate to have witnessed these accounts over
    the last six months. I hope more is to come!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
