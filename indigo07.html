    <br>
    Sam took Jenny by the hand, and led her into the house. &quot;Would you like to take a
    bath while I run your wet things though the washing machine?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny sniffed, wiped a tear from her eye with the back of her hand, and nodded meekly. So
    Sam led her upstairs and into the bathroom and began to run a bath, adding copious amounts
    of bubble bath. The sound of the water gushing into the tub was almost enough to make
    Jenny lose control and completely wet her knickers a second time, but she fought hard
    against the urge and just about managed to hold on. A couple of short leaks escaped, and
    she felt the pee gently dribbling down the inside of her thigh, but it was such a minor
    accident that Sam didn't even notice it.<br>
    <br>
    When the bath was full of steaming, bubbly water, Jenny took off her bra and her sodden
    knickers and stepped into the tub. Sam stooped to pick up both pieces of Jenny's underwear
    and disappeared through the bathroom door, calling &quot;I'll just pop these in the
    washing machine&quot; over her shoulder. When she had gone, Jenny sank down into the warm,
    soapy water, and promptly peed the remaining contents of her bladder. She knew she
    oughtn't to do this - that she ought to wait until she had finished bathing and then use
    the toilet properly, but her bladder wasn't willing to play that game and she hadn't the
    strength of will to fight it. Not today. Not now. Normally, she would have been dreadfully
    upset to lose control in the bath in this way: but she was still so utterly mortified
    about her earlier accident that she really couldn't care less about one more minor,
    private humiliation.<br>
    <br>
    She lay back in the bath, her eyes closed, still sobbing gently, and replayed the events
    of the afternoon in her mind. She counted the opportunities that she had had to say
    &quot;Can I just use your loo please, Sam: I'm bursting for a wee.&quot; There had been
    seventeen of them! Seventeen opportunities to ensure that she wouldn't wet her knickers,
    and she had fluffed every single one of them and ended up peeing herself like a little
    girl twenty years her junior. How pathetic was that? And she cried some more.<br>
    <br>
    Sam came back into the bathroom. &quot;Don't cry, Jenny,&quot; she soothed.
    &quot;Accidents happen from time to time. Everyone has them, you know. And nobody need
    even know about it except us two. Once your pants are washed and dried they'll be as good
    as new.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How soon will that be?&quot; asked Jenny. &quot;I really ought to be on my way as
    soon as I can. I haven't even started to think about my supper yet.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ah,&quot; said Sam. &quot;There's a slight problem there. You see, the drying cycle
    on my washing machine has broken down, so your pants and bra will have to hang out on the
    line to dry overnight. Don't worry, though. I thought you could stay the night here with
    me. After all, you're hardly in any state to be sent home, are you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny thought about this for a while. &quot;What about Marcus?&quot; she asked.
    &quot;Won't he mind?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Marcus need never know about it,&quot; said Sam, conspiratorially.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But you said he'd be back about six!&quot; protested Jenny. &quot;He's due back any
    minute. He might even find me still lying here in the bath.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Actually,&quot; corrected Sam, &quot;I said he was usually back at about six. But
    he's in Singapore on business right now, so I don't think we need worry about his coming
    back home tonight, do you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Jenny, and lay back in the bath to ponder the significance of this
    new piece of information.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now,&quot; said Sam brightly. &quot;You get out of that bath and towel yourself dry,
    and I'll find you some fresh pants to put on. I don't think my normal pants will fit you,
    but some of my Baby Sam things should fit. After all, the plastic pants did. You don't
    mind, do you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny shrugged. She didn't have much choice in the matter. Her own underwear was in Sam's
    washing machine and wouldn't be dry until the following morning. So it was a case of
    wearing some of Sam's baby things, or going without underwear altogether. And she wasn't
    exactly keen on the idea of going without, so that was that.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny got out of the bath, and was still toweling herself dry when Sam reappeared and
    handed her a pair of knickers. They were candy pink flannelette, with a picture of a teddy
    bear on the front.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Marcus sometimes insists I wear the training pants over a nappy,&quot; explained
    Sam, &quot;so they ought to fit you OK.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny regarded the knickers skeptically for a moment or two, then shrugged and pulled them
    on. They were only a pair of knickers, after all; and nobody was going to see her wearing
    them except Sam. And Sam had just admitted that SHE wore them with a NAPPY underneath - so
    she was hardly going to think it odd that Jenny was wearing such a garment. The fit was
    pretty good, too, and the feel of the flannelette against her skin strangely reassuring-
    just what she needed after her humiliating experience earlier that afternoon. She looked
    around the bathroom for the rest of her clothes; but they weren't there. Her knickers and
    bra were in the washing machine, of course (why HAD Sam washed her bra as well as her
    knickers, she wondered) and her dress was still down on the patio by the swimming pool.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sam,&quot; she said, &quot;could you be an absolute angel and fetch my dress for me?
    I think it's still out by the pool.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam hesitated, as though she were wondering whether to say something or not, and then
    turned to go.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What is it?&quot; asked Jenny. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; said Sam, &quot;I was just wondering about something. But I'm not sure
    it's fair to ask you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ask me what?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; continued Sam, &quot;it's like this. You look really cute like that in
    my teddy bear training pants. And when I play games with Marcus, I only ever get to be
    Baby Sam. I never get to play mummy. So I was sort of wondering whether, well, I suppose I
    was thinking that perhaps you might like to try on some of the other clothes rather than
    have your dress back.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Try on some of the other clothes?&quot; asked Jenny, a little dubiously. &quot;Like
    what?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; explained Sam, &quot;there's a romper suit that would probably fit you.
    And then we could play Baby Jenny. And I'd get to be mummy for once.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny was torn between conflicting emotions. One part of her mind screamed &quot;NO! DON'T
    DO IT! IT'S WEIRD! WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! SICK, SICK, SICK!&quot; But the other part of her
    mind said &quot;Why not?&quot; She was feeling a little bit emotionally fragile right now;
    but the training pants felt warm and reassuring, and being looked after by
    &quot;mummy&quot; might feel warm and reassuring too. Might be just what she needed
    tonight, in fact. And &quot;mummy&quot; was her old best friend from college days, after
    all, not some unbalanced stranger she'd never met before.<br>
    <br>
    The second part of her mind was certainly getting the better of the argument, but there
    was one thing that was still worrying her. Something that Sam had said earlier about the
    games she played with Marcus; something that made her fear further humiliation. Because
    she didn't think she could take any more humiliation, even if Sam was the only one who
    knew about it. Indeed, she doubted she could take any further humiliation today even if it
    was entirely private and nobody but herself ever knew about it.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If I agree to be Baby Jenny for you,&quot; she finally said, a little hesitantly,
    &quot;you won't make me wet my knickers again, will you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh Jenny, Jenny, Jenny!&quot; exclaimed Sam in a mummy voice, smothering her with an
    enormous hug and holding her tight against her bosom. &quot;I know you're upset that you
    had an accident, and of COURSE mummy doesn't want you to have another accident. We'll work
    together to make sure your pants stay dry for the rest of the day. You just tell me the
    moment you think you need a wee, promise?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And Jenny, already beginning to slip into role, nodded her head and said
    &quot;Pwomise!&quot; before sticking her thumb into her mouth.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now Jenny,&quot; said Sam, &quot;what would you like to wear for the rest of the
    evening? Shall I fetch your romper suit?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny nodded and took her thumb from her mouth. &quot;I'd like that.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    So Sam dressed Jenny in her romper suit, which was lemon yellow with little white bunny
    rabbits on it, then took her down to the kitchen to cook her tea which consisted of fish
    fingers, baked beans and oven chips. Then, when Jenny was sitting at the table with her
    tea in front of her, Sam asked: &quot;Would you like some Ribena to drink with that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ribena! Jenny hadn't drunk Ribena in something like twenty years; and she'd never really
    liked it even then. But realising that the role-play probably required her to want to
    drink the stuff, she nodded enthusiastically. She was, however, a little taken aback when
    Sam placed an enormous spouted plastic cup on the table in front of her. It must have held
    about a pint and a half of the sweet blackcurrant cordial.<br>
    <br>
    Sam registered Jenny's surprise, and explained: &quot;It's a normal child's drinking cup,
    scaled up to take account of the fact that you're a little bit bigger than the average
    child.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Oh,&quot; said Jenny.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now come along - eat up all those baked beans and drink all your drink, or you won't
    get any ice cream for after.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    So Jenny played her part, and ate all her food, and drank up all the Ribena, and Sam
    rewarded her with a huge bowl of ice cream. As Jenny began to tuck into it, she also began
    to feel the first early warning signals from her bladder, telling her that she might need
    another pee soon. She knew from past experience that, after trying to hold on for a long
    time, she normally needed to go again soon afterwards; and all that Ribena she had just
    drunk couldn't be helping. And she remembered that she'd promised to tell Sam the moment
    she felt the need to wee again; yet at the same time, she knew that if she asked to go to
    the toilet now her ice cream would start to melt while she was away.<br>
    <br>
    She tried to think in role. What would Baby Jenny do? Tell mummy she needed the toilet, or
    eat the ice cream? Put like that, it was a no-brainer: Baby Jenny would eat the ice cream.
    Even though she'd had an accident earlier in the day and didn't want to have another one?
    Yup- even though she'd had an accident earlier in the day and didn't want to have another
    one.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny like ice cream!&quot; she declared, smugly, and tucked in.<br>
    <br>
    By the time she'd finished the ice cream, she was beginning to feel distinctly
    uncomfortable in her bladder. Now was probably the time to tell mummy that she needed to
    go wee-wee. But mummy was busy clearing the dishes from the table. Mummy wouldn't want to
    be disturbed now. So Baby Jenny slipped off her seat onto the kitchen floor, and crawled
    over to the basket on the floor by the radiator where she started to stroke the sleeping
    cat.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Does Jenny want to help mummy wash the dishes?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Baby Jenny liked to help mummy. Baby Jenny nodded enthusiastically, and scampered over to
    the sink.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Do you want to wash, or wipe?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny wanna wash!&quot; And she plunged her hands into the warm dishwater. Which
    immediately made her feel MUCH more desperate for the toilet. Indeed, she very nearly
    started weeing there and then, and only just managed to hold it all back. Oops. That
    wasn't meant to happen, was it? Still, there were only a few more dishes to do. She'd
    finish the washing up, and then tell mummy that she needed the toilet.<br>
    <br>
    As Jenny stood doing the last few dishes, her urge to wee grew more and more intense. She
    crossed one leg over the other and squeezed her thighs together, and she bit her lip in
    intense concentration as she struggled to keep control of her bladder. She bit so hard
    that she tasted blood, which made her whimper a little.<br>
    <br>
    Sam heard her whimper. &quot;Jenny darling, what's wrong?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny need wee-wee.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam looked at her friend, and was immediately struck by her posture. Legs crossed, thighs
    clenched; bending forward slightly at the waist. She was absolutely desperate.
    &quot;Jenny,&quot; she remonstrated, &quot;you promised to tell me the moment you needed a
    wee. And look at you! You're absolutely desperate, aren't you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny nodded. &quot;Sowwy, mummy. I didn't mean to leave it so late.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, run along quickly before you have another accident. Can you manage on your
    own, or do you need me to come and help you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can manage,&quot; said Jenny.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, run along then, Jenny dear,&quot; said Sam, giving her a quick little pat on
    the bum. &quot;Quickly!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny scampered off to the toilet, cramming both hands into her crotch as she did so to
    control the strong urge to pee, which overcame her the moment she started to move. Halfway
    there she thought she'd left it too late and was about to wet herself. She stopped dead
    and wrapped one leg around the other, and squeezed hard. She bobbed up and down a couple
    of times, and the urge eased a little. She held tight with both hands and scampered on.<br>
    <br>
    It wasn't far to the toilet, and to her intense relief Jenny was still dry when she
    arrived- but there wasn't much time if she was to avoid a second, humiliating accident.
    She closed the door and locked it behind her, hobbled over to the toilet with faltering
    steps, and went to lift her skirt.<br>
    <br>
    Only she wasn't wearing a skirt. Or a dress. She was wearing a romper suit. And she hadn't
    paid any attention when Sam had put it on her, so she hadn't the faintest idea how to take
    it off again. She was gripped by a momentary panic, which saw her lose control for long
    enough that she felt a dribble of pee escape into her knickers. The flannelette knickers
    were absorbent, however, and it didn't run down her leg or soak through to mark the romper
    suit. She managed to hold the rest of her pee back, but she realised she didn't have long.<br>
    <br>
    Crying in anguish, she turned round and hobbled back to the door, opened it and yelled
    &quot;MUMMY! MUMMY! MUMMMMEEEEEE!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Sam came running. &quot;What's the matter, darling?&quot; she asked, just as Jenny finally
    lost the battle with her over-filled bladder. For the second time that day Jenny felt the
    pee escaping from her despite everything and gushing into her knickers. Felt the warm
    sensation between her legs as it soaked into the candy pink flannelette. Then, a moment or
    two later (and this sensation was new) felt the warm rivulet of pee trickle and dribble
    its way down the inside of her thighs, down the stretchy fabric of her romper suit,
    wetting her knees, her calves, her ankles, her feet and finally pooling in a puddle which
    spread around her feet.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'm sowwy mummy,&quot; sobbed Jenny. &quot;I couldn't undo my womper suit, and I
    couldn't hold on any longer. Is mummy vewy cwoss with Jenny?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No darling,&quot; soothed Sam. &quot;Mummy isn't cross with Jenny.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;But Jenny's had another accident.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I know darling, I know. And Jenny wouldn't have had another accident if she'd told
    mummy as soon as she needed a wee, would she?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny shook her head sadly. &quot;But my ice cweam would have melted.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam tutted. &quot;Which is more important to Jenny, ice cream or dry pants?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny want to be dwy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Then Jenny will have to try just a little bit harder, won't she?&quot; said Sam
    reproachfully.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny nodded, and started sobbing again.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Come along, sweetheart. Don't cry about it. Let's get you cleaned up, and let's just
    try a little harder to keep dry in future shall we?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny nodded, but still she cried.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll tell you what,&quot; said Sam, &quot;would you like some more ice cream?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny perked up at this and nodded enthusiastically.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well,&quot; said Sam, &quot;you stay dry until bedtime, and you can have another
    bowl of ice cream. How does that sound?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny stopped crying and nodded even more enthusiastically, so Sam took her up to the
    bathroom and ran another bath for her. She took away her wet clothes and mopped up the
    floor of the downstairs toilet, then returned to the bathroom with a pair of white floral
    print flannelette training pants and a pink flannelette nightdress with a teddy bear on
    the front, which matched the knickers Jenny had been wearing before her latest accident.
    She helped Jenny out of the bath, toweled her off, and offered her the new knickers.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now,&quot; she cautioned Jenny, &quot;these are very special flowers on these pants.
    They never need watering. So don't water the flowers, will you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No mummy,&quot; said Jenny, pulling on the new knickers and feeling the same warm,
    reassuring glow she'd felt when putting on the last pair of knickers that Sam had given
    her.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now, I've brought your nightdress,&quot; said Sam, &quot;but you don't have to go to
    bed just yet. We can go downstairs and watch television for a bit. Would you like
    that?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes mummy,&quot; said Jenny.<br>
    <br>
    So Sam slipped the nightdress on over Jenny's head, and led her down to the lounge. To
    Jenny's surprise, there was a shelf full of videos of children's television programmes,
    and they settled down to watch Bagpuss together. Sam sat at one end of a large leather
    settee, and Jenny snuggled up beside her.<br>
    <br>
    After about half an hour, Jenny began to feel a familiar twinge in her bladder. It brought
    the memory of her two accidents flooding back into her mind, and she blushed and had to
    fight to stifle a little sob. How COULD she have wet her knickers twice in a day? Then she
    thought of ice cream, and of her promise to Sam.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Mummy,&quot; she said.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes darling?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Jenny need wee-wee.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, hurry up and go then.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She jumped up and scampered off to the toilet. Unhampered by the romper suit, she had no
    difficulty managing by herself, and when she was done she pulled the chain and ran along
    back to join Sam in front of the video. They watched another episode of Bagpuss, and then
    Sam said: &quot;It's time for bed now, Jenny. Have you earned that bowl of ice cream I
    promised?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes mummy,&quot; said Jenny, a little too enthusiastically.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You're still dry are you?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Yes mummy,&quot; she beamed.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Show me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny proudly lifted her nightdress up to show Sam her knickers, and Sam slipped a hand
    between Jenny's legs and felt the gusset to ensure that it really was dry. Jenny enjoyed
    the sensation as Sam gently felt between her legs, and silently willed her to continue.
    But as soon as Sam was satisfied that Jenny's knickers were dry, she stopped feeling and
    led Jenny into the kitchen where she gave her another big bowl of ice cream, which Jenny
    wolfed down with enthusiasm.<br>
    <br>
    When Jenny had finished the ice cream, Sam led her up to the main bedroom and turned back
    the cover of the double bed. The room was scented with lavender. Jenny inhaled deeply,
    held her breath for a moment or two, and then breathed out. &quot;Mmmmm ... that smells
    lovely,&quot; she murmured.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Now Jenny,&quot; said Sam. &quot;Would you like me to put you in a nappy, just for
    tonight?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny was a little shocked by the suggestion. Then she remembered the games Sam played
    with Marcus, and realised that this question had probably been inevitable right from the
    moment she had wet her jade green cotton knickers down at the swimming pool. &quot;No
    mummy. I'll be alwight without.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Sam. &quot;You have had two accidents today already. We
    don't want you wetting the bed as well, do we now?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I won't wet the bed, mummy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Alright then. I'll trust you tonight. Now you run along and go to the toilet just to
    be sure, and I'll go and make you your bedtime cocoa.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Jenny went to the toilet, but her bladder was pretty empty and she didn't have to pee very
    much. Then she returned to the bedroom and climbed into the big, inviting double bed. Sam
    appeared in the doorway a moment or two later, carrying the most enormous cup of cocoa she
    had ever seen. Ah yes, she realised: the issue of scale. She was still playing Baby Jenny,
    so the cup of cocoa had to be oversize, just as the Ribena had been.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Would you like me to read you a bedtime story?&quot; asked Sam.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;No thank you, mummy&quot; said Jenny, who was beginning to feel a little bit drowsy
    already, such was the soporific effect of the lavender with which the room was scented.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Well, drink this down then, and sweet dreams,&quot; said Sam, handing her the mug.<br>
    <br>
    Jenny drained the mug, and then settled down into the warm, inviting bed. Sam took the
    empty mug from her and kissed her lightly on the forehead. &quot;Night, night, Jenny
    dear.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Night, night mummy.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Sam switched off the light and tiptoed out of the room.<br>
    <br>
