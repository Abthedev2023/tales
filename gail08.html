    </font><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FF0000"><br>
    Note: This story contains Female Desperation and Female Wetting.</font><p></strong><font
    face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kate shifted her weight, balancing
    evenly on both feet, and moved her legs about 18 inches apart. It was going to happen any
    second now, so she tensed her muscles and really started to concentrate. The tension was
    slowly killing her, she could feel her muscles starting to quiver and she knew that once
    it was all over she could finally take a deep breathe and relax. It was coming, and there
    was nothing she could do to stop it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She saw movement, her brain tracked
    it, and she flung herself to the right, stretching her leg as far as it would go. The
    hockey ball struck the outside of her pad, clipping a metal buckle, and deflected past the
    outside of the goalpost. &quot;Save&quot;, she thought, as the umpire blew the whistle for
    halftime and her teammates crowded around to congratulate her. They still had a 1-0 lead
    in the regional championship.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a hot and humid day, and Kate
    had been pounding down the Gatorade for over an hour. Even though all the goalkeeper
    equipment made her very hot and sweaty she was starting to feel a few aches &quot;down
    there&quot; and definitely felt the need to go. She knew from past experience that she
    would have just about enough time during the interval to take her pads off and run to the
    bathroom, as the umpires would usually cut her some slack about restarting the game if she
    wasn't ready. By the time her teammates backed away and they reached the sidelines a few
    precious minutes had already passed. Before Kate could even start to take a pad off the
    assistant coach took her to one side and started to talk about strategy. She was obviously
    going to have to grin and bear it.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At 5-11&quot; and 155lbs Kate was a
    pretty imposing and dominant figure in goal - and not one of those Thunder Thighs field
    hockey players the other girls made fun of at college. There was no doubt she had curves
    in all the right places, and in another lifetime could have made a decent living as a
    model. She had a reputation as being very conservative, to the extent that she wouldn't
    even change shirts on the field as that would show people her amply filled sports bra!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Barely five minutes into the second
    half Kate knew she was in trouble. The little aches in her groin and lower pelvic area had
    turned into pains, and the constant shuffling around from side to side wasn't helping
    either. The defense was under constant pressure, so it wasn't like she could stand around
    and watch the play at the other end. The goalie pads stopped her from squeezing her thighs
    together, and she couldn't find anyway to put a hand between her legs and take some
    pressure off her peehole. She was really starting to get desperate. Finally the ball was
    cleared up field, and without thinking she reached behind her and swigged down more
    Gatorade as her mouth was dry.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She almost cried realizing what she
    had just done, and tried going down on one knee to relieve the pressure. Suddenly the ball
    came flying down towards her, with one of her opponents in close pursuit. Kate had to fly
    out of her area to clear the danger, with every stride putting her in danger of disgracing
    herself on the field. When a field player was desperate to pee she could just squat down,
    pretend to tie a shoelace and gracefully water the grass, with only a damp stain to show
    on the dark sports shorts under their skirts. A goalkeeper couldn't do that - she had on a
    pair of sweatpants, padding, straps and the damn pads. Her pants were light gray -
    everyone would see she'd wet herself. Kate frantically ran through her options as she was
    forced to squeeze her bladder muscles even tighter. Pretending to retie her hair she
    thrust her hockey stick between her legs and squeezed it as hard as she could, that
    brought a little relief, but only for a minute or so.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I've gotta pee&quot; she
    started to mutter under her breath. Cindy, one of her defenders and a longtime friend
    looked over and asked what was wrong. &quot;I've gotta pee so bad&quot; Kate gasped. Cindy
    told her she only had to hang on another ten minutes - Kate knew that just wasn't going to
    happen. &quot;Geez, K - if you've got to pee that bad, just kneel down and let it go, then
    splash some Gatorade in your lap to cover it up.&quot; Kate started to think that maybe,
    just maybe, she could relieve the pressure by letting a little bit out - but past history
    told her that it was going to be all or nothing. She had a few incidents in her past when
    she'd almost waited too long and had amazed her friends with the volume and velocity of
    her pee. She thought about that one time a few months ago when she had pissed so hard and
    noisily into the portapotty at camp that she'd received applause when she stepped out to
    face her teammates in line.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With time running out the other team
    was mounting a furious attack. One of their wings got free and smashed a low cross in
    front of goal. Another player hit the ball on the volley and it was heading straight for
    the corner of her goal. Time literally stopped, Kate's instincts took over and she lunched
    across, almost doing the splits and made a catlike save. The ball rolled out to the side
    and Cindy smashed it up field. In the instant of stretching out Kate realized that nature
    would take its course. Her peehole muscles stretched and gave up the fight. Sitting on the
    ground with her pads in front of her, Kate's bladder eagerly sought its long-awaited
    release. It didn't start with a little dribble, or a small trickle, or even a couple of
    half-second spurts. Kate peed in a torrent, a waterfall, a cascade of urine pouring
    through her shorts, soaking her sweatpants before flowing onto the grass behind her. She
    could hear it - the sound of her pee jetting out from within her, and hitting the ground;
    she could feel it - that warm sensation around her bottom, between her legs and down her
    thighs; and she could smell it - that acrid fragrance of concentrated piss. Just like the
    tide, there was no stopping this rush of water until it was spent. Kate's bladder capacity
    matched her size, and she gushed for nearly a minute.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Kate sat on the ground for so long
    that the bench called out to her to see if she was injured. Jerked back into reality she
    gave them the OK sign; checked where the play was, and then grabbed her Gatorade bottle.
    Casually taking the top off she &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped it into her lap and let
    the contents empty out. The cold red liquid oozed between her thighs, a sensual opposite
    to the hot pee, which had tracked there but a minute before. Kate got up, looked down at
    herself and the ground, watching the large yellow puddle merge into the smaller red one.
    She swore loudly - and yelled at the bench for more Gatorade and a towel.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The last few minutes of the game
    passed by as a dream, the final whistle blew, the bench emptied and the entire team
    descended upon Kate in her goal. Oblivious to the large puddle around her and her soaking
    wet pants, they hugged and kissed her and even lofted her up upon their shoulders as their
    choice for MVP. If only they knew, she thought, still dripping... <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Great Performance K&quot;,
    said the coach.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;There was no way I was going
    to let them score&quot;, Kate replied.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
