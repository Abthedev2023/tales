    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The visiting team had won and now
    they were boarding the bus for the two-hour trip home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Also the cheer leading team and other fans that had gotten permission to
    ride the school bus to the game were boarding for the return trip home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that their team had won sort of threw the
    schedule and pre-boarding activities out of kilter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    danced and pranced around the boarding area congratulating each of the team members as
    they boarded their special bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She ignored
    the fact that her dancing and prancing concealed a need to void her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the team was boarded it was
    announced that the fans and cheerleaders would have to board also as they were to return
    caravan style.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy boarded one of the two
    remaining buses with her best friend Sandy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
    they settled into their seats in the back of the bus Nancy noticed that she should have
    used the restroom before boarding but she had been busy congratulating the team and it was
    too late to worry about it now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked
    Sandy if she needed to go to the bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sandy replied, &quot;No, I went
    before we boarded.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy giggled,<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I wish I had done the same.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fifteen minutes into the two-hour
    ride home Nancy began to experience severe discomfort with her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was full and beginning to cry for relief.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she squirmed and fidgeted she
    asked Sandy once again if she had to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sandy replied in the negative and
    asked Nancy what was the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was now desperate and she told
    Sandy that she had to pee badly, so badly that she knew she wouldn't make it home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandy said she would ask the chaperone teacher to
    allow a stop for comfort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Sandy came
    back down the aisle after talking to the chaperone Nancy could see in her face that a
    comfort stop was out of question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandy said
    &quot;You're gonna have to hold it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    sobbed and squirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For the next forty-five minutes
    Nancy squirmed and fidgeted in her seat fighting off the release of her bladder, which was
    desperately needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing a white
    knit turtle necked sweater and a red divided skirt with inverted center pleats front and
    back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She pulled and smoothed the skirts
    around her legs numerous times and then crossed her legs back and forth numerous times.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy's entire body was extremely tensed and her
    face was contorted from trying to hold back the contents of her full bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sandy once again appealed to the
    chaperone to stop the bus somewhere for Nancy's relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Once again she was rebuffed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile
    Nancy crossed her legs as tightly as she could and gained some relief from this posture.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She decided that she might be able to relax, as
    her crossed legs would prevent any leakage of pee.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Relax
    she did and horror of horrors she realized she was flooding her panties and culottes.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She peed for several seconds before regaining
    control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She moaned,<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh my God, I've wet myself.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandy threw her arm around her and said &quot;Hang
    on, I'll help all I can.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Are you
    OK now?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy said she was relieved for the
    present but she still had to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    whispered that her crotch was wet and that her bottom was soaked.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't know if her accident would show or not
    but if it did she would be humiliated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    was sitting in a puddle of her own making and thinking that she was seventeen but had wet
    herself as if she was seven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her face burned
    and she was feeling like the loneliest person in the world.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to cry but dared not lest it would
    emphasize her dilemma.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She sat there and leaned against the
    window in utter anxiety for the rest of the trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    wondered and wondered how she could get out of this situation.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She thought that maybe she was dreaming, that she
    hadn't wet herself at all; it was just an illusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    when she felt the wetness of her culottes in her crotch and along her buttocks and thighs
    she knew for sure that she had wet herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    wasn't a dream it was real, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bus pulled into the schoolyard where the
    parents would pick up those needing a ride home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy's
    father would be there and he was the last person in the world that Nancy would want to
    know that she had wet herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When everyone on the bus stood up
    and started to file off Nancy finally stood and looked at the front of her culottes and
    noticed that the center pleat hid her accident in the front.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She became elated and asked Sandy how her backside
    looked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Like you peed all over
    yourself,&quot; said Sandy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You have a
    dark wet patch all over your backside... Its obvious you peed yourself.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy decided that she would not get
    off the bus until all other students and teacher/chaperones had departed.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She told Sandy that she would not let her father
    see her from the rear and that everything would be OK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Since she had not completely voided during her accident she now needed to
    pee again but she knew she would make it home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    trick was to keep her daddy from knowing what a horrible thing she had done.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy noticed to her discomfort that
    one of the teachers was still seated and that the bus driver had not left her seat.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally the teacher stood and Nancy knew why she
    was slow departing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The teacher had an
    accident also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was wearing a gray business suit
    and when she stood she revealed a dark wet patch all over the back of her skirt.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy felt for her but then remembered her own wet
    clothing and stayed on board until the teacher left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Nancy boldly went up to her father and excitedly told him about the great
    win her team had accomplished all the while keeping her backside away from him.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of the other students had drifted off and she
    was confident that no one saw what she had done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
    daddy proposed that they stop at a popular drive-in for a snack on the way home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy rebelled knowing she could not possibly keep
    hiding her wet pants in such a situation. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her father insisted and finally
    Nancy told him that she needed to go home to use the bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;There are bathrooms you can use at
    Staley's,&quot; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy, feeling her
    wetness, cried, &quot;I need to go home.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Why
    can't you go at Staley's?&quot; he queried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    feeling trapped and on the verge of tears simply muttered,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;I need to go home.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nonsense,
    said her father, &quot;I'm famished and I bet you are too.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Please just take me home,&quot; moaned
    Nancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandy had heard all she could stand
    and blurted out to Nancy's father, &quot;Nancy has wet her pants. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It happened on the bus.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't help it because the teacher wouldn't
    let the driver stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She didn't want you to
    know, but she can't go in at Staley's without everyone seeing what she did.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She couldn't help it and I'm sorry for
    blabbing but Nancy needs to go straight home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm sorry for telling on you
    Nancy but I couldn't let this go on any longer.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>They went home in silence. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font><span lang="EN-US"
