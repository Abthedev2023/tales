    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was well aware of the beer
    drinker's rule of thumb; during the first six beers you will most likely forgo taking a
    trip to the rest room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, when you finally
    do succumb to an aching bladder after the first six you will find that you have to answer
    the call immediately and that the call will occur often.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>More accidents occur after the first six beers in a beer drinking session
    than at any other time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy had numerous
    experiences with beer drinking sessions but she had never had an accident until...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was in a neighborhood tavern
    drinking with her new boyfriend and she noticed that she had just finished her sixth beer.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She excused herself and went to the restroom
    to relieve herself in a normal manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
    her return to her table there was a fresh glass of lager and her boyfriend was gone.
    Probably he had to go pee she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    began to sip the beer and relax.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">By the time her boyfriend returned
    Nancy was feeling discomfort with her bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    quaffed the last of her latest beer and excused herself again.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When she returned she noted that her
    boyfriend had ordered another round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    began to sip as her boyfriend embarked on a story that would explain a great deal about
    his life and what he had become.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nancy
    wanted to hear his story very much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So much
    so that she was willing to forgo another trip to the restroom so as not to interrupt him.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But, the requirement of one beer
    equals one trip to the restroom after six beers began to prevail upon Nancy and as her
    boyfriend slowly related his story she found herself in a state of extreme distress.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pressure in her bladder was quickly building
    to a point where it could not be ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still,
    Nancy continued to ignore it. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy's entire body was tensed as
    her boyfriend droned on with his story. She told herself that she absolutely was not going
    to give in to the rule of beer drinkers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    was bound and determined to hold her pee until her boyfriend finished his story.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was by this time sitting bolt upright in her
    chair and fidgeting her hips.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The pressure in her bladder had
    become so steady and so strong and so persistent that she could no longer ignore it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pressure had built up much faster than she had
    anticipated. She was forced to let go after an interval so short she could not believe it
    would happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy wet her pants at the
    table without squirming and fidgeting to control her bladder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The onrush of pressure from a full bladder
    happened so fast that it caught her completely by surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh My god, I've just wet
    myself,&quot; she announced.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She was in
    shock and extremely embarrassed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt a
    puddle in her chair and she knew that her brown trousers would show a wet patch in her
    crotch and seat that she could not possibly explain other than the fact that she, a grown
    woman, had peed herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She sat
    there shaking her head and moaning that she couldn't believe that she had done such a
    thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was absolutely humiliated.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She started to stand and said, &quot;I'd
    better go to the bathroom&quot;, although she wished that wasn't an option in her
    situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was so distressed with her wet
    pants she didn't know what to do and she desperately wanted someone to take her away from
    this extremely embarrassing situation without her showing that she had wet herself.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her new boyfriend seemed to be a bit on the
    sensitive side and he took control of the situation.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her boyfriend stood quickly and
    placed a hand on her shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Don't go
    here,&quot; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You'll have to
    walk by many booths where your friends are seated. You don't want them to know what you
    did do you?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let's get out of here by the
    shortest route available, I'll leave enough for the check and you just walk as upright as
    you can to the nearest exit and I'll follow as close behind as I can.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe, no one will notice.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm betting no one will
    notice.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy was so grateful for his
    plan that she acquiesced without doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But,
    she couldn't help the tears streaming down her cheeks as they exited the bar.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, she will always wonder how many patrons of
    the bar saw that she had wet herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her boyfriend said that his place
    was closer and that was where he would take her so she could clean herself.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since she hadn't completely voided in the bar she
    had another conflict in his car on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    beer was once again trying to assert itself to the fact that what goes in must come out.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, Nancy could now squirm and fidget and try all
    the moves that people desperate to pee have come up with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>And, squirm and fidget she did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    continued to try to keep her discomfort from her boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Eventually, she had to grab her crotch hoping her fingers would stop the
    flow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she cried out &quot;Let me out of
    the car, I'm going to pee again!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't help
    it, I'm going to wet myself again.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her boyfriend said that his place
    was only two blocks away but she moaned &quot;I don't care; I'm peeing myself.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When he pulled up to park on the
    street in front of his apartment, Nancy was weeping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She was wet from nearly her waist to her ankles.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her loafers and socks were drenched.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had her head down and her hand covered her
    face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh God, what have I done?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm so sorry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I'll clean your car seat and anything else I've messed up- I'm so ashamed
    and embarrassed I don't know what to do.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
    the tears flowed like torrents.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Meanwhile her boyfriend was boned to
    the max.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had only dreamed of such a
    situation and here it was in front of him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    couldn't wait for Nancy to get out of the car so he could survey the damage of her
    wetting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But, he was sensitive to her
    embarrassment so he shielded her as much as possible from a public view of her wet pants.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Between his excruciating sexual urge and her
    vulnerability they had a great time making love for the entire weekend.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But, Nancy decided then and there
    that she would never again tempt her bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
    the first sign of fullness she would immediately search for a bathroom.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The very fact that she didn't keep this promise is
    the fact that more stories about Nancy and her ability or lack thereof to control her
    bladder will continue.<o:p></o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
