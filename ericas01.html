    Desperation and Accidental Wetting.<br>
    </strong></font><br>
    <br>
    I had my first-ever real accident the other day. I'm not sure if that is reason for
    celebrating, but through all my hanging around on various sites and such, people always
    exclaimed that, &quot;Everyone has had an accident in their lives!&quot; And I always felt
    chastened, because I never had, and people seemed to think I was lying when I said so.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, as to the day and incident (accident) in question...<br>
    <br>
    I was at work, and it was a very long day. We don't get a lunch hour or tea breaks, not as
    you would understand them. We get two fifteen-minute breaks over the course of six hours.
    The first break period arrived and I felt a slight twinge, indicating that I needed to
    relieve myself. However, I was sidetracked by something that came up (another drawback to
    my job is that we often end up using these precious break periods to make or take phone
    calls, or deal with other minutiae) and never got around to going to the toilet. Usually,
    if one goes after the break period is over, that isn't looked on as something bad, but our
    boss is pretty strict and gets into strange moods where any little infraction will set her
    off. So I decided that I could wait until the next break period, two hours later.<br>
    <br>
    Two hours later, I had finished drinking my tea and was about to head to the bathroom when
    something stopped me. I just thought to myself, 'I wonder how long I can hold it?' And I
    just didn't go, but continued to chat to my colleagues in the break room.<br>
    <br>
    Once the official working day was over, I once again started off for the bathroom, but
    stopped myself. 'Come on, you're not that desperate yet,' I thought to myself. 'You can
    wait some more.' So I went off to help with an hour of computer literacy classes in
    another part of the complex. Leaving the computer center, I was beginning to feel pretty
    desperate. Not at the 'holding yourself, legs crossed' stage, but I was getting there. I
    knew right then that I should just give up and go to the bathroom, but I didn't. I
    returned to my work area and proceeded to finish up some work.<br>
    <br>
    I sat there initialing documents and completing forms, but eventually my need to pee began
    to rise. I *really* needed to go! And my work area was a long way from the bathroom! I
    looked at the time. I only had half an hour before I had to leave, so I thought that I'd
    just go to the bathroom on my way out of the complex. I continued to work, but now I was
    crossing my legs tightly.<br>
    <br>
    Five minutes passed. Ten. I started to think that I'd never make it to the bathroom.
    Remember, my goal was to hold it as long as possible, not pee in my pants. The pressure on
    my full bladder was getting pretty bad. I had my legs crossed with my foot right around
    the back of my calf, that's how desperate I was. I'd like to say that I was crying with
    desperation, but I've always rather liked being desperate. Not as desperate as this,
    however! I started wondering why the hell I'd thought this was a good idea. By now twenty
    minutes had passed, and I was biting my lip with the effort of not peeing.<br>
    <br>
    I started to pack up my things. And, as luck would have it, I sneezed. (I should mention
    that I work in a very dusty place. At the end of every workday, every single surface is
    covered with a thin layer of dust. Most of the people who work here have sinus problems.)
    I realized I was going to sneeze just as it happened, and though I crossed my legs
    tightly, I was too late to prevent some pee coming out. It wasn't that much, but before I
    could straighten up from the bent-over position I'd assumed to try and stem the pee, I
    sneezed again, and this time let out quite a lot! Because of my position, the pee did not
    make it to the back of my pants or down the legs, but was concentrated in the front crotch
    area. And I was wearing cream-colored pants!<br>
    <br>
    But now I had a little relief from the pee that was now soaking the front of my panties
    and pants, and was able to finish packing up. What to do? I had no sweater I could drape
    over my arm. I had no large bag. All I could do was pull my long shirt down over my crotch
    area and hope that no one would see what I'd done.<br>
    <br>
    I passed no one in the halls and made it to the bathroom, where I surveyed the damage-
    back of the pants - fine, except for a small dark spot in a delicate place. Front -
    *large* wet spot, but with none going down the legs. Thank goodness. I got myself out to
    the car by holding down my shirt, and when I passed someone, mumbling about food stains on
    it (to make it seem as though I was examining my shirt, not hiding the fact that I'd peed
    in my pants). I sat on top of a magazine on the way home, to protect the seat - a tactic
    that did work.<br>
    <br>
    Once at home I rushed for the bathroom, but started peeing again before I even had my
    panties off, so I climbed into the bath and just let it go, soaking my panties right
    through. The relief I felt was immense!<br>
    <br>
    Would I do it again? Well, as I said, I like being desperate, so I probably will. But
    peeing myself wasn't fun. Luckily the center was almost deserted when I left, or I would
    have been extremely embarrassed and humiliated. Next time I won't wait so long to go to
    the toilet. A sneeze might just derail my plans!<br>
