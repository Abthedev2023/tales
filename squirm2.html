      <P align="left"> <BR>
        My name is Lynne and this is the story of the longest afternoon of my 
        life. I was new to the typing pool, it was my first job, and I loved it. 
        There were 12 of us, all girls in our 20s, and although we worked hard 
        we had a lot of laughs. I dressed to fit in with the others - a smart 
        brown suit with a short skirt that was barely decent. I felt good, and 
        I looked good! Friday lunchtimes we went to the pub, taking a full hour. 
        Colin - our immediate boss - would buy us all a drink, and we would all 
        be a bit high as the weekend approached. The events I am going to tell 
        you about happened on one of those fridays which started off exactly as 
        usual.<BR>
        <BR>
        We had our morning coffee at 11, we were working hard. Lunch was a welcome 
        break, and we trooped off to the pub. Colin brought us the lagers, and 
        we chipped in for a second round. Two pints each left us tipsy and happy, 
        this was the home stretch. I was by now acutely aware of my full bladder, 
        and hooking my ankles under my chair I rhythmically squeezed my thighs 
        together. We all had an unwritten rule - you pee during work time, not 
        your own time - so it was just a matter of hanging on until we got back 
        to the office. Then unexpectedly Colin went to the bar and bought us each 
        a 3rd pint - &quot;My treat&quot; was all he said - and we thanked him 
        and drank up. By the time we left the pub I couldn't keep still for a 
        moment. It was years since I had been as desperate as this and I was hoping 
        I would make it back to the office in time.<BR>
        <BR>
        Well I did, and went straight to the loo. Unexpectedly the door was open, 
        and when I went in there was a plumber with the cistern off and lying 
        in bits on the floor. &quot;Oh no&quot; I cried, crossing my legs hard, 
        &quot;What are you<BR>
        doing?&quot; &quot;Sorry love&quot; he said, &quot;I'll be as quick as 
        I can.&quot; Fully half the office was queued up behind me and there was 
        a groan as I told them the news. Not one of us had emptied our bladders 
        all day, and our half pint of coffee and 3 lagers had really hit the spot. 
        We filed into the office and sat at our desks.<BR>
        <BR>
        Fifteen minutes later not one girl was sitting still. We typed, and squirmed, 
        crossing and uncrossing our legs. Only Colin appeared comfortable, and 
        - thinking back - had a slight smirk on his face. I was now in big trouble. 
        My body was quivering with the effort of squeezing my weary sphincter, 
        and nothing I did seemed to give any relief. I slid forward and back on 
        my chair banging my thighs together, and periodically wriggled my bum 
        hard onto the edge of the chair. I pushed hard at the top of my thighs, 
        and stuck my bum out backwards sucking through my teeth. Time seemed to 
        slow to a crawl. I became aware of Colin coming back into the room - &quot;Not 
        long now girls&quot; he announced, and got glared at. I slipped my hand 
        between my thighs and pressed hard with my fingertips. That was good - 
        but I couldn't go to the loo like that. It was half-past-three, what was 
        that plumber<BR>
        doing? Nobody spoke now, and the room was filled with the erratic rhythmic 
        sound of tights rubbing together or against seats. We passed on afternoon 
        coffee - except for Colin, and dutifully typed on. Out of the corner of 
        my<BR>
        eye I could see constant movement, we were all absolutely dying for the 
        loo, every desk had an uncomfortable wriggling girl sitting at it, every 
        seat was in danger of being suddenly soaked. I now became aware of my 
        next problem. My desk was furthest from the door, there was one loo. There 
        would be a queue and I would be close to last. My mind spun as I wriggled 
        in my seat, but I could think of no easy way out - could I survive listening 
        to a series of long hard peeings? I doubted it, but what choice did I 
        have.<BR>
        <BR>
        It was fully 4.15 when the plumber stuck his head in, &quot;OK girls, 
        that's me done.&quot; And was gone. There was a rush to the door, and 
        we jostled into a rough queue. I was second last, one girl in the loo, 
        and nine more to go<BR>
        before I got my relief. None of us pretended now, we danced and held ourselves, 
        there were groans and that sucking noise through the teeth that doesn't 
        help but has to be done. And we could all hear each long hard<BR>
        stream, often ending in several short trickles. Each sound caused my bladder 
        to tighten violently, only by clenching my fists, curling my toes hard, 
        and squeezing with all my strength could I keep myself dry. I was sweating, 
        and worse I was tiring. Each spasm seemed stronger, the effort required 
        harder. And the cooridor was packed with girls doing exactly the same! 
        The queue was moving soooo slowly I couldn't believe it.<BR>
        <BR>
        Just as I thought I might make it, the girl in front of me wet herself. 
        I heard her &quot;Ohhh&quot;, and she clawed at her groin. Then there 
        was a hissing that muffled slightly as she crossed her legs. Her eyes 
        were shut, and I watched her tights shine as her pee poured out. As I 
        watched I felt the first squirt into my own panties and I clenched my 
        pee-hole muscles hard. Then there was another squirt, and another. I could 
        do nothing to stop them. I hooked both hands hard against my fanny - one 
        from in front, one from behind and pulled upwards. And still I was spurting 
        warm urine. I became aware of the sound of yet another hard stream from 
        the loo, and my bladder gave up. Pee cascaded through my fingers, running 
        hot down my legs. I kicked off my shoes, and<BR>
        watched my puddle mingle with the one already there. When I finally got 
        into the loo, I put my tights and panties in the bin, and dried myself 
        off. I felt strangely turned-on, and I rubbed myself to a shuddering gasping<BR>
        climax. This was an unexpected pleasure, and I returned and sat knickerless 
        in the office for the final half-hour of the day. I was sure Colin (bulge 
        in trousers) had engineered this, but how could we prove it?<BR>
        <BR>
        Well each day now is even more fun. I drink like a fish and hold off until 
        I am absolutely bursting and squirming uncontrollably at my desk. Just 
        when I am about to lose control I slip out to the loo and straddle the 
        pan - this<BR>
        puts all the pressure on my sphincter and I have to squeeze with all my 
        might. I often wait for several minutes like this then I slip one finger 
        against my clit and slowly, slowly run it up and down. By this stage I 
        am slippery with anticipation. I try not to breath too noisily - and bite 
        my lip as my climax approaches. It's always a double pleasure the orgasm 
        and the rush of my pent-up pee into the loo. Colin pays a lot of attention 
        too me, now ..... We'll see.</P>
