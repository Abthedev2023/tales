    <br>
    I now present a story of male desperation. While I am strictly heterosexual, I have often
    been interested in male desperation- mostly concerning men who are middle aged to older,
    grey haired and distinguished. This is based on a true story that was told to me by a
    relative who knew this man. She described him as resembling the actor George Kennedy.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Damn I gotta go,&quot; George thought to himself as he gritted his teeth and
    squirmed in his seat. He had been sitting in a massive traffic jam on the Palisades
    Parkway as he was driving in to work. The drive into New York usually took 1/2 hour but he
    had now been sitting in traffic for well over an hour and the coffee and juice with
    breakfast was now catching up to him. He really had to go. He was not just uncomfortable,
    but having to make a real effort to hold it in. Worst of all, there was no place for him
    to go. The cause of the backup was a torrential rain and sleet storm. Even though the
    Palisades Parkway is close to New York, it is in a very rural setting and the exits are
    far apart.<br>
    <br>
    Now George was in trouble, his need was increasing to tremendous levels. It was now an
    emergency and he had to go so bad he was going out of his skin. He was not sure how long
    he could hold it in. He squeezed his muscle shut so forcefully it made his penis rise up
    and press against his sorts and slacks, and for the first time as an adult he felt he
    could actually wet his pants.<br>
    <br>
    He never felt this way. Before, no matter how badly he had to go he was always sure he
    could hold it in until he got somewhere. But now, as his 60 something year old bladder and
    prostate were no longer what they used to be, he found he could not hold it for nearly as
    long, especially when it became an emergency.<br>
    <br>
    And this was an emergency. He frantically squirmed as he tried to get his quivering penis
    to fit between his now crossed legs. He could not get a lot of pressure on it as it was
    sticking up due to his clenched muscle. He leaned forward to try to get it to face down
    but that put such abdominal pressure on his bladder that his need increased to almost an
    unbearable level. He felt like his urine had filled his penis and was pressing it's edge
    with all its might to get out. He winced his eyes shut and groaned and sat back up
    straight. That relieved the pain somewhat put he still had to go so bad he felt he would
    go any minute. The pressure was unbearable. He continued squirming like crazy. At one
    point he turned sideways and was facing the door window to get rid of the discomfort. He
    then sat straight and clenched his thighs together to aid his pee muscle as his penis shot
    up between his legs. He would then re-cross his legs differently to get the most pressure,
    but with each passing moment he felt he was losing control.<br>
    <br>
    He looked ahead and saw no sign of the traffic easing. The rain coming down on his car
    only reminded him of the fluid he was with holding. He really started to panic as the
    thought was wetting his pants, in his car became a reality. When his need increased again
    he felt a level of pressure and pain he did not think was possible. At that moment, he let
    go of the wheel and with both hands gripped his penis. He had never done this as an adult,
    but it was the only thing that prevented something else he had not done as an adult. He
    was gritting his teeth and frantic. He saw a sign saying a rest stop was a mile away and
    he did not think he could hold it in that long. Even if he got there in time, he felt he
    would have to wait in line for the men's room or beg for a key and he did not think he
    would last. He had to go so badly and felt there was just no place to go, except in his
    pants. Getting out of the car was not possible because of the storm and of the way he
    carried himself. He was a well-dressed, successful man who did not want to draw that kind
    of attention, but it was also unthinkable that he would wet his pants. He was in such
    despair.<br>
    <br>
    Over the next 1/2 hour, his need kept increasing, as did his grip on his penis, as did his
    uncertainty of finding anyplace to go to the bathroom before it was too late. He also was
    feeling a throbbing pain in his lower belly in addition to the unbearable pressure he was
    trying to hold back. Several times he would twist his legs in a knot and contort his whole
    body while groaning in pain. When traffic would move he would have to uncross his legs and
    put one hand on the wheel to drive. Each time he felt he would loose control, somehow just
    managing to hold on.<br>
    <br>
    He then got an idea. On the floor in the back of his car were two rubber boots he had just
    bought for an upcoming fishing trip. For a moment, he brushed off that idea as disgusting.
    He was then forced to grip his penis even tighter once again and pound his legs up and
    down. He felt he would wet himself right there. He had to do something. He just could not
    hold it any more. He did not even think he could make it out of the car and get behind a
    tree.<br>
    <br>
    In the most painful move he could put his body through, he leaned backwards in the car
    toward the backseat and grabbed the bag with the boots, groaning all the while. To get the
    boots out he had to take his hands of his penis. He truly felt his urine would shoot
    directly up and go through the windshield. He crossed his legs and pressed his thigh on
    his penis. He finally got one boot out and he dropped it to place both hands back on his
    penis or he would go right there. With one hand he placed the boot on the floor in front
    of him and frantically undid his belt, opened his pants and zipper and with the other hand
    took his penis out of his boxers.<br>
    <br>
    He placed the boot in front of his penis, which was bulging and pale from being held. He
    then placed it into the boot and he let his urine go. It shot out with such force it
    almost knocked the boot from his hand. He then closed his eyes and his sigh was almost as
    loud as his urine hitting the bottom of the boot. Finally, sweet, blessed relief had
    replaced the agony and the fear of wetting his pants. He opened his eyes to see the
    knee-high boot already half full with the hot foaming fluid. He kept on going and going
    and going. He was amazed at not only the force of his stream, but also the scope of it. It
    looked at least 2 inches thick and wondered how it could fit out of him. At his age, it
    had been a long time since his stream was like this. He soon knew he would have to stop.
    He then dumped the contents out the window and proceeded to fill the boot 3 more times
    until he was done.<br>
    <br>
    Now that his ordeal was over and he was in total bliss with relief, he could laugh as the
    name piss n boots entered his mind, and he would use it to tell people what had happened. <font
