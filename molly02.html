    color="#000000">Hi it's me, Molly. I am gonna tell you about another of my accidents. I
    was at my little sister's girl scouts' cookout. My mom wasn't able to go so I went with my
    little sister. We drove there and there were about 75 little girls and their mothers also.
    We got out and I found my friend Ashlie. I was talking to Ashlie for a while when we
    decided to go out to the clubs tonight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">It was perfect because my little sister
    already asked to stay at one of her friends' house.&nbsp; I said it would be all right
    with me.&nbsp; Anyway we left and stopped at her house and then stopped at my house to
    change quickly and then we were off.&nbsp; Being the stupid person that I am I didn't go
    to the bathroom before I left.&nbsp; As we were driving I felt the urge to go.&nbsp; It
    wasn't that bad and I could hold it.&nbsp; I could tell that Ashlie had to go too because
    the whole way there she said very little and had her hands in her crotch the whole time.
    &nbsp; We finally got there and got in with no problem.&nbsp; After getting in we were
    shocked at the&nbsp; line for the ladies room.&nbsp; We stood in line patiently waiting
    for the bathrooms.&nbsp; All of a sudden two guys asked us over for a drink.&nbsp; I said
    sure and so did Ashlie.&nbsp; The guys got the first round of beers and I drank mine down
    like it was nothing.&nbsp; Ashlie took her time with hers.&nbsp; The next round I got and
    we drank them down like they were nothing at all.&nbsp; After I was done I felt the
    greatest urge to pee that I have ever felt before.&nbsp; I told Ashlie that I had to go
    NOW!&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashlie came with me but she wasn't fidgeting.&nbsp; I glanced at the
    crotch of her skintight jeans and they were soaking wet.&nbsp; I couldn't help it any
    longer. I unbuttoned my top button of my skintight jeans and thrust my hands down to my
    crotch.&nbsp; I reached the door and just opened it when it was just too much.&nbsp; My
    mouth dropped and my hands covered my mouth.&nbsp; My jeans were soaked.&nbsp; We went
    over to the guys and got the most humiliation ever.&nbsp; They stood up and laughed at us.
    &nbsp; Soon others started laughing at us.&nbsp; I was so embarrassed that I started to
    cry.&nbsp; Ashlie did the same.&nbsp; I told Ashlie in a sob that we should kick these
    guys in the nuts.&nbsp; Ashlie agreed. I swung my leg back and with the guy facing me I
    kicked him right square in the nuts.&nbsp; Ashlie did the same.&nbsp; The guys dropped to
    the floor and were crying.&nbsp; We then left and went home.&nbsp; Let that be a lesson to
    guys out there, never piss a girl off or you will pay.</font><font FACE="Courier New"
