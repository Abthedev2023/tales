    <br>
    <br>
    I have always been into desperation peeing and playing games.<br>
    <br>
    I could not get my wife interested in it at all. One night we went to a new bar to listen
    to a friend's band play. Little did I know that the ladies' bathroom was under
    construction, as it was being completely remodeled. As the night went on and we were both
    drinking, my wife went to the ladies' room to go to the bathroom. She didn't say anything
    when she returned, but as the night went on I saw in her all the signs of desperation. I
    asked her what was wrong and she said that she had to pee!<br>
    <br>
    She said that there were no stalls, just toilets with no dividing walls, and she couldn't
    go like that. I told her I would take her outside and let her go, but she said that she
    had never done that before and she didn't know how, and that she would rather wait. We sat
    there for about five minutes and I saw that she was more desperate then ever. I again
    asked her if she wanted to go outside and she said NO!<br>
    <br>
    About ten minutes later she just bolted up and headed for the door! I got up and followed
    her. We got out by the car and she said that she had to go now and asked me to help her.
    There were people coming and going, so I had her walk a little ways toward a bunch of
    trees- I was also trying to make her wait a little longer.<br>
    <br>
    Someone was getting out of a car close to the trees so she had to stand there and wait
    even a little longer. She did the best pee dance that I have ever seen and so of course I
    was hard as a rock by this time! The people finally left and I took her by the hand and
    lead her into the trees.<br>
    <br>
    She had no clue as to what to do, as she never peed outside before. I looked around for a
    big tree to get her behind and left her standing and dancing. When I looked back, she had
    her pants and underwear around her knees with her hands shoved up to her pussy. She yelled
    to me to help her and I got behind her to hold her up and she squatted down to pee.<br>
    <br>
    I put my hand under her so I could play with her while she peed. She saw that and told me
    to move it and not to touch her. I did move it and she started to pee and I put my hand
    over her pussy and felt the hot piss pour through my hand. She yelled at me again and I
    just kept my hand there anyhow. She finished and we went back inside. I noticed that she
    had all but stopped drinking for the night. When it was time to go we had to drive about
    35 miles through the countryside to get to where we were staying for the night. About
    halfway there I stopped to take a leak and asked her if she had to go. She said she did,
    but that she could wait. I lied and told her we wouldn't get to where we were going for
    another 30 minutes, which she believed, as she didn't know the area.<br>
    <br>
    She then got out to pee with me and again I helped her to squat down and put my hand under
    her to feel her pee. She yelled at me again but I didn't move my hand this time either,
    and she peed! We made it to where we were spending the night and she rushed in to use the
    bathroom and I asked her to wait. She asked why. I pulled my hard on out and said let's
    make love first.<br>
    <br>
    She reluctantly agreed and we jumped into bed. I started to eat her out and she told me to
    stop it, as she really needed to pee now. I didn't stop and she yelled again as she was
    coming. She also peed a little bit and it tasted wonderful. She hadn't realized that she
    peed and then I got up to mount her. She said she had to pee first and I just kept on
    going anyhow and got my dick into her and started to pump away. We both came violently,
    and then she started to pee, and she knew it this time. She tried to stop it but couldn't.
    She got up and ran to the bathroom holding her hand over her pussy with pee gushing out.<br>
    <br>
    All in all, it was a great night for me!<br>
