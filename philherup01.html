    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie checked her watch.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just past 5:30 and just outside her comfort zone.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Six months into her job and life in New York, and
    she had the timing down perfectly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two liters
    of water and no restroom breaks after 4:00, and let the rumbling on the subway do the
    rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was late October, and that
    morning had been pleasantly chilly on the walk from her apartment to the station and then
    to her office at the end of the line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    overcast sky and the ever so slight nip in the breeze had gotten her thinking; maybe this
    was one of her special days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When lunchtime
    had finally rolled around, she'd known for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Friday
    night, a place of her own downtown, all that time to herself and the melancholy from the
    last breakup nicely faded now...yep, she thought, tonight is for me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With all that water working its way
    through her, the ride downtown was doing its share, Maggie thought naughtily, uncrossing
    and re-crossing her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Usually she didn't
    even try to get a seat on the subway, but Her Days were special.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was never quite sure whether the jiggling of
    the seats eased her pleasant discomfort or intensified it, but the ability to sit with her
    legs crossed tightly was definitely a plus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie
    wasn't into public wetting, especially not in her expensive work clothes, so keeping her
    bladder full but under control was the name of the game on the ride home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And the inevitable fidgeting was
    part of the fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remembering how she always
    got off on seeing guys desperate for a pee on bar-runs in college, Maggie always felt a
    rush in spite of herself whenever some guy gave any indication that he'd stumbled onto her
    secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sweet vulnerability, she thought
    today as she made brief eye contact with a kid across the aisle - he didn't look older
    than nineteen - who had clearly been watching as she shifted in her seat and re-crossed
    her legs for what was probably the third time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Resisting the temptation to look
    away shyly, she smiled at the boy as she smoothed out her black pleated skirt and gathered
    up the strap of her briefcase in anticipation of the next stop.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He nodded and smiled as well.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't help wondering if he'd be jacking off
    to this image for years to come - the well-dressed young woman on the subway who was
    clearly dying to pee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Well, maybe not dying just yet, she
    conceded as she exited the car and headed for the gates and the old cement stairs.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But the sweet torture was coming soon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Out on the street, it was dark
    except for the headlights of the passing cars, the time change having come two weeks
    before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was three blocks to Maggie's
    apartment building from the subway stop, and the walk did a world of good.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd been doing her best to avoid giving in to
    the cold weather and breaking out her winter coat just yet, and this was feeling like it
    might be the last evening in which to get away with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Her wool blazer and dark turtleneck were perfect against the breeze, which
    blew her long skirt gently against her nylon-clad legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>The slight draft under her skirt and the movement of her legs provided the
    perfect foil for the delicious, not overwhelming but strong tickle now calling out from
    between her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So this is Maggie, she thought
    happily as she admired the old brownstones along her way as usual.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is what it was all meant to lead up to, all
    along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mostly happy, but bumpy childhood
    in a rough and tumble New England mill town, fourth of her parents' five kids and the only
    girl, the tomboy who switched to peasant-dresses sometime in college and now business
    suits; the flailing around for a year and change after college and living at home,
    settling on law school as a last resort and somehow striking gold there to wind up in
    Manhattan, all the brief relationships that went nowhere, but at least I'm finally happy
    with my job, this is Maggie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And so, though
    nobody knows it but me, is this masochistic game I sometimes play on Fridays when I need
    my quality time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Walking eagerly up the steps to her
    building, she found herself reflecting, as she so frequently did, on the origin of her
    favorite private pastime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She'd been sixteen when it had
    happened - over a decade ago now, she mused - and she had Erin to thank for it all, though
    she didn't think she ever had discussed it with Erin. She'd so often meant to do so, she
    recalled, but somehow she just didn't think Erin would understand, bless her heart.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If she even remembers that day at all, Maggie
    thought now. Somehow Maggie doubted it meant much to her, but to Maggie...She allowed that
    thought to go unfinished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stopping at the top
    of the stairs, as she fished around in her purse for her keys and absentmindedly wrapped
    one leg around the other, smiling to herself, her mind's eye summoned her eldest brother
    Jonathan's room back home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jonathan had married Erin two years
    before that fateful morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were so
    much older than Maggie - nine years, to be exact - that she could barely recall a time
    when Jonathan had lived at home with the rest of the family or when Erin wasn't around.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He'd met her in college, and if Mom and Dad hadn't
    been thrilled with her at first, they'd learned to love her just as Jonathan had.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie got along with her okay as well, but
    there'd always been a sense of distance she couldn't quite explain.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not sisters, not quite friends, and Erin always
    seemed such a braniac back then, a smarty-pants from much cushier origins with beautiful
    clothes at a time when Maggie was still eschewing such things, and even with the beautiful
    clothes there was something unattractive about her to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it was her broad, manlike shoulders, or her
    curly but limp hair that reminded Maggie vaguely of so many teachers she couldn't stand;
    she couldn't put her finger on it in all those years, but there was something about Erin.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd always seemed far above Maggie somehow.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Always, until that late spring day when Jonathan
    and Erin had brought their baby up for the first visit with the grandparents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Little Andy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's thirteen now, Maggie figured as she unlocked
    the front door, realizing she hadn't actually seen him in several years.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was only a few weeks old on that great morning
    that opened a secret door for Maggie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sixteen-year-old
    Maggie, despite her tough, tomboyish style in those days, was just as smitten with little
    Andy as the rest of the family was on that first visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>That morning, while Jonathan was out with their parents and Erin was in the
    shower, Maggie jumped at the chance to have a look at the baby on her own.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was fast asleep in his bassinet while his
    mother had a few minutes on her own across the hall, and Maggie strode quietly into the
    room and sat on the window-seat beside the bassinet, curling her legs up under her and
    adoring the boy, wanting to stroke his cheek with her finger but scared of waking him up.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was still gazing admiringly at
    him a few minutes later when Erin returned to the room, in her bathrobe.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie jolted slightly, feeling a bit like an
    intruder, but Erin seemed happy to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Maggie!&quot;
    she said quietly but happily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Getting
    to know your nephew, are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That's right,&quot; Maggie
    said a bit shyly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Hope I'm not
    intruding.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Don't be silly!&quot; Erin
    smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm glad you like having him
    here.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thanks.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He's a cutie, all right.&quot; Maggie turned back
    to admiring the baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Love those little
    fingers, everything looks so perfect.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    must have been hard waiting to see this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, it was, for us both!&quot;
    Erin said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;But it's worth everything
    having him here now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm sure - &quot; Maggie
    began, turning back to look at Erin - and seeing for the first time that Erin had removed
    her bathrobe and was standing before her stark naked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin, I'm
    sorry-&quot; she exclaimed, getting up to leave and turning her gaze away from her
    sister-in-law's bare body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Maggie, it's okay!&quot; Erin
    laughed, showing no inclination to cover her nakedness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She reached out and held Maggie by the shoulders.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mags, we're sisters!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's nothing to be embarrassed about.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled at the younger girl, who looked her in
    the eye and smiled, then openly looked down at Erin's engorged breasts and still-distended
    tummy. Then she put her arm around Maggie and walked back over to the bassinet with her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Relax.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jon and I want to bring Andy up to be comfortable
    with his body, and we're doing our best to set a good example for him.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked down at herself and then back at
    Maggie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;There's nothing to be
    embarrassed about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And this is what pregnancy
    can do to you, if you were wondering,&quot; she said good-naturedly, with a sardonic
    smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie smiled as well.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;What it can do to you?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You look fine, Erin, really.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she did look fine.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Very motherly, Maggie thought.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But what had grabbed her attention, now that she
    had a fuller view, was Erin's dense and expansive bush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Dark and thick and reaching at least seven inches across the base of her
    belly and out onto her thighs, it was surely twice the size of Maggie's own.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie was torn between pity and envy and even
    attraction, though she'd never had a thing for women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin laughed when she realized what
    Maggie was gawking at.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Pregnancy can
    do that too,&quot; she said, flicking the hairs lightly with her right hand.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Don't worry, I wasn't always this hairy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It has to do with hormones going crazy on
    you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I was wondering,&quot; Maggie
    admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I was just thinking that if
    that were me, I couldn't wear a two-piece!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie
    - who had just ventured to the pool in a bikini for the first time a few weeks before -
    would regret that comment for years; even now, she cringed as she remembered saying it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How could I be that impertinent? She wondered,
    shaking her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But if Erin was offended, she kept
    it to herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She laughed slightly, then
    said, &quot;Don't worry, Mags, there's life after puberty at the beach.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never wear bikinis anyway, not because of
    this&quot; - she flicked her big triangle playfully again - &quot;but 'cause I've never
    been as confident as you are!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm sorry!&quot; Maggie said
    immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I shouldn't have said
    that, I was just...impressed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Impressed?&quot; Erin
    chuckled, pulling on her nursing bra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Well,
    thanks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if I was ever impressed
    with my body, but I'm happy with it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, good,&quot; Maggie said,
    still feeling bad for her remark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
    didn't mean anything...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I know, Mags.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's fine, really.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I can wear a swimsuit without much trouble!&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By now they were both giggling loudly enough for
    Maggie to worry about waking the baby, but he only stirred a bit.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And she was now curious as to just how Erin did
    look in a swimsuit, pregnant or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
    she really did feel like they were sisters, as Erin had said, for the first time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then, as Maggie would often recall
    later, including this night, Erin very casually ratcheted up the intimacy of the moment
    even higher.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With no sign of embarrassment
    at all that Maggie could see, Erin pulled out a half-full package of adult diapers from
    her suitcase and neatly put on a pair, all the while still chatting about the baby.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Remembering her manners this time
    after the swimsuit comment, Maggie fought down the urge to ask.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, she vaguely recalled her mother warning
    her and her one remaining still-at-home brother before the visit, &quot;let Erin have dibs
    on the bathroom at all times, no complaints!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
    her curiosity was running higher than ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was
    this new?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Must be, Erin had been a guest here
    before with no warnings from Mom...but what was up?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It must have shown.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erin saw Maggie looking at her now-covered bush
    again and laughed a bit, now looking embarrassed for the first time.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh, sorry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I've just gotten so used to wearing these and only Jon seeing them since we
    got home from the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another memento of pregnancy.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She smiled awkwardly but genuinely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, I'm sorry,&quot; Maggie
    replied, trying hard to look sympathetic rather than nosy like she felt.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So Erin the super-smart, teacher-like
    sister-in-law had a bladder problem?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she
    really did feel sympathetic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In five minutes,
    Erin had gone from intimidating in her appearance and personality, to open and vulnerable
    in her nudity and frankness, to nearly pathetic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Diapers?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to say something.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mom...told us to let you have the
    bathroom,&quot; she stammered awkwardly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin laughed, and they both relaxed
    a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;That was nice of her,&quot; she
    said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Of course, I think she said
    she'd been through this too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Mom?&quot; Maggie said, a bit
    confused now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Mom wears Depends?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin laughed genuinely now.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; she assured Maggie, pulling on
    her jeans over the diapers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;No, Maggie,
    sometimes childbirth can make you incontinent, your muscles get stretched out too much and
    they get weak.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She sounded, Maggie
    thought, a lot like some nurse must have sounded explaining it to her in the hospital.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It doesn't last forever.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You do exercises and usually you're fine in a
    month or two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But if you don't want to live
    in the bathroom until things are back to normal...&quot; She patted her crotch lightly and
    smiled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Trust me, Mags, it's not easy
    but it's not the end of the world.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie nodded.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Gosh, that must be hard.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll bet the drive up here was fun.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By now she was torn between sympathy and a
    perverse enjoyment, thinking of Erin cheerfully struggling not to pee all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Oh, don't worry, I made your
    brother stop at every rest area,&quot; Erin chuckled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm actually almost back to normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>I haven't lost control since the week we brought Andy home.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I still have to go a lot, like every hour or
    so, and I'm supposed to try to hold it longer every time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>So I'm still wearing these just in case.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie was over her pity by now and
    back to feeling awestruck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Wow, Erin,
    you have a great attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All this you have
    to live with for this.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gestured to
    the baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Wow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Erin, still in her bra and jeans,
    walked over and embraced Maggie tightly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's
    worth it, honey, it really is,&quot; she said, looking down at Andy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Besides,&quot; she added with a smile,
    &quot;You know men could never handle it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
    they both laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The rest of that visit was a blur to
    Maggie now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All she remembered was doing her
    best to stay away from the bathroom in case Erin needed it, and being interested in spite
    of herself in how often she - Erin - did need it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
    before Erin and Jonathan had gone home, Maggie was replaying that wonderful encounter in
    her head while alone in her room, imagining Erin's huge, matronly bush and her frequent
    need for the bathroom and her almost complete lack of embarrassment about any of it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That Andy was a lucky kid, Maggie often mused
    after bringing herself to orgasm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It wasn't long afterward that Maggie
    found herself wanting that feeling of relief more often.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Perhaps it wasn't the frequency she craved - that was more than a little bit
    embarrassing at school - but the intensity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Imagining
    Erin on that drive up, fidgeting in her car seat and keeping an eye on her watch and the
    rest area signs, and then the blissful relief that awaited her, never failed to arouse
    Maggie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did the other incidents that
    inadvertently reminded her of Erin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In high
    school it was usually the girls; there seemed to be at least one in every class who always
    had to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In college it was the guys, since
    they did so much drinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And on those
    special nights, it was herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whoever it
    was, though, it never once failed Maggie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Especially not tonight, she thought.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a tiny New York apartment, tiny but cozy
    with the couch by the window, the television jammed tightly between the bookcases against
    the opposite wall and the lush Persian rug in between, all of it just past the
    kitchen-nook just inside the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Books and
    CDs were stacked fairly neatly everywhere, and the lamp on the end table cast a warm glow
    against the dusk outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And at the opposite
    corner from the kitchen was Maggie's bathroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Locking the door, she kicked off her
    shoes and strode over to the bathroom, turning on the light inside and looking happily at
    the readily available toilet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    anticipation, she admired the graceful sight of the pleats of her skirt rippling back and
    forth in the mirror as she found herself wiggling again, the wonderful pressure continuing
    to build.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No bus driver on a schedule, no
    brothers or boyfriends hogging the bathroom, no teacher on a power trip, nothing between
    me and relief except...me, she thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And it was urgent now, but she
    wasn't quite ready to give in just yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
    was, she often found, something about not having any barriers to the bathroom that made it
    seem even more urgent no matter how badly she had to go to begin with.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here it was well over two hours since she'd downed
    all that water, and her bladder felt at least the size of a soccer ball inside her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pleasant discomfort was palpable.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her vagina tingled with sheer anticipation and the
    tickle that seemed to vibrate from there to every far reach of her body, right out to her
    fingertips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't have stopped swaying
    back and forth if someone had offered her a million dollars.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it wasn't quite time yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With the bathroom light on behind
    her, she walked back across the living room - gingerly now, enjoying the urgency but well
    aware of what any sudden moves could do to her sense of control over the situation - and
    switched off the light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bathroom light
    provided a nice afterglow and enough darkness to provide a sense of privacy.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Watching people pass in the street below, Maggie
    reached behind her and unclasped and unzipped her skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She thought of letting it drop gracefully to the floor, and then thought
    better of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bending down to pick it up before it
    got wrinkled would be a genuinely hazardous thing to do right now.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she held the waistband and stepped out,
    as quickly as she could, for she didn't dare keep her legs spread too far for too long
    just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hose were next, and proved even
    dicier to remove.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the blazer, and that
    was enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't nearly warm enough yet
    to strip completely, and besides, she reminded herself, I'm standing in the window.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was, as Erin had put it so many years before,
    not that confident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For the home stretch, Maggie tried
    to stand still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hands on her hips, she
    continued to observe the scene outside and drink in the sensation of her now-tense body.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She couldn't do it for long; both hands moved
    quickly from her hips to between her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sure
    enough, although she hadn't lost any pee yet, her panties were delightfully damp all the
    same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie pressed all of her fingertips
    firmly against her vulva.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It helped.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt the pressure recede ever so slightly and
    she was able to stand still for just a moment longer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Soon enough, she wasn't moving
    anymore, but her fingers were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She exulted in
    the sensation of the pads of her fingers against the soft, nappy cotton, tugging slightly
    at her pubic hair and further exciting her swollen, already agitated skin underneath. <span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Waves of gentle pleasure intermingled with the
    near-violent urge now calling out from within that most intimate part of her body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The limit was reached.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie closed her eyes and shook her head back and
    forth, her dark brown mane brushing both cheeks pleasantly - a sensation she did her best
    to concentrate on in a last-ditch effort to hang on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She now knew without a doubt that if she stopped teasing her clit, the dam
    would burst for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pleasure now
    infused with real fear, she turned and looked to the light across the room, so close but
    yet so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It couldn't be much more than
    seven steps, but she'd have to remember to keep moving her fingers as well as her legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That wouldn't be a problem, she
    realized as soon as she'd begun the trek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soft
    as the rug was, each step seemed like a tragic jolt to her crotch, against which her
    vibrating fingers remained tightly clasped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
    heavens I live alone, she thought as she crossed the threshold.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No need to worry about shutting the door at a time
    like this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Standing over the bowl, for a split
    second Maggie debated her plan of attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
    best to remove her panties?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They'd need to be
    washed anyway, of course, but there was the principle of the thing.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not one drop is escaping into my clothes, she
    vowed, gingerly removing her right hand from ground zero and pulling down the waistband.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Crouching slowly, she tried to calculate the best
    angle and the right moment to release her left hand and pull the panties away with her
    right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was perhaps at a 30-degree angle
    over the seat when she knew the time was right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    pulled the band out nearly down to her knees, and preparing to clench her muscles for all
    she was worth for that last split-second, she released her hand, pulled the garment out of
    the way, and sat down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It wasn't a flood at first.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was more like a trickle.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie hadn't pushed herself that far in so long,
    she'd forgotten how hard it was to actually get started in really desperate cases like
    this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Laughing slightly at this realization,
    she relaxed and let nature take its course, as slowly as it wished.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it wasn't the gusher she was expecting, it
    felt very, very good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost like there was
    still something trying to block the way but not quite succeeding, she thought.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was so sore as her bladder began to relax that
    she couldn't push at first anyway; but it soon became clear that she wouldn't need to.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And sore or not, the sensation of flowing relief
    was divine as always.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Slowly, to a barely perceptible
    degree, she mused, the flow gained strength and momentum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>It was perhaps thirty seconds after Maggie had begun peeing before her
    stream felt reasonably strong, but nature took its course and soon enough she could tell
    she was gushing at full force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still clad in
    her warm top, Maggie nonetheless felt goose bumps on her arms as wave after wave of relief
    emanated throughout her body and the tension seemed to evaporate through every pore.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She shook slightly from the sheer pleasure of the
    nearly orgasmic relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maggie was accustomed
    to the final second or two of spray feeling most pleasurable of all; but this time, that
    intense wave of almost tangible satisfaction lasted for what she judged must have been at
    least twenty seconds before she could even feel the end coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The final drops required just the
    slightest bit of actual effort on Maggie's part, which in that moment was nearly all that
    she could muster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thoroughly finished and
    empty, she nevertheless sat there without moving for what was probably at least another
    minute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was done, she could tell; but her
    bladder still felt distended, tingly and a little sore from the exertion she'd put herself
    through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Total relief remained ever so
    slightly elusive, but for the moment, Maggie leaned back against the tank and smiled.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Beautiful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Beautiful, she thought, but
    unfinished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gathering her strength and
    remembering her unfinished business from before, Maggie wiped her pussy gently, stood up,
    flushed and stretched her arms and gloriously bare legs, smiling naughtily at herself in
    the bathroom mirror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She'd looked so demure
    before in her work clothes, squirming before her image of herself.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, her dark, modest shirt providing a dramatic
    offset for her long legs and gloriously bare, full bush (still smaller than Erin's, but
    beautifully adult, feminine and untrimmed), Maggie the grown up lawyer had a different
    itch to scratch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She hastily rinsed her hands off,
    quite sure though she was that she hadn't leaked on them, and shut the bathroom light off.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The living room and kitchen nook were dim but,
    with the pale light from the street, not too dark to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>With the radiator spitting busily in the corner, the apartment was now
    pleasantly warm and getting warmer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Smiling
    warmly to herself, now, Maggie reached behind her back and pulled her shirt off at last,
    setting it neatly on the floor by the bookcase.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Clad
    only in her forest green bra now, Maggie reached below and resumed brushing one hand
    lightly through her thatch.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As she did so, she walked to the
    kitchen cabinet and pulled out her half-full bottle of 5.99 merlot.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A glass a day will keep your heart healthy, they
    say, she thought.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A lot of things are good
    for you once a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The liquid poured darkly
    into her one clean wine glass, Maggie took the glass in one hand and herself in the other
    and reclined happily on the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    aftermath of her favorite pain still lingered on as her bladder continued to contract back
    to normal, but the teasing from her right hand worked wonders to divert from it.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And as she worked her wrist harder, the change
    from relief to pleasure became clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Time for the grand finale to My Day,
    Maggie thought, setting her wine glass down a bit roughly on the end table and laying all
    the way back on the couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both hands went to
    work, and she rubbed her back against the cushion to jar her bra back and forth, creating
    a wonderful tease as the satin rubbed across her nipples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Without an ounce of pee left in her, she found herself moister than ever all
    the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She wanted it to last all night, or
    so it felt at first.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the rush of
    sensations was just too much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Memories of the
    train ride, the contrast of her demure clothes with her racy thoughts, the flirty glances
    at the kid across the aisle as she crossed her legs, the walk home, the waiting for the
    sake of waiting, the desperation, the relief, the sheer joy of her own body...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Maggie came so hard that for one
    wonderfully scary moment she was sure she'd caught the attention of the entire building
    and wasn't sure if she'd screamed, or just imagined herself doing so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Still breathing heavily, she rolled
    onto her side and curled up, facing across her tiny living room.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Naked, vulnerable, alone, yet safe and gloriously
    free, she closed her eyes and smiled with silent joy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>It was still fairly early in the evening, too early to think about sleeping.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could put my clothes back on and go out, she
    mused, or just put the television on or read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
    we've got to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, all of that could wait
    for now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was her time, and she intended
    to go right on savoring the joy, the memory, and the intense sense of relief.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In spite of her intentions, her eyelids were
    growing heavier by the second as her beautiful body relaxed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">God bless Erin and her weak bladder,
    Maggie thought, drifting off to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
