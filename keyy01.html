    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Hey, all!<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I go to Texas A&amp;M and last night was our first
    viewing session in Film Studies.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We were
    watching Gone With the Wind, which is about 4hrs long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Anyway, the professor asked that none of us leave our seats and disturb the
    class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About 3 hrs into it I noticed that two
    girls in front of me had started whispering to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>One told the other that she &quot;had to pee so bad&quot;. Finally something
    interesting!! <o:p></o:p></span></font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2"
    color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From
    that point on I could not tell you how the movie went, as I was too busy watching this
    girl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a large amount of weight
    shifting and leg twisting going on.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>With
    about 15 minutes left in the movie, I noticed that this girl started whimpering very
    quietly and I could see tears glinting on her face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
    about five minutes left she started moaning softly, put her hands in her crotch and
    started bending over in her chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally
    the movie was over, the lights came on and the professor said we could leave.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luckily I was in the back next to the door on the
    aisle and was able to slip out quickly. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Unfortunately for this girl, she was
    in the second row and almost in the middle of that row (that row was wider than mine which
    is why I was by the door on the end.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Naturally,
    I stood outside waiting for the girl to come out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    she came out, she was openly holding her crotch and was frantically looking for the
    bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She went to the left and found the
    men's restroom and screamed, &quot;I can't find the bathroom, I don't know where it
    is!&quot; and started running down the stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
    course, I followed her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She got downstairs
    and was running across the floor when she stopped, doubled over, and started pissing in
    her pants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She gushed a torrent for about
    five seconds and regained control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She ran
    the rest of the way to the bathroom leaving a nice trail of drips.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I hung around to see the outcome
    from this and another girl came out of the bathroom and said<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Man, it is nasty in there. Some girl ran in
    and peed herself in the middle of the floor.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
    few minutes later, the peed girl came out wiping tears from her face, but wearing a
    strange smirk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pants were completely
    soaked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wetness went from her belt in the
    rear down to the sides of her thighs and all the way down her legs.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She must have just stood there and peed because I
    noticed that her shoes now made cute squishing noises when she walked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Funny thing is- she started joking
    to her friend about how good it felt to pee, even if it was in her pants. I have a feeling
    I will be keeping a close eye on this one.... <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
