    <br>
    Cecily and I were out Saturday dancing, going easy on the drink, but enjoying the motion
    and heat. As usual, she was dressed in her favorite outfit of dark panty hose under a
    very, very short miniskirt and a halter-top that left her navel bare. She wore her long
    brown hair in a rugged ponytail, making her look younger than her twenty-eight years.<o:p></o:p></span></font><p
    class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She wiped the sweat from her
    forehead as we returned to the table, heading for a cold coke. The place was quite
    crowded, and a group of people had sat down right next to us. Cecily nodded at the girl
    beside her, stretched her legs under the table and finished the coke. The girl turned to
    us, saying she hoped it was OK to sit there. It turned out she was not with the group; her
    name was Vicki, and we talked a bit through the music. She was wearing a white t-shirt, no
    bra, and tight jeans, had black hair with a fringe and a ready smile. Early twenties, I
    guessed. When she asked for a dance I nearly rose before I realized she was talking to
    Cecily.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cecily looked quickly at me, and
    stood up, smoothing her skirt. Vicki went first over to the dance floor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I had ordered a couple of beers
    while they were away. They came back looking flushed, and Cecily seemed to need some
    fluids. The girls were talking, I was content to lose myself in the music and wind down
    after a hectic week.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After a while they headed for the
    floor again. I watched them go; similar in height, but Cecily a little bit rounder
    although Vicki had a nice butt in the pocket-less jeans. I'm not ashamed of noticing these
    things; in fact, I could even talk to Cecily about it. Founded on complete trust our
    relationship was not threatened by appreciating the looks of other people.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I saw Vicki head for the bar, and
    Cecily returned to me. &quot;Got yourself a date,&quot; I said teasingly.<br>
    <br>
    She looked at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;This is no joke. She
    fondled my bottom.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;What?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She smiled wonderingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;At first we
    were just moving separately, but then she put her hands on my hips and pulled me closer. I
    could feel her hands trace my panty lines, and I swear she had a finger under my
    skirt.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Small wonder. You look
    absolutely stunning.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But a girl?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Good taste.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;John!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;OK. You mind?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She thought for a second.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Don't know. It was strange. I got all - you
    know, shaky, but felt a little bit scared as well. She said...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cecily took my hand and looked me in
    the eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She said she had no panties
    on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Girl, you have a new
    date.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She kissed me.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Help,&quot; she whispered.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I shook my head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;This is your chance. Do what you feel is right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Vicki sat down beside her again.
    They talked, Vicki emphasizing her points by touching Cecily's arm. Cecily gulped down
    half her beer. Then Vicki grabbed her hand and made her rise.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fifteen minutes later Cecily was
    back, cramming something in her hands. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Even more flushed, brown tresses
    hanging from her head, legs tightly together. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;John!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes, love.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;She wants to take me home.
    She's waiting outside.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Like I said, we have a trusting
    relationship. What would I do? Stand up and make her leave? Demand to come with them? Get
    mad?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I love Cecily. It's as simple as that.
    &quot;Go,&quot; I said, squeezing her hands, which were holding some thin fabric. &quot;If
    you want to. What happened?&quot;<span style="mso-tab-count:1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She bit her lip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;She said she was almost peeing her pants, and did I want to go with
    her? She just pulled me along, into a cubicle, and stood looking at me. She was squeezing
    her legs, holding her belly. You go first, she said. I almost wet myself. She watched me,
    and stroked my knees while I was peeing. And-&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;She asked me to take my panties off.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Before I could ask if she complied,
    she thrust something damp and frilly into my hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;John,
    I must be crazy. I got turned on watching her pee.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Be crazy,&quot; I said with a
    silly-looking grin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Enjoy
    yourself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Sure?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-Love you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She kissed me hard and left.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Past midday on Sunday she came home,
    quite silent, but giving me an extra hug and looking deeply into my eyes. She changed into
    leggings and a sweater, and sat down in a chair. Got up again, and sat next to me in the
    sofa.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You're incredible.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;No, you are,&quot; I said,
    putting my arm around her. &quot;It was weird,&quot; she said softly.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Walking away with her. She held my hand like
    it was all a matter of course. I was so turned on, and could feel the nylon against my
    fanny with every step. Inside her apartment she led me to the living room, got out a
    bottle of white wine and two glasses, and we cuddled up on the sofa. 'Cecily, she said, Do
    you want to sleep with me?' I didn't have to answer; she just kissed me.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Soft kisses, I could smell her perfume and a soft
    girl smell. I felt her breasts against mine and put my hands on her hips. When she slid a
    hand along the inside of my legs I almost wet myself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
    &nbsp; </span>Cecily took my hand and stared into space. -She put on some slow music, and
    we danced. Belly against belly, cheek to cheek. All the while she stroked the skin on my
    back, and I couldn't resist holding her butt. Feeling the roundness. Sniffing the scent of
    her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I had to pee. She asked me to wait.
    Said she had to go too, but loved to hold on for as long as she could. Loved the feeling
    of a full bladder, anticipating the release. Sometimes I wet my jeans a bit, she said. She
    asked if I had ever done it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Did you tell her?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cecily put her head on my shoulder.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I told her about that time we missed the
    last bus and had to walk, and by the time we were home my shorts were soaking. She said
    she loved the thought of that. She wished she had seen me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;By then I was bursting for a
    wee. She took me to the bedroom, put some towels on the bed, and made me lie down.
    She...&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Yes, love?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;She stroked me through the
    pantyhose, and I couldn't help peeing myself. I was so embarrassed. She pulled my skirt
    off, kissed my face and said it was all right to let go in my pants. Would I feel better
    if she wet herself too? She sat cross-legged, and I watched while she peed in her jeans.
    Then she touched me again and - John, I wet her bed. And then I put my hand in her jeans
    and fingered her. Touched another girl's fanny. She was shaved, John. Not a hair on her.
    And her pee was warm against my hand. Girl pee. I loved it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Cecily fondled my hand.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We slept in each other's arms all night. Woke up,
    stroked each other, kissed nipples, she kissed my fanny. Afterwards we showered, peeing on
    each other's hands, and had breakfast just like an ordinary couple. She lent me a pair of
    panties and a dry pair of pantyhose. Said I could give it back some time if I wanted
    to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cecily looked at me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Do you want to?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She thought for a while.
    &quot;Maybe. But I have been missing something. Something that a girl cannot give
    me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I sensed her hand on me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But I think I need a
    towel.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
