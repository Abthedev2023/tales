    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From the time Nancy was nine years
    old she had accompanied her father on fishing trips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In fact the whole family
    occasionally went along and they picnicked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy's
    father was an avid fly fisherman and since Nancy was like all young daughters she wanted
    to engage in her fathers favorite pastime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
    she was thirteen she was an accomplished fly fisherman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>By the time she reached fourteen, her parents had divorced.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy was sent to live with her mother.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was devastated; she loved being with her Dad.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After that, she was only able to see him
    sporadically, due to school and his work schedule. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One Friday evening after Nancy had
    reached the age of eighteen her father called and asked if she wanted to go trout fishing
    early Saturday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He and his favorite
    fishing buddy Ned were going and he thought she might like to go, as they hadn't been able
    to spend much time together lately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    hadn't been fishing since before the divorce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
    were butterflies in Nancy's chest!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Dear God
    she thought, how long have I waited for such an invitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She had evidently proven herself capable somewhere along the way and now it
    was paying off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course she loved her dad
    and wanted to be with him as much as possible and there was Ned whom she thought of as an
    uncle, a good looking one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy was awake two hours early but
    she bided her time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Breakfast consisted of
    an energy packed granola bar and orange juice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
    father picked her up. <o:p></o:p> En route to the stream coffee was acquired.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They hit the stream by 0700 and fished all the
    morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy chose her flies carefully and
    it paid off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p> She had the greatest number of
    fish when they quit around noon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was so
    pleased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she didn't come close to
    the largest fish; that went to <o:p></o:p>Ned and her father also had one very close to Ned's in
    size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, both Dad and <o:p></o:p>Ned praised her catch
    along with the fact that she was choosing the right flies and using them correctly.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They said that she had really turned into a great
    fisherman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nancy spent the rest of the day
    basking in the glory of showing up her favorite fishermen.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The plan had been to stop at The
    Grill on the way home for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The <o:p></o:p>Grill
    was about halfway along the two-hour drive home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    prospect of a juicy cheeseburger and fries suited Nancy just fine.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, as they started back, the prospect of a
    bathroom also suited Nancy fine.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It had been five hours since Nancy
    had used a bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there hadn't
    been much liquid consumed during that time there was still an urge.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nancy had always had a little
    trouble announcing to her father that she needed to go to the bathroom but she usually did
    so in the end. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Her bashfulness was
    compounded several degrees due to Ned's presence as well as being the only female.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So when they loaded up to start back Nancy did not
    mention her concern with having with a full bladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She was sure she could make it to <o:p></o:p>The Grill.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Fifteen minutes into that one-hour
    trip she was having doubts about her capacity. She had been shifting all over the back
    seat of the station wagon, crossing and recrossing her legs.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She knew she should just tell her dad but she just
    couldn't.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither her dad nor Uncle Ned had
    gone all day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was Uncle Ned's
    presence that kept her from saying anything more than any other factor.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She just couldn't let Ned know that she couldn't
    hold her water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, she was the
    fisherman of the day.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Thirty minutes later she had reached
    the final level of desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She slid
    herself into a position in the back seat where no one could see her and she proceeded to
    hold herself with her hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She then crossed
    her legs over her hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This has to work, she
    thought, for I am not going to say that I can't hold it any longer.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I get to The Grill it will all be over.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>Please God let me hold on a bit longer, she
    prayed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was at that point that she lost
    all control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pee flowed out past her hand for
    all of two seconds before she regained control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
    control was tenuous as her bladder was sore and tired from being restrained.<span
    style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked down and saw a dark stain in her
    crotch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt behind her buttocks and
    thighs and noted they were sodden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had
    undoubtedly wet herself and it would be obvious to anyone who saw her.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What am I going to do?<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>Oh God, Uncle Ned will know that I peed
    myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What am I going to do?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">They were pulling into the parking
    lot of The Grill and she still didn't know what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>She decided that she wasn't going into The Grill no matter how hungry she
    was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Her wet pants would remain her secret
    and that was that.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her dad and Ned had gotten out and
    she remained in the back seat of the station wagon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad
    opened the back door and said, &quot;Aren't you coming in?&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;No, she answered, I'm tired and I think I'll
    stay here.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Aren't you
    hungry?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Come on in and have a
    great meal.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm not so hungry, maybe you
    can bring me a burger.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her dad stuck his head into the door
    and asked if she was feeling okay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew
    something was wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he gently asked,
    &quot;Did you have an accident?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    bowed her head and began to cry and said,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Yes.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her daddy said that it was all right and that he
    understood why it happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You just
    waited a bit too long. It'll be OK,&quot; said he.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Please don't make me get out
    of the car,&quot; she pleaded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;You
    have to,&quot; he said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm sure you
    still have to go.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Everybody will
    laugh at me,&quot; said Nancy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
    Uncle Ned won't like me anymore.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Nonsense,&quot;
    said her father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    and your jeans are dark.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Chances
    are that no one will even notice.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;And
    as for Ned, he thinks of you as his daughter.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You have absolutely nothing to
    worry about.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I'm so ashamed.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought I could hold it but I couldn't.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't help it. It wasn't my fault.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just couldn't hold it.&quot;<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was frantic and a bit out of control.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her father grabbed her by the shoulders and
    shook her and he calmly said &quot;You are going to walk into The Grill and you are going
    to the restroom to finish relieving yourself and then you are going to join Ned and I for
    a delicious meal.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Any crying you
    feel you have to do will be done after you get home.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    &nbsp; </span>&quot;Is that understood?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
    weakly nodded in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"

    a dark spot the size of a saucer appeared in the front of the crotch of her jeans and when
    she walked away the seat of her jeans was wet from the buttocks to almost the back of her
    knees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He felt so sorry for her that he
    didn't know what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went up to her and
    gave her a big hug. When she had finished relieving herself and they were all ensconced in
    a booth Ned told a story on himself when he was Nancy's age.<span
