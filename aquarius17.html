    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a garden party, something to
    do with film; one of those mill-around-and-be-seen-things where you talk to people you
    don't know about nothing at all while you wait for somebody important to drift by. I'm
    something like the second unit's third cameraman's focus puller's assistant, which makes
    me the one you don't know. I got tired of hearing about nothing at all, so I drifted
    around the corner in search of the third unit's fourth sound recorder's microphone cleaner
    or so, hoping she was female and unattached.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The woman stepped out from behind
    the hedge, shoes in one hand, and tall glass in the other. Unsteadiness more from the
    contents of the glass, or the ones before that, than from walking barefoot - it was a very
    smooth lawn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Hi, she said, smiling as if I were
    somebody. The smile lit up a beautiful face, late thirties, perhaps, framed by wavy red
    hair. She wore an incredibly tight black dress, bosom to ankles, had bare arms and no
    jewelry. She didn't need it. -Marina, she said, extending a hand, keeping the smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Jerry, I answered. -I'm the second
    unit's - <o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Never mind, she said. -I'm just
    somebody's wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So much for luck, I thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Join me in a drink?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-All right. I'll get you something
    from the -<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-No, no. I've brought my own. She
    pulled a flask from a minimal purse, filled her glass and handed it to me. Straight vodka.
    I regained my breath and gave her the glass back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Boring place, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Up till now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She smiled again. -Old lines die
    hard. But yeah, you're the first human-looking creature I've met today too. Excuse me
    while I put my shoes back on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She put a hand on my shoulder to
    steady herself, bent down and slipped her feet into the rather impractical high-heeled
    strap things. The fabric of her dress stretched; I could swear there was absolutely
    nothing underneath it. Straightening up, lifting her chest, part of my assumption was
    confirmed. -Drink again?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I accepted, sipping carefully this
    time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Are you alone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Yes, I said. -And your... is he...<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-He's probably fucking some catering
    girl right now, she said with a tilt of the smooth neck. -So my... she waved, -is... wave
    again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Well, I said, catching on, -that
    makes two of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Bad line again. You should be the
    leading man in the next production.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-You think our films are really so
    bad?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Why do they need so much time to
    get to the fucking, then?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This film discussion was beyond
    anything I was used to hearing. -Beats me, I said. -What's a beautiful girl like you doing
    in a hedge like this?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I had to remove my tights. I peed
    myself waiting for the loo. Any stains on the dress?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She turned around slowly, rounded
    buttocks moving freely under the fabric. -No, I said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Good. But then, stains don't show
    up well on black. That's why I prefer that. Nothing on the front, either?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She pushed her hips forward. I saw
    the small dent of her navel, the curve of her belly, the hipbones, and the shape of her
    mound under the dress. No stains, and I said so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-It just went down my legs, she
    informed me, -and I couldn't help it. My bladder is the size of a peanut, and when I have
    to go, I really have to go. I was conversing with this bloke, waiting in line, and then I
    just felt it coming. He was staring dumbly as I walked away, legs rubbing, leaving small
    drops on the floor. Thank God for dark hallways. Another drink?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I shook my head, and she looked
    grateful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Anyway, I made it to the hedge,
    removed my shoes and tights, hitched up my dress and squatted. Then I heard you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-I would have loved to see you, I
    said. -An attractive woman peeing is a very sensual sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-It's a very sensual experience,
    too, she said. -Baring my butt, sprinkling the grass, wearing nothing under this tight
    dress. Like it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Beautiful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-It's so tight you might even be
    able to see my body hairs; she smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Fortunately I don't have any. She
    touched her mound lightly, shuddering. -Want to fuck?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">My tie started choking me. -Uh -
    where?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Tool shed. Come on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was right. No body hairs, all
    smooth lines and curves, a fit body knowing its own desires and gifts. Behind the locked
    doors she slid out of her dress, removed my clothing with impatient hands, and took
    control. She purred, cursed, moaned and screamed until we were totally exhausted. With
    thumping hearts we dressed, checked each other for telltale marks, and left. Outside she
    clung to me again, I felt her hips against me and stroked her buttocks through the dress.
    - I want to pee on the grass again, she whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We went behind the hedge. She
    wriggled her dress up over her hips, letting me see her beautiful naked slit where the
    curves of her thighs met. The smell of sex drifted to my nostrils. She sank to her
    haunches, spread her legs slightly, and released her stream with a sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the last drops hit the grass
    she reached for my hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">-Please wipe me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
