    Line</strong><br>
    </font><p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span
    lang="EN-US" style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John's attention was directed past
    the bright lights, the loud, thumping music and the hordes of drunken teenagers and young
    adults. He was concentrating on a girl in the queue, the same as he did every night.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He had spotted tonight's girl almost
    immediately. She was dressed for fun, all bright colors. A super-short, bright green
    skirt, a tiny pink bikini top, and her chestnut hair bunched up into lots of little
    pigtails, each dyed with a splash of purple and tied up with rainbow-colored woolly bands,
    just enough to let a few loose strands brush her shoulders.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She had been in line for almost
    twenty minutes now. When John had initially spotted her she was right at the back; now she
    was nearer to the ladies' room door, but he wasn't sure whether or not she would make it
    through. She was already dancing her knee badly; she already had her bottom lip firmly
    bitten, and her hands were already wringing together.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He let his mind's voice laugh
    loudly, but kept his face steady as rock. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From way over here, nobody had any
    idea he was watching her. They couldn't even see him. Everyone was too wrapped up in their
    own friends and their own drinks to spot him, and after all, he looked exactly like one of
    them. He, and he alone, knew what was going to happen to the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There was only one person in front
    of her now. She closed her eyes and bent at the knees, saying something urgent to the
    ceiling, although John couldn't hear her voice, of course. He imagined it would be a soft,
    friendly voice. He tilted his head to get a better view of the girl. She was quite
    remarkable. She looked about nineteen or twenty, neither underweight nor over, and so her
    figure was smooth, flowing, and absolute. She probably knew how good she looked. Her face
    was beautiful as well. A face suited to smiling, with a little button of a nose and a
    mouth that would feel like silk under the run of his fingertips. Not that he would ever
    touch her. John decided to call her Silk, in his mind, so that he knew her better. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now, her smile was gone, and instead
    she had a look that suggested internal panic. She kept looking around, to see if anyone
    was watching, and someone always was.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Behind her, the queue was getting
    longer. She was close to the front, but behind her another five girls had joined the
    queue. Not one of them seemed like they were in trouble, but perhaps that was by
    comparison to Silk. Someone came out of the ladies' room and walked away to join her
    friends. Silk watched her go. Whoever the woman was, she was empty. Silk longed to be
    empty. Her eyes closed as the girl in front of her walked easily in, not displaying half
    the need Silk felt: a casual visitor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Silk was desperate, and a casual
    visitor was in before her. John got ready.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Silk's knees pressed and rubbed
    together. Her hand, screwed up into a fist, waved by her side in a silent threat as she
    curtsied down three times, without any kind of steady rhythm. Her eyes were closed and her
    face was pointing upwards. John could see that she was starting to reach that point beyond
    hope, where any further delay would be unthinkable, where she could not possibly wait any
    longer.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Another two girls joined the queue
    behind Silk. There were now eight women in the line, and Silk was the first. But she
    didn't seem able to wait for the girl in front to finish. Her legs were pressed together
    hard and her thighs were squeezing to try and touch, to try and fill in all the space.
    There wasn't much longer.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John raised his right hand slightly,
    preparing.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The bathroom door opened and the
    girl stepped out, shaking the last drops of water from her hands. Silk breathed a heavy
    sigh and started forward in a hobble, desperately trying to hold on as she went. Her
    breathing was erratic.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John grinned, and snapped his
    fingers.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Silk collided with another girl's
    back. They both yelped with surprise, and apologized to one another. Silk curtsied again
    to stem the sudden rush that the surprise brought on, and then opened her eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She was at the back of the line. She
    was girl number eight. She could hardly take it in. She looked around her and in front,
    and yes, there were seven other girls in front of her, one just disappearing through the
    door now.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her teeth clenched together and her
    eyes widened. What was going on? How could she be here? Had she wished so hard to be at
    the front of the queue that she had for a moment believed that she was?<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In the background, John laughed
    quietly to himself. He never got tired of doing this.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Silk looked around her in a last
    desperate attempt to find an escape route, but she was cornered in. The crowds around her
    were impermeable. She forced one hand in between her thighs and clamped it firmly in,
    bending at the waist. There was no way she was going to be able to hold on now.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People were beginning to notice her. A couple of
    men stood nearby, gesturing toward her to alert their friends. The two women in front of
    her saw her distress, and allowed her to stand in front of them in the line, but still the
    waiting went on.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She seemed sometimes to have a
    moment when she was all right. She would stand up again, with her legs firmly together
    still, only to have to jam her hand back in place seconds later.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">After ten minutes had gone by, Silk
    was frantically looking around her again. She was third in the line. The two girls who had
    just gone in were together, and were taking a long time, probably putting on makeup or
    talking to one another. They shouldn't be allowed to do that.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The people were all around her,
    jostling. John could not see her for the moment. He caught a glimpse of her green skirt
    through a gap in the crowd and judged how near she was to the bathroom. For a brief
    moment, he even saw her suddenly double-up and stamp her right foot.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He smiled, and snapped his fingers.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once again, she was suddenly at the
    back of the line. It had gone down now to only four people, then her. She cried out in
    alarm and turned her back on the room, facing the wall along which the line ran. Both
    hands disappeared in front of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her legs
    twisted and squirmed together. By the time she was able to let go of herself and turn
    back, her cheek was wet with a tear of frustration.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John decided to let her be. Perhaps
    he had toyed with her long enough. She was biting and releasing her bottom lip and showing
    her teeth, sucking in the air. She would not last for much longer.<span
    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes passed, ten, and finally Silk was at
    the front of the line. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The woman who had been in before her
    stepped out, and it was finally her turn. She visibly drew in breath, and squeezed hard
    with the one hand, which was still locked in place. She seemed unwilling to move, but then
    finally she made a dash for the door, that one hand still in place, running with tiny
    steps, using the other hand to push the door open as she went.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She disappeared inside the bathroom
    door, which swung closed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John waited, one second, then two,
    three...<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And that was enough. He snapped his
    fingers, and turned his back. Across the other end of the dance floor, Silk fell from a
    sitting position in mid-air onto the ground, with her underwear around her ankles. She
    sprang back up. A spray hit the ground between her feet. Red-faced and open-mouthed, she
    glanced around her. Nobody was watching. Nobody except John.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She kicked the underwear from her
    feet and ran, one hand over her mouth, the other jammed between her legs, to the open
    doors of the nightclub. She barged through the people who stood in the way and pushed
    others aside. With a snap of his fingers, John placed her against another wall at the side
    of the dance floor. The beat of the music pounded through the feet and up the legs of
    everyone in the room.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Still she ran. Again John moved her
    further from the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She jammed both hands
    between her legs and doubled-up. She grabbed at her hair and stamped with both feet,
    screwing shut her eyes and looking up to the ceiling. As she did a jet streaked down her
    leg, then another down the other leg. Droplets hit the floor. She opened her mouth then
    snapped her teeth together again.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Her hands went to the back of her
    neck, as the jets became a spray, hitting her ankles, the floor, and the front of her tiny
    skirt, which darkened in patches.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It fell freely, into the puddle that
    was already seeping out around her. People had noticed her now. She began to sink to a
    crouch, covering her face with her hands. The spray settled into a steady flow, which
    continued to wet the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">A hand clapped suddenly down on
    John's shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Again, John? How many times do
    we have to warn you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Well what else am I supposed
    to do?&quot; He turned, and grinned into the reprimanding eyes of Jake, who he knew very
    well.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;You have responsibility. I
    know you landed a rough job, desperation isn't the most enviable power to hold, I know.
    But you could at least keep it in people's homes, where they can deal with it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;But I have to have some fun!
    Look at you; you're the God of Bass Beats. That's fun; you get to party all night. But me,
    well this is all I can do! I have to make my entertainment some way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;That might have been true two
    hundred years ago, but things have changed now. You could really spoil these people's
    enjoyment!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Save your speeches for someone
    like Eric. What's he again, God of...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Flatulence,&quot; Jake
    confirmed. &quot;You're right, whoever started the idea of having a God for absolutely
    everything has a lot to answer for. Listen, just, that's enough for tonight, okay?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">John grinned, and began to walk
    away, toward the door. &quot;Okay, Jake.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;I mean it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;See you tomorrow night!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As he stepped outside and set off up
    the cold street, he laughed to himself, just imagining Jake's face as he shouted
    obscenities at the door. Same as every night.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
