    FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><p></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Hi
    there,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I wanted to tell you about my experience in
    the park yesterday. Now I really like to pee myself, even in public occasionally, but I am
    usually prepared - like I have a spare pair of panties at work or in my handbag. But today
    was different. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I like to walk in the park sometimes at
    lunch to keep in shape. I was doing my usual, wearing a pair of short black tights (which
    show my butt nicely) and a drab grey shirt. I had taken an hour for lunch so I could do a
    slightly longer walk, feeling a little guilty for all the chocolate I had eaten the day
    before - I like the fact both guys and girls look twice at me sometimes, and don't want to
    lose that!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Well, I was kind of busting to pee, but I
    persisted on, knowing that in the middle of the botanical gardens there is a toilet - I
    walk along the waterfront, around the gardens and back to work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Well, as I got there, a sign was up 'closed
    for maintenance' - on the girls' only! Shit! I was by now in a little pain, and I knew
    that I didn't really have long - and there was no way I would make it back to work. I
    decided to try for the Meyer center - about 3 blocks away (the only other choice was the
    guys, but I couldn't bring myself to go there).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Even before I got out of the park a little
    spurt came out of me - but I kept going. By the end of the first block I knew I would not
    make it, so I went back to the park, hoping to find a quiet spot - the only problem was it
    was lunch hour and it was a little warmer than the past few days, so there were plenty of
    people hanging around! I headed for a semi-quiet spot I knew, but there were two couples
    making out on the grass, and no chance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">By now, I was getting a little dribble each
    step, my pants were soaked and it was starting to run down my leg - and I was still in
    pain! at least it didn't show too much on the black (but I could sure feel every drip).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I then headed for the &quot;hill&quot;
    where heaps of people go to sun bake - it was my last chance. I found a spot which was
    about 10 meters from anyone else, about the quietest it was going to be - laid on the
    grass, spread my legs and let it go. It felt so good to pee, and I was becoming turned on
    because I was in public - but was a little worried knowing I would have to go back to work
    in soaked pants before I could change (and I had no spare panties anyway - only my work
    skirt).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">I shut my eyes and let it all go, and when
    I was done opened them - only to see a girl standing about 3 meters away, staring at my
    crotch! she could obviously see my pee gushing out - when she saw me look, she went all
    red and rushed away...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">And that was my lunch hour - peeing in the
    public park, with a girl watching me! I waited until after lunch was over, and managed to
    get a lift back to my floor with only one other girl in it - who looked at me funny and
    then got off. So I made it, and it was probably the most exciting pee I have ever had.</font></p>

    Love </font></p>
