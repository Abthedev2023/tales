    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It was a hot July night and a very
    popular band was playing at an outdoor concert in the park. My friend Jess, and our dates
    Mark and Brad were all going to go with me to the concert. It started at 9pm, but at about
    7pm we all met at Mark's house to have a few drinks before we left. There would be a beer
    gardens there but we wanted to get buzzed before we got there. Since it was a warm night
    Jess and I were both wearing tank tops, me with a skirt and her with shorts. Both the guys
    just had on t-shirts and khaki shorts. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">We started with a couple shots each
    and then switched to beer, we didn't want to mix hard liquor with beer once we got there.
    We each had 2 beers and then it was time to go, we were going to take the bus since none
    of us would be in a state to drive later on. We each filled up a colored water bottle with
    beer and all went pee about 15-20 minutes before we left. </span></font><img

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once we were on the bus, the ride
    was only about 20 minutes; we all easily finished of our bottles of beer. We arrived down
    there quite early and the line up was already half way around the building but after
    standing for a few minutes we saw that it was moving quite quickly. After a few minutes we
    were all laughing and having a good time, there were tons of people partying and drinking
    in line. When we got a little closer to the front I had the urge to pee, I knew I could
    hold it for a bit longer, I have a fairly strong bladder but I would have to find one when
    we got in. I looked at Jess and she kinda laughed and said &quot;Man, I sure have to piss,
    i hope we can find a bathroom soon!!&quot;</span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As if on cue, Brad pointed up ahead
    and said there was bathrooms right ahead. He said, &quot;I need to go, 2 people can go and
    the other 2 can hold our place in line and take turns. Jess exclaimed, &quot;Ok, I need to
    go too, come on Brad&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></font><img src="http://members.easyshag.com/femaledesperation/bigimages/auburn02.jpg" width="320"

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mark and I groaned but agreed,
    having to wait not much longer. They ran off and came back not a minute later. &quot;They
    are locked, we will have to wait until we are inside&quot; Brad said, obviously incredibly
    disappointed and in desperate need of relieving himself. Secretly a part of me was glad, I
    was enjoying the predicament, if only I did not have to go so bad as well. The line
    continued to move and soon we were almost at the gate to get in. As we were being searched
    and let thru, I asked security were the bathrooms were. He explained that they were on the
    other side of the grounds and pointed the direction. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Once we all got in, we were all
    obviously in a great need of a piss; we wanted to stay all together and made our way
    quickly thru the crowds. The bathrooms were porta potties secluded behind trees and it
    seemed that a great deal of people had the same predicament. There were about 10 stalls
    all in a row and in each line there was about 5 - 6 people, lots of which had their legs
    crossed and one that was openly holding herself. &quot;Oh shit, i cannot wait, I will have
    to go against the fence behind them&quot; Brad cried. Jess said &quot;I don't think so,
    you'll have to wait in line with us, us girls cannot go and do that.&quot; Brad moaned but
    then got into the next line over with Jess. Mark and I stayed together, making an
    agreement that we would go in at the same time and he would pee in the sink or between my
    legs if he had to. He was hunched over, occasionally reaching into his pocket and
    squeezing himself. We hadn't been seeing each other for very long and this was the first
    time I had seen him like this, it was actually a huge turn on. Jess was jumping up and
    down openly holding herself. She yelled for the people ahead to hurry up. Brad bent over
    and looked like he was going to piss anytime, &quot;I have never had to go so bad in my
    life.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Soon we were second in line and Brad
    and Ashley were still third. There were 2 guys beside us that could not sit still and kept
    announcing loudly that they had to piss. Soon, one guy raced behind the porta potties
    unzipping his pants as he went. The other guy quickly followed and when they came out
    there was only one person ahead of us. When they returned one of them said to us &quot;One
    of the good things about being a guy!&quot; obviously enjoying Jess and my dilemma.
    &quot;Why don't you guys do the same??&quot; they asked Mark and Brad, laughing as they
    walked by. Brad looked like he would have said something back if he didn't have to pee so
    badly. Soon they were next in line as well and all of us were doubled over and openly
    holding ourselves. &quot;I have never had to go so bad in my life&quot; Jess cried. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When the person ahead of us came out
    we both raced inside leaving Brad and Jess still waiting. I immediately had my skirt up
    and my panties down. Mark had his shorts down quickly and was squeezing his penis very
    hard trying to cut of the flow just 30 seconds longer. The sink was clogged so I sat down
    and spread my legs wide, leaving Mark enough room to pee if his aim was good. I
    immediately started to pee, a very strong stream. Seeing me, Mark almost let go; he was
    concentrating very hard on trying not to pee on me. Soon, a small stream began as our
    streams combined together as one. His stream grew into a steady force and piss began to
    splash on my legs.&quot; You have to slow it down&quot; I said sternly &quot;You are
    getting me wet&quot; He groaned and used all his force to bring it down and after about 30
    seconds he was done. Now that we both felt better I got up and I gave him a romantic kiss.
    We went outside to find that Jess and Brad must have gotten in. When they came out they
    both looked relieved. &quot;Man, I cannot believe I held that for that long, I thought I
    was going to piss myself&quot; Brad said. We all went to get a drink but knew to give
    ourselves plenty of time to get to the bathroom for the rest of the night!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><span lang="EN-US"
    style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Later I asked Jess how they had
    peed. She told me that she had peed first while he watched and that it had turned her on
    that he had been such a gentleman even though he was obviously pushing his limits.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
