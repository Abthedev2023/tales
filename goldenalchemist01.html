    The warm morning breeze played through Jenny's chestnut colored hair as she rode her
    bicycle down the beach boardwalk and then off to the side trail that led down to the river
    and marina next to the seashore. It was Jenny's first day on the job at the Jet Ski rental
    booth and she was excited to be back in her hometown for the summer. The beach town was
    always an awesome place to be when the weather was warm and the boardwalk and surrounding
    shops were pulsating with activity all day and most of the night. Restaurants, bars,
    tattoo parlours, and bikini shops were filled with people here during the summer months
    and Jenny never missed an opportunity to be a part of it. Jenny had just turned 19 a few
    weeks earlier and had celebrated an end-of-school bash with her sorority sisters at the
    university campus upstate where she had just finished her freshman year. In fact, some of
    those same girls were planning to come visit her next week. She had told them how awesome
    her hometown was. Jenny smiled as she remembered her wild year as a sorority girl...the
    things she had done, the craziness, the parties. She wondered if her mother had any idea,
    but then realized that she probably didn't even care. It was all part of being young, and
    Jenny was living it up!<br>
    <br>
    The trail meandered a few more feet and down a steep incline to the river. Jenny felt her
    bladder twitch as she went over a rock. She parked her bike next to the small hut and dock
    with the sign that read &quot;Jerry's Jet Ski Rental.&quot; Jenny grabbed her knapsack and
    water bottle and wished that she hadn't drunk that extra cup of coffee this morning with
    her mother. Still, she was almost late for her first day and didn't want to make a bad
    impression to Jerry. She would find the toilet later, after introducing herself. Jenny
    walked up to the entrance to the hut and found Jerry inside taking inventory.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hi&quot; she said, &quot;I'm Jenny.&quot; Jerry looked up from his list and was
    happy with what he saw. He had told Jenny over the phone that the job was mostly outdoors,
    helping out tourists with the jet skis and that she should dress accordingly. Jenny was
    only all too happy to wear her surf short bikini; she had just bought it the day before
    and was looking forward to wearing her entire collection of bikinis at work throughout the
    summer. She figured the surf short bikini style was conservative enough to make a good
    first impression. It consisted of tight shorts that just covered her butt cheeks and a
    bandeau-style top with ties at both the front and the back. The cobalt blue material had a
    slight shimmer to it that complemented Jenny's tanned and toned physique. Jerry's eyes
    were also focused on Jenny's little Playboy bunny belly piercing that she had gotten after
    last year's sorority initiation, and Jerry quietly wondered if she had piercings in any
    other places. Jenny caught Jerry staring and cheerfully giggled, &quot;Sir, I'm here on
    time, ready to work!&quot; Jerry regained his composure and hoped his growing erection
    wasn't too visible through his loose beach shorts. &quot;Yes, absolutely, let's get you
    started,&quot; he said.<br>
    <br>
    Jerry himself was a good-looking man with blonde hair. He had just turned 40 and had owned
    the Jet Ski shop for the past 10 years. Every year he put an ad up at the local grocery
    store looking for an assistant and immediately skipped right past all the guys who
    applied. He could handle the heavy work himself, he just needed a fresh face at the hut to
    convince guys (and gals) to part with their dollars on a rental, and maybe even a lesson
    or two. His last assistant was a real looker too but she had an attitude that Jerry just
    couldn't get along with. He was happy that she wasn't coming back this year. Jerry could
    sense though that Jenny would be different. Of course she was beautiful, but she also had
    an innocence about her and he sensed that she wouldn't be trouble.<br>
    <br>
    For the next two hours, Jerry gave Jenny a crash course in how to handle rental contracts,
    moor the jet skis, and give basic lessons. Jenny already knew how to ride, she had learned
    a few summers ago when her mother won a jet ski in a community raffle. She loved the
    feeling of going over the waves and the water splashing up all around her, and so she was
    very happy when Jerry told her that every morning before opening, she would have to take
    each jet ski out on the water and make sure it was in top running condition.<br>
    <br>
    Ten o' clock came and Jerry opened the Jet Ski shop for business. Jenny still hadn't peed
    yet; in fact with all the information and training that Jerry was giving her she had
    almost forgotten that she needed to. As she took her post behind the huts counter, Jerry
    wished her luck and went around back to attend to a &quot;plumbing matter.&quot; Jenny
    wasn't quite sure what that meant but then realized that she had never gotten around to
    asking Jerry where the toilets were. &quot;I'll be ok until lunch,&quot; she thought,
    &quot;I'm a big girl.&quot; Still, Jenny felt herself squeeze her thighs together a little
    more tightly. She found a stool to sit on and crossed her legs. &quot;There, that should
    help,&quot; she thought as the pressure in her bladder subsided. Within a few minutes the
    first customers of the summer arrived. They were two young guys in their twenties, both
    well tanned and muscular. Jenny was impressed, but soon realized that they were more
    preoccupied with getting out on the water than they were with her. She wrote up their
    rental contracts and untied two jet skis from their moorings. Within minutes both men were
    off and down the river. Jenny sighed and went back to her hut. Walking around had made her
    urge to pee a little stronger again and she decided to see what Jerry was up to. She
    walked around the back of the hut to discover a small washroom with Jerry on his knees
    inside of it, removing a large pipe. &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; Jenny said. Jerry looked
    up, admired Jenny's youthful beauty again, and replied, &quot;The damn toilet's broke. It
    must've froze up in the winter and the pipe has a crack in it...leaked water all over the
    place. You'll have to tell people to go up and use the beach washrooms on the boardwalk if
    they need to.&quot; Jenny felt her bladder jump again at this news and she winced. The
    boardwalk washrooms were at least ten minutes away from the hut and she didn't think it
    would be wise to ask for a break so early into her shift. Jenny said &quot;Oh, that sucks,
    hope you fix it soon,&quot; and then walked back around to her stool in front of the
    counter. She made a mental note to herself to always pee from now on before leaving home
    in morning, and for the first time that day the thought that she might wet herself became
    apparent. Jenny remembered the few times that she had peed her pants in the past year -
    the sorority initiation, Halloween night, and St. Patrick's day. Still all those times
    were when she was really drunk and a lot of other girls in her sorority ended up wet those
    nights too. It was funny then, but she quickly realized it wouldn't be so funny if it
    happened now at work on her first day. Jenny squeezed her thighs together again and
    inadvertently found herself putting her finger down to her pee hole to see if there was
    anything dribbling out. She was still dry down there, besides her natural lubrication. She
    wondered how long that would last. Jenny composed herself and pulled a book out of her
    knapsack hoping to preoccupy her mind with other things than her growing need to pee.<br>
