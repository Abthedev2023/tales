      <P class="small">This story is laid mostly in an internee camp of 1942, 
        through the recollections of a former female inmate, and told somewhat 
        in flashback style. The story itself is fiction, but incorporates much 
        of what has been written by real persons with similar experiences. It 
        involves mild bondage (internment), watersports, exhibitionism, and consensual 
        sex involving two very full bladders. <BR>

        Emily Vorgstrom stood before the crowd of students, assembled to hear 
        her recount her wartime experiences as an internee in the Far East during 
        World War II. It was something she found herself doing more frequently 
        lately, for the passage of time had seemed to reawaken an interest in 
        those long-ago events among the younger generation. Emily had become active 
        in social and political affairs in recent years, and had developed a talent 
        for public speaking. Her war experiences were a frequent topic she was 
        asked to discuss.<BR>
        <BR>
        She had addressed this group of students for nearly an hour, going over 
        the events through which she had lived, and its relevance to present times, 
        at least as she saw them. She always enjoyed the interest the audience 
        showed, particularly younger ones. This time, her husband Dan was in the 
        audience, listening to her recount stories he had heard many times before. 
        He thought Emily was a good speaker, something he was uncomfortable at 
        doing, and was content to hear her tell of events they had both shared.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily had been born Dutch, and had grown up in the East Indies (then under 
        Dutch rule) in the years before the war. As a young woman a bit over twenty, 
        she had met her husband, Dan Vorgstrom, when he came as an American technician 
        to work in the Indies in 1940. They had married there, and had been swept 
        up in the events of 1941 and 1942 when the area was overrun by the Japanese 
        invasion. Under the occupation, most of the foreign population was rounded 
        up and held in internment camps.<BR>
        <BR>
        This had happened to Emily and Dan. As a young couple, without children, 
        they were taken into custody and soon dispatched to be held in a prison 
        camp for internees. As was the custom of their captors, men and women 
        were separated and held in different places; or, as was the case with 
        Emily and Dan, in separate compounds of the same camp.<BR>
        <BR>
        After describing the historical events of the war, Emily usually described 
        what the camps were like, and how they were treated, for this seemed to 
        interest the audiences the most.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily had been taken into the women's compound, along with about a hundred 
        other women, mostly Dutch, British, or Australian. They ranged in age 
        from little girls to old women well over seventy, and there were a few 
        small boys with them. Boys were kept in the women's unit, with their mothers 
        or family members, only if they were younger than about six; older boys 
        went into the men's compound. The women had to work, not so much for their 
        captors, but to sustain their own lives. They were provided rudimentary 
        supplies, a quantity of food rich in rice (the staple of the area), some 
        vegetables, and once in a while a chicken or a few fish. The food kept 
        them above starvation level, but it was hardly abundant. They had to do 
        their own cooking and cleaning. The water supply consisted of system to 
        catch rainwater. In the wet climate, it provided them adequate water to 
        drink and cook, but there was little left for bathing or washing. They 
        had a makeshift shower for bathing, b!<BR>
        ut of course no hot water. The women soon limited themselves to two cold 
        showers a week.<BR>
        <BR>
        There were a few nurses among the inmates, and they tried to attend to 
        medical needs with whatever supplies they could find. Grooming and hygiene 
        was minimal, as they had little to work with. Each woman, if she was lucky, 
        had come with a small bag of clothing and whatever she could scrape together 
        when she was arrested, and some that had been picked up away from their 
        homes had nothing but what they wore. Cosmetics were quickly abandoned 
        as nonexistent. A few of the women had razors, but the blades soon became 
        dull and unusable, and the women found no way to sharpen them. They gave 
        up shaving legs and underarms, and hairy legs and bushy armpits became 
        badges of being internees.<BR>
        <BR>
        While the men were in a separate compound and no visiting was allowed, 
        there were attempts to communicate. Sometimes a guard could be induced 
        to carry a message from one to the other. At one point the two compounds 
        were close enough that rock with an attached message could be tossed, 
        by a strong thrower, from one to the other. Sometimes voices of men could 
        be heard by the women, but any unduly loud yelling was quickly quelled 
        by the guards, so little communication was done in this way.<BR>
        <BR>
        Frequently Emily was asked about the abuse she endured. She was quite 
        frank about it. While there were rumors of women being raped or physically 
        abused in other places, she had not seen it in the camp she was in. It 
        probably happened, but it was not rampant. The abuse she received was 
        more subtle.<BR>
        <BR>
        The camp commander, a minor tyrant she thought, enforced discipline among 
        his troops. They were not permitted to enter the women's barracks except 
        in cases of disorder or a suspected infraction of rules. While the soldiers 
        usually stayed out of the buildings, the women soon realized that suspected 
        rule infractions seemed to occur at times the women could be expected 
        to be dressing or undressing, when soldiers would burst in unannounced 
        and proceed to search the area while the women hastily tried to cover 
        up.<BR>
        <BR>
        The guards were all male soldiers. Emily never saw a female among them. 
        Thus all of the inspections were by men. While it did often occur, surprise 
        inspections were made in other private areas. If an inspection was to 
        be made of the shower facility, it was invariably made while a woman was 
        using it. An inspection of the toilets never seemed to occur unless two 
        or three women had just gone in to use them. Thus the women were subjected 
        to little assaults on their privacy.<BR>
        <BR>
        The camp commander also had his own methods of discipline for the prisoners. 
        While the women gave him little trouble, realizing their fairly helpless 
        situation, some did answer with sarcastic remarks or open insults. If 
        displeased, the commander would prescribe discipline. One woman, after 
        such an incident, was ordered to drink a large amount of water, well over 
        a liter, and then compelled to stand in an open area for a prolonged period, 
        under the watchful eye of her guards, and with no opportunity to relieve 
        herself. Eventually, when she could hold it no longer, she wet herself 
        in her dress, much to the delight of the soldiers. Another woman, after 
        giving the commander some particularly harsh back talk, was ordered to 
        strip in the middle of the compound and made to stand there naked, exposed 
        to everyone's view, for over four hours.<BR>
        <BR>
        Frequently the commander would summon inmates to his office, situated 
        in a small building. To be summoned was not a happy event, for it frequently 
        implied a suspected rule infraction; but often it concerned merely matters 
        of camp administration or work assignments. The women were not viewed 
        as sources of military intelligence, but were often interrogated on their 
        personal histories and skills. Whatever the reason, the commander seemed 
        to enjoy humiliating the women he needed to talk to.<BR>
        <BR>
        Initially, women summoned to the office were simply required to leave 
        their shoes outside the door. The women saw this as a simple observance 
        of a common oriental custom. However, soon the commander decided that 
        this was not enough to humiliate the women into proper respect, so he 
        extended the rule. Each inmate entering the office had to remove her dress 
        (or whatever outer garment she had on) outside, under the watchful eye 
        of a guard, and leave it with her shoes before entering. Thus she was 
        made to enter in whatever underwear she had on. A few of the women had 
        slips, but for most, this meant going in dressed in panties and a brassiere, 
        both increasing ragged as time went on. This not only humiliated the woman, 
        but encouraged her to be cooperative so as to get the matter over as quickly 
        as possible. If she was not compliant in whatever was asked of her, he 
        would commit the final assault on her modesty by commanding her to remove 
        her underclothes and hold them in her !<BR>
        hands, behind her back, while she had to stand in front of his desk naked, 
        until the business was completed.<BR>
        <BR>
        While Emily had asked about her husband during her confinement, she learned 
        little. Requests to visit were simply not entertained, although the women 
        often asked. Probably the men did, too.<BR>
        <BR>
        When Emily finished her recanting of the story, she took questions from 
        her audience. Today, she was asked by one young lady, &quot;Did you ever 
        see your husband while you were in the camp?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily responded, after a bit of hesitation, &quot;Yes, just once. We did 
        have a visit&quot;. She turned to another questioner, but the young lady 
        persisted, &quot;How did you manage that?&quot; It was obvious that Emily 
        wanted to get away from the subject, for she just said &quot;The commander 
        allowed it, but just once in all that time, &quot; and she then went to 
        the next question.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily enjoyed these opportunities, but they ended eventually, and Dan 
        greeted her as she prepared to leave. &quot;I thought you were getting 
        in deep water, there, with that one question, but you handled it well. 
        You got away from the subject, fast!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Do you blame me? What was I going to tell her?&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Emily&quot;, Dan went on, &quot;are you ever going to tell people 
        about that visit we had? Don't tell me you have forgotten it!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Emily smiled at her husband of over forty years, and answered, &quot;So 
        long as I live, I will never forget it! It was the most romantic incident 
        of that awful time. But how could I ever talk in public about something 
        like that? What would our grandchildren think if they ever heard it?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;I think, my darling wife,&quot; said Dan, &quot;they would relate 
        to it a lot better than you feel they would. You might be very surprised!&quot; 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        As they left for the trip home, Emily reflected on that visit of forty 
        years ago. How, indeed, could you ever discuss it with her family or friends? 
        But, then, again, how could she ever forget it. She and Dan shared a memory 
        of that time, often so tragic and awful, yet with its remarkable moments. 
        Her mind went back to a morning in 1942.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily was summoned to the commander's office. This, she knew, was never 
        good news. It was morning, on this warm tropical day, and she approached 
        the office with trepidation. Outside, she performed the required abandonment 
        of her modesty, as she shucked off her dress and placed it beside her 
        shoes at the door, while a soldier watched, his eyes missing nothing. 
        Then, in a ragged bra and panties now showing some small holes, she entered, 
        fearful of what was coming next.<BR>
        <BR>
        The commander kept her standing before him a few minutes, before he addressed 
        her. &quot;Mrs. Vorgstrom, correct?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;, she replied.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Mrs. Vorgstrom, your husband is Dan Vorgstrom, right? &quot; Again, 
        she gave her assent.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;as you are aware, he is held here also. It has been three months, 
        now, that both of you have been here. Would you like an opportunity to 
        visit with him?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily gaped. This was unheard of. She wondered what kind of conditions 
        were about to be attached. <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Mrs. Vorgstrom, we are going to let you have a visit with your husband 
        today. You can not only talk to him, you may touch him, embrace if you 
        wish, stay with him as long as you want, so long as you both abide by 
        the rules.&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        This was unbelievable. To actually be with Dan, to see him, even be in 
        his arms. But what would be the rules?<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;And what are the rules?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Quite simple. I will turn you over to one of my officers, who will 
        arrange it. We will allow you to be together in a designated area. Of 
        course, you cannot be alone. There will be some of the men who will keep 
        their eyes on you. You will have to comply with some instructions on how 
        you are to dress, and until the visit I can allow you no food, only water 
        to slake your thirst. During your visit, you must remain in the designated 
        area, you will both have to remain standing at all times, and of course, 
        you must attend to your toilet functions while you are outside the area, 
        not during the visit. As long as you comply with these rules, you will 
        be allowed to continue your visit.&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily could not understand why they were allowing this. Somewhere, she 
        suspected, there would be something they weren't telling her. It sounded 
        like they were trying to insure they refrained from any intimate embrace, 
        by insisting they stay on their feet and comply with a dress code. Probably 
        they wanted to tease the two of them a bit by letting them meet, but denying 
        them any intimate contact. She didn't care. All she wanted was the chance 
        to see Dan. She did wonder why he had mentioned &quot;toilet functions&quot; 
        - were they going to have them meet in a bathroom, or something like that?<BR>
        <BR>
        Later, Emily would reflect that she was probably chosen for this visit 
        because there were few women there who had husbands near her age. While 
        the women were of varying ages, most of the men were either much older, 
        or just boys. The young men, for the most part, had been in the military 
        services of their countries, and had not been around to be interned. Dan, 
        as an American, had not yet been swept up in America's rearming, which 
        came long after Europe's war began.<BR>
        <BR>
        This day, however, she was concerned only with seeing Dan. A junior officer, 
        speaking much less English than the commander, came and escorted her out 
        the door. As she passed the door, she stooped, attempting to pick up her 
        dress and shoes. She was stopped by her escort. &quot;No - leave! Get 
        later!&quot; was all he said, as he pushed her along into a small vehicle.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily was indeed embarrassed about her condition, but all that really 
        mattered to her right now was seeing Dan. She had been unable to even 
        get a message across the fences, although intermediaries had assured her 
        he was all right and still there. Now she was going to get to see him, 
        but, she thought, what a mess I am. She considered that she was dressed 
        only in bra and panties, ragged at that; she was wearing no make-up, she 
        hadn't had a bath in four days, her legs were hairy with over two months 
        of growth and her underarms were sprouting hairy bushes. <BR>
        <BR>
        The officer took her to a larger building, where she was ordered out. 
        She was taken into a small room, bare except for a table and chair. &quot;Sit&quot; 
        she was told. She sat, and waited.<BR>
        <BR>
        A soldier came in, with a large pot of water, and a cup. It was placed 
        on the table. He left. She waited.<BR>
        <BR>
        After half an hour or so, the officer returned. &quot;Drink!&quot; he 
        commanded. She dipped the cup into the water and took a drink from it. 
        Standard rainwater, the camp's regular stuff, she decided. She put the 
        cup down.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;More!&quot; commanded the officer. She took another cup, wondering 
        where this was leading.<BR>
        <BR>
        About eight cups later, her stomach was feeling decidedly full. But there 
        was still water in the pot, and as fast as she emptied the cup, the officer 
        ordered her to refill it and drink again. He finally gave her a bit of 
        information. Looking at his watch, he announced, &quot;Meet husband - 
        one hour. You have -- long visit!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        She took this to mean she would see Dan in a hour. But now her mind was 
        beginning to put together the pieces of the commander's instructions. 
        She was obviously being filled up with water. She would need to urinate. 
        She had been told no &quot;toilet functions&quot; would be allowed during 
        the visit. Would they allow her to pee before the visit? Unlikely, she 
        thought. They are going to make me hold this water while I meet Dan, and 
        I will only be allowed to stay with him as long as I can hold it!<BR>
        <BR>
        She guessed right. In about fifty minutes, another officer came. He motioned 
        to her to remove her remaining clothes, and leave them on the table. He 
        had a long piece of cloth in his hand, the purpose of which was not immediately 
        clear. Helpless to resist but fearful of what was coming, she took off 
        the bra and panties and laid them on the table. &quot;Can I please pee?&quot; 
        she asked, almost begging. The officer pointed to her now bare crotch 
        with its patch of hair. &quot;Pee? Pee?&quot; he seemed to ask, then answered 
        &quot;No Pee! Visit now - pee later!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        He produced the cloth, which he then used to blindfold her. It was placed 
        over her eyes, and tied. One of the officers then took her hand, and led 
        her, naked, out of the room.<BR>
        <BR>
        She was really worried now. She expected to see Dan, but she couldn't 
        imagine how they were going to do it. She felt utterly humiliated, walking 
        naked and blindfolded, having no idea who was looking at her. He bladder 
        was becoming uncomfortably distended, and getting worse by the minute.<BR>
        <BR>
        She was led for a time, through several doors. She could hear voices of 
        men, and assumed that many were around. She assumed they were probably 
        looking at her. Finally they came to a place where she was told, &quot;steps!&quot; 
        and her hand was placed on an object in front of her. Unsteadily, unable 
        to see, she was steered up several steps onto a smooth surface. &quot;Wait!&quot; 
        she was commanded.<BR>
        <BR>
        She stood there, not knowing who was looking at her, but hearing men's 
        voices all around. Through the blindfold she could sense strong light, 
        so she knew she was standing in a well lit area, with many men around. 
        Where was Dan?<BR>
        <BR>
        After what seemed an eternity, but probably was really only ten minutes, 
        an officer, speaking a bit more English, stepped to her and removed the 
        blindfold. She was shocked at the scene.<BR>
        <BR>
        She was standing on a platform, perhaps twelve feet square, in the middle 
        of a large, well lit room. Soldiers, perhaps fifty or more, were gathered, 
        seated and standing, around the periphery of the room. Across from her, 
        a naked man, blindfolded, was being guided up the steps to the platform. 
        She immediately recognized him as Dan, her husband. Her heart jumped. 
        He looked fairly good; he had several days growth of beard and looked 
        a bit dirty, but it was still Dan! She wanted to reach out and grab him, 
        but the officer held her back for a moment.<BR>
        <BR>
        He addressed them both, as Dan's blindfold was being removed. &quot;You 
        may be together here as long as you want, as long as you follow the rules. 
        Both of you must remain standing at all times. If you sit or lie, even 
        for a moment, the visit is over. You must stay on this platform, and neither 
        of you may pass water, or the visit is terminated. Now you may enjoy your 
        visit; you may talk, touch, do anything, ANYTHING, you want, as long as 
        you keep the rules!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily ran to Dan, and they embraced immediately. Oblivious to the many 
        watchers, they kissed and grabbed each other closely. Then, Emily started 
        to talk - she had so much to say, about how she missed him, how they were 
        being treated. Dan abruptly stopped her.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Emily, I don't know what they made you do, but I know what they 
        did to me! They took my clothes away, and made me drink an enormous amount 
        of water! We can only stay as long as I don't pee, and I just want you 
        to know I need to, very badly, and I don't know how long I can hold out! 
        But, it's so great to even see you, and it's worth all the hurting...I 
        just want to make it last!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;They did it to me, too,&quot; Emily replied, tears in her eyes. 
        &quot;I'm full up; but I'm going to make it last, too!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        They talked and nuzzled, touched and embraced. The discomfort and humiliation 
        was temporarily put aside. They were again two lovers, for a moment.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily's mind had flashed to those words of the officer, &quot;you can 
        do anything, ANYTHING,&quot; she wondered what he was expecting. But she 
        wondered only for a moment, as her feelings caught up to her.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily had been humiliated at being nude in front of all these men, but 
        being nude in front of Dan was different. Suddenly she was glad he could 
        see her, even in the condition she was. She was a normal young married 
        woman, and she hadn't had sex for over three months. A prison camp doesn't 
        provide much for erotic arousal, and she had been concerned with other 
        matters, but now, she felt her hormones raging. As Dan had been brought 
        in naked, she had seen him standing, blindfolded, and his penis was flaccid; 
        but now she could feel it rigidly erect, and brushing against her stomach. 
        She reflected that he presumably hadn't had sex in three months, either, 
        and now he was looking at and embracing his naked wife. Small wonder his 
        organ was hard, pointing upward like an arrow about to fly. She knew what 
        the officer was looking for was a sex show, and that's what he meant by 
        &quot;anything&quot;! They had brought them together to give a sex show 
        for the men watching, but they were being !<BR>
        frustrated by having to remain standing, both with terribly full bladders 
        they were forbidden to empty! The game, obviously, was for the men to 
        enjoy their frustration and see what they would do about it.<BR>
        <BR>
        Emily had been trying to converse sensibly with Dan, but she was hit with 
        pangs of pain from her bladder, now demanding relief. Dan had confessed 
        to her his own desperate need, which he was trying to control. She reached 
        down, seized his penis in her hand, and squeezed it.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Gad, but you feel good!&quot; he responded to her touch. &quot;Hold 
        it tight, maybe it will help keep me from leaking! I need all the help 
        you can give me!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;What about me? You can't help me hold, can you?&quot; He put his 
        hand on her crotch, and held it tightly. Her arousal was apparent from 
        the wetness he felt. &quot;I hope that isn't pee!&quot; he whispered in 
        her ear. &quot;It isn't&quot; she answered back, &quot;but don't push 
        in on me- there is about a gallon of pee inside, and it all wants out! 
        Dan - I need you, I need - we've got to help each other!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        Between snatches of conversation about more mundane matters, they were 
        both very aroused. Dan held her breasts, kissing them and squeezing the 
        nipples, while she protested about her appearance, &quot;Dan, I look awful, 
        and I smell bad; I haven't had a bath in days, my legs are hairy, and..&quot; 
        &quot;You look great. I wouldn't change a thing. Except I wish I had a 
        plug to put in you to keep you from leaking - I want this to go on forever!&quot; 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Dan, you've got a plug, a good one, and I know it fits&quot; she 
        answered quickly, squeezing his penis with her strong fingers. <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Emily, we can't! Oh, I wish we could, but we have to stay standing 
        up! What if you should leak?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Dan&quot;, she answered with confidence, &quot;I need that plug 
        in me! I think I can manage the position - I won't fall; and, anyway, 
        you can hold me by my handles so I don't slip! I think if I have you in 
        me it will be easier to hold on - and I want you so much- so, so, much!&quot; 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Handles?&quot; he asked, squeezing her breasts, one with each hand, 
        admiring her attempt at humor. <BR>
        <BR>
        Carefully, she spread her legs, as he bent backward slightly, both hands 
        holding her breasts. She guided his penis into her, bending back slightly. 
        The onlookers began to cheer, fascinated with the performance.<BR>
        <BR>
        They found it was a difficult balancing act, he holding her by the breasts, 
        she gripping him at the waist, both of them bending backward as he slid 
        into her.<BR>
        <BR>
        They held the position, neither of them moving. She made sounds of mixed 
        pain and pleasure, adding &quot;Never like this - oh, I want you to hold 
        it! Just stay this way! Oh, my bladder! But, it doesn't feel as bad with 
        you there- you've got to stay, it gives me a little relief. Don't move 
        just yet!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        He was in her, and the tightness of her body lessened his own holding 
        problem. She was so tight! She hadn't had sex for months, and with her 
        full bladder forcing her to tighten all of her pelvic muscles, it felt 
        as though his penis was in a vise. They tried to hold the pose. The onlookers 
        quieted down in anticipation.<BR>
        <BR>
        After several minutes, she moved slightly and called to him, &quot;Go 
        on - I can hold it in! Go on - it will help us both hold&quot;. She had 
        her head thrown back, looking upward, still feeling both of his hands 
        holding her firmly by the breasts.<BR>
        <BR>
        He began to move slightly. It wasn't easy, they didn't dare slip and fall. 
        Her grip on him was so tight that his motions were difficult at first, 
        but gradually became easier. <BR>
        <BR>
        As he moved slowly within her, she suddenly said, in a calm voice, &quot;You 
        know, I can't even feel my bladder any more. This has got to be the best 
        way to stop it from hurting!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Me, too,&quot; he answered, &quot;I can't feel my bladder either! 
        Let's keep it going as long as we can!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        He tried to keep his motion slow, despite the intense arousal both of 
        them were now feeling. Slowly she brought her head back to face him, displaying 
        an ecstatic smile. She moved her hands up, holding him by his sides. His 
        grip on her breasts never slackened. He pulled them apart, massaging them 
        with his strong grip, as he manipulated them.<BR>
        <BR>
        Her orgasm came in an ecstatic explosion. Her body jerked, her head jumped 
        backward. He squeezed her nipples hard at the very moment, not yet reaching 
        his own explosive point. He continued to thrust a moment or two, then 
        reached his own climax with a loud moan and a sudden cessation of his 
        movement.<BR>
        <BR>
        Gradually they came down from the clouds, looking at each other, still 
        standing there, hands on each other, ignoring the onlookers. They had 
        stayed on their feet. Neither had peed. They were still connected.<BR>
        <BR>
        She still had her sense of humor. &quot;You want out?&quot; she asked, 
        &quot;I still need the plug, you know. Bladder's still full. Oh, it's 
        starting to hurt again!&quot; <BR>
        <BR>
        He slowly withdrew his now flaccid member. She immediately took it in 
        her hand and squeezed tightly near the tip. &quot;Keep the valve shut 
        - I don't want to lose you yet!&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        Sexually relieved, thoroughly enjoying each other, they stood together 
        in an odd posture; she, holding the tip of his penis in a tight grasp, 
        and he pressing his fingers through her labia, trying to press her urethra 
        closed. The pain of their bladders both drew them together in a common 
        misery, and forced them to face their coming separation when one or the 
        other could no longer hold it.<BR>
        <BR>
        They kept it up half an hour or so, conversing quietly. They stood together, 
        hardly moving their feet, but both fidgeting and twitching nervously throughout 
        their lower bodies. Then came the breaking point as he exclaimed to her, 
        &quot;Try holding it tighter, right at the tip; I can't hold back any 
        longer!&quot; She tightened her grip at the tip of his penis, trying hard 
        to pinch it shut. It didn't work. There was a slight spurt from the tip. 
        She squeezed tighter, but it was too late. The watchers noticed. Men moved 
        to separate them, starting to pull him away. His urine started to shoot 
        out in a stream, falling to the platform. They grasped each other for 
        one final embrace, as he was dragged away, peeing furiously.<BR>
        <BR>
        She was pulled off the platform, taken down the steps. The officer escorted 
        her out the door. As they stepped to the outdoors, he stood her on the 
        bare ground adjoining the building. He pointed down. &quot;Pee!&quot; 
        he commanded. She complied, legs spread, still standing, a forceful stream 
        pouring from her. She could see a group of soldiers watching. She didn't 
        care. She had her Dan. They had made her stand, and she was still on her 
        feet.<BR>
        <BR>
        She was led back to the room where her underwear had been left. She was 
        allowed hastily to put on her meager cover, and then was driven back to 
        the women's compound. At the commander's office, she retrieved her dress 
        and shoes. She walked to her barracks. She had not felt so good in a long 
        time.<BR>
        <BR>
        She didn't get to see Dan again, until their release over two years later. 
        <BR>
        <BR>
        As Emily and Dan arrived at their house, he again asked her if she was 
        still thinking about the visit they had those forty years ago. She turned 
        to him with her usual smile, &quot;Could I ever forget that? But, Dan, 
        how could I ever tell it to anyone else?&quot;<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;Would you go through it again&quot;, Dan asked her.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;I'll never have to. I'm an old lady now&quot;. They unlocked the 
        door and went in. &quot;It's been a long day,&quot; she continued. &quot;I 
        haven't had a bathroom break since before the program. I badly need a 
        pee, and a shower, and I'm ready for bed!&quot; She put down her belongings 
        and started toward the bathroom. Dan grabbed her, gently.<BR>
        <BR>
        &quot;I need a bathroom stop, too, and I like your menu, but let's change 
        the order a bit. There was a time when you were willing to put off the 
        pee and the shower..&quot; his voice trailed off, as he kissed her lightly. 
        Then he pulled her away from the direction of the bathroom, pointing her 
        toward their bedroom instead. As they went through the door, he turned 
        her around and reached to unbutton her blouse, only to find she already 
        had it completely unfastened, and was unsnapping her bra.. Dropping both 
        on a chair, she turned to him bare breasted, and gave him that smile again, 
        saying &quot;At least it's going to be a bed, and not standing on a platform, 
        but you can still use the handles.&quot; As he followed her instructions, 
        she shook her head, adding, &quot;How would you ever tell the grandchildren?&quot;
