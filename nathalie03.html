    <br>
    By the time I was 20 I was working as an estate agent with my Dad, that meant that he was
    doing most of the paperwork to start with while I showed people around houses. On my third
    day at work I had been out all morning with a family of four and we had visited half a
    dozen houses by 1.30pm, which was well into my lunchtime. They were staying in a hotel in
    the town and I dropped them off there before driving back to the office on the other side
    of town. I remember the trip well as by then I was really looking forward to having a pee.
    I hadn't been since before breakfast and had been given coffee by four of the vendors as
    we looked around so my poor little bladder was now quite full. As I have said before, I've
    always been very shy of asking for the loo, especially with strangers so I knew that from
    now on I would have to be carefull not to drink too much when out with clients.<br>
    <br>
    My afternoon apointment was scheduled for 2pm so I reckoned to be able to have a pee and a
    bite to eat before that, but had forgotten to take into account the heavy lunchtime
    traffic. I reached the office at five to and hurriedly parked the car, not even bothering
    to lock it in my haste. As I reached the door and was fumbling with the keys to open up -
    Dad wouldn't be back for at least another 30 mins - I was hopping from foot to foot in
    anticipation of having a wee. A voice behind me made me jump and I turned to see a man of
    about 50 and a boy of about 14 or 15 who turned out to be his son. This was my client,
    without his wife who was apparently not feeling well, and I groaned inwardly as I let them
    in, hoping to find an excuse to somehow use the loo soon. They sat across the desk from me
    as we talked and I showed some photos, although I wasn't really able to concentrate as
    well as I should, as my bladder started to give more urgent signals of distress. At least
    I could put one hand to good use under the desk without anyone seeing so I didn't have to
    wriggle too much.<br>
    <br>
    The problem with my office is that the only toilet is through a door directly out of the
    office and with the thinness of the walls the sound of someone weeing is clearly audible
    to anyone on the other side. No way could I bring myself to go while these two were
    sitting there listening. Instead, I tried to arrange for any viewing to be done the next
    day so I could get rid of them as soon as possible but this was not acceptable to them and
    it was a case of now or never.<br>
    <br>
    Luckily there were only two properties suitable and I hoped to race them through in under
    an hour - I wasn't sure if I could hang on that long but there wasn't much choice. As we
    left the office I had the bright idea of nipping back in, leaving them outside, on the
    excuse that I needed to make a quick phone call to check if the vendors were in. Really, I
    was hoping to have a pee of course and a wave of pressure hit me as I thought of it. As I
    got to the loo door though, I turned to see 'junior' looking in through the window and I
    had to reach for the phone instead and pretend to use it. I sat down at the desk and
    squirmed about on the chair, my spare hand pressed hard between my legs. He stayed put,
    and then I realised that from where he was he had a clear view under my desk and could see
    what I was doing. I felt my face go beetroot red and I suddenly felt very hot in my
    embarrassment. I quickly moved my hand and that, combined with the shock of being caught
    like that, even if only by a schoolboy, made me momentarily lose control of my straining
    bladder and a spurt of hot pee escaped into my pale blue cotton panties. Putting the phone
    down, I managed a smile at my observer at the window and, praying that the back of my
    short pleated skirt, being black, didn't show any signs of wetness I went back outside. I
    was more or less under control again by then and it helped to be moving.<br>
    <br>
    Once at the wheel of my little Peugeot I regretted not having accepted to offer of going
    in the client's car and was finding it rather difficult to drive smoothly and keep up a
    conversation with sales-talk at the same time.15 mins later we arrived at the first house
    and only after knocking on the door did I realise that no-one was in. 'I thought you
    checked' said the man. 'I tried but there was no answer' I replied weakly, glad that all
    the same I had brought the key. The cold air made me want to pee even more by now and I
    had to admit to myself that I couldn't possibly last much longer - I was really full to
    bursting and discomfort had become pain, I couldn't even walk normally as I quickly showed
    them around. Opening the bathroom door was the last straw! There was a loo, right in front
    of me, and as is <br>
    often the case, the sight of it caused yet another wave of desperation to hit me. Unable
    to use my hands with my two clients watching - and one of them, very much aware of my
    predicament, was watching every move - I had to do a little dance and to bend at the waist
    until the feeling eased a little. However, I was losing the battle and another little
    spurt of pee had escaped and was now tricling down the inside of one thigh. I gritted my
    teeth and suggested we looked at the garden, knowing what I had to do next to aviod a
    really serious accident. When we reached the lawn I was on the point of losing control
    completely and despite the cold I was perspiring with the effort needed to contain
    myself.I stopped and let them get a little ahead, then, as my bladder began to give way
    and I began to dribble into my knickers, I squatted down and pretended to re-tie the laces
    on one of my ankle boots. I let go completely, there was no choice anyway, and felt a
    fantastic feeling of relief as the hot pee gushed out through my panties, luckily not
    making too much noise on the grass. I must have closed my eyes and when I looked up,
    junior was watching me again - he might not have actually seen the floodgates open but I
    was sure he knew exactly what I had done. Thank goodness for a short skirt, it hadn't got
    wet and I was able to hike it up as I sat in the driver's seat too keep it dry without
    showing too much leg or the wet crotch of my knickers, although my client, in the
    passenger seat did cast a few glances in that direction.<br>
    <br>
    And he did finally buy the house, despite my lack of attention to him that afternoon!</font><p
