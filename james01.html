    an introduction</strong></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The following is a true and honest account of my wife, only her name has been changed.
    I met my wife some 14 years ago, while at the University. Jennifer was and still is a very
    hard working lady as well as a loving wife. She is 5ft. 10in.tall, weighs 9stone 12lbs,
    has dark hair and a tremendous figure. We married in 1990 and Jennifer qualified as a
    chartered accountant the following year. She now works for a large accountancy firm in
    Manchester, England. I have been to a number of professional functions with her and she
    has always turned men&#146;s heads. When she goes to work she always wears a fitted suit
    and tights. The skirt is usually short enough to show off her legs but not so short as to
    make her look like a tart.</p>
    <p>Jennifer - though I hate to say it because I so hate the word - is mildly incontinent,
    though, as she prefers to say, &quot;she suffers from the occasional involuntary
    relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles.&quot; Over the last 14 years I have seen 19 major
    accidents (where she has ended up in, stood, or sat in a puddle) and have been aware of
    four others. On average I would say she had a major flood every 3 or 4 months. The number
    of times I witnessed her having to change during the day or pee behind a bush or the car
    is countless. Over the following weeks I will relay some of the accidents. Why you ask?
    Well, I am so very turned on by them and as of yet I have never told her. I think she
    would have a fit if she knew. </font></p>
